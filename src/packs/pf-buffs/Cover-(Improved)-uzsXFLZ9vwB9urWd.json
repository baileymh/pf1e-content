      "value": "<p>In some cases, such as attacking a target hiding behind an arrowslit, cover may provide a greater bonus to AC and Reflex saves. In such situations, the normal cover bonuses to AC and Reflex saves can be doubled (to +8 and +4, respectively). A creature with this improved cover effectively gains improved evasion against any attack to which the Reflex save bonus applies. Furthermore, improved cover provides a +10 bonus on Stealth checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Improved Cover and Attacks of Opportunity</strong></p>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with improved cover relative to you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Improved Cover and Stealth Checks</strong></p>\n<p>You can use improved cover to make a Stealth check. Without cover, you usually need concealment (see below) to make a Stealth check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Big Creatures and Cover</strong></p>\n<p>Any creature with a space larger than 5 feet (1 square) determines cover against melee attacks slightly differently than smaller creatures do. Such a creature can choose any square that it occupies to determine if an opponent has cover against its melee attacks. Similarly, when making a melee attack against such a creature, you can pick any of the squares it occupies to determine if it has cover against you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
