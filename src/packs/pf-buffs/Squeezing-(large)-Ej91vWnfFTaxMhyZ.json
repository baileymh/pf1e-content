You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. Each move into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls and a &ndash;4 penalty to AC.</p>\n<p>When a Large creature (which normally takes up 4 squares) squeezes into a space that&rsquo;s 1 square wide, the creature&rsquo;s token occupies 2 squares, centered on the line between the 2 squares. For a bigger creature, center the creature likewise in the area it squeezes into.</p>\n<p>A creature can squeeze past a creature while moving but it can&rsquo;t end its movement in an occupied square.</p>",
