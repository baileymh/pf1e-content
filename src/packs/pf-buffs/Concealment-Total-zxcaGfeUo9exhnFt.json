      "value": "<p>If you have line of effect to a target but not line of sight, he is considered to have total concealment from you. You can&rsquo;t attack an opponent that has total concealment, though you can attack into a square that you think he occupies. A successful attack into a square occupied by an enemy with total concealment has a 50% miss chance (instead of the normal 20% miss chance for an opponent with concealment).</p>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t execute an&nbsp;attack of opportunity&nbsp;against an opponent with total concealment, even if you know what square or squares the opponent occupies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Concealment and Stealth Checks</strong></p>\n<p>You can use concealment to make a&nbsp;Stealth&nbsp;check. Without concealment, you usually need&nbsp;cover&nbsp;to make a&nbsp;Stealth check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ignoring Concealment</strong></p>\n<p>Concealment isn&rsquo;t always effective. An area of dim lighting or darkness doesn&rsquo;t provide any concealment against an opponent with&nbsp;darkvision. Characters with&nbsp;low-light vision&nbsp;can see clearly for a greater distance than other characters with the same light source. Although invisibility provides total concealment, sighted opponents may still make&nbsp;Perception&nbsp;checks to notice the location of an&nbsp;invisible&nbsp;character. An&nbsp;invisible&nbsp;character gains a +20 bonus on&nbsp;Stealth&nbsp;checks if moving, or a +40 bonus on&nbsp;Stealth&nbsp;checks when not moving (even though opponents can&rsquo;t see you, they might be able to figure out where you are from other visual or auditory clues).</p>",
