This ritual has no visible effect to mortal eyes, but it creates a powerful rending cut in the world of spirits. By successfully completing this ritual, the caster can achieve one of two goals: severing a kami from its ward, or untethering a bound companion.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Sever Kami Ward</strong>: Successfully completing the ritual forces the ward's kami to attempt a Will save (use the kami's Will save in the case of targeting its ward). On a failed save, the kami loses its connection with its ward. This functions as if the kami's ward were destroyed: the kami cannot merge with its ward, it loses its fast healing, and it is permanently sickened. Many kami suffering from this cruel fate transform into malicious oni. </p><p></p><p><strong>Untether Companion</strong>: Successfully completing the ritual forces the creature whose animal or spiritual companion, such as an eidolon or phantom, was targeted to attempt a Will save. Failing this save causes the creature to lose its bond with the targeted animal companion or spirit. An animal companion severed in this manner retains its abilities and statistics, but it gains an intense loathing for its former master. In the case of eidolons or phantoms, the severed companion gains the unfettered eidolon template or becomes an unfettered phantom with the appropriate Hit Dice. For creatures with animal companions, this functions as if the creature's companion had been slain, allowing the target to gain a new companion. For creatures with bonded spirits (such as spiritualists), the means of gaining a new companion are left to the GM's discretion.</p>",
