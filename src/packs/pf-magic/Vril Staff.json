      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This hollow, silver staff is covered in intricate glyphs and  flute-like keys, and allows use of the following spells:  • Mage hand (1 charge)  • Cure light wounds (1 charge)  • Cure moderate wounds (2 charges)  • Telekinesis (2 charges)  • Repulsion (3 charges)  If the wielder of a vril staff is a spellcaster, as a standard action, she can expend 1 charge and sacrifice a prepared spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher to channel the power through the staff as a blast of raw magical energy known as vril. This ray resolves as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet, and the wielder chooses whether it deals damage or heals. The amount of damage dealt or healed by the ray is equal to 1d6 points per level of the spell sacrificed + 1 point per caster level of the wielder.  In the hands of a kineticist, the staff functions differently. By spending 1 charge from the staff as part of her kinetic blast, the kineticist can use a new basic energy blast called a vril blast. This blast deals untyped damage. A vril blast works only with form and substance infusions that specify that they work on any blast. If the kineticist instead spends 3 charges, her vril blast's intensity increases and it ignores spell resistance. A kineticist can use a vril staff without attempting a Use Magic Device check.  A spellcaster can recharge a vril staff normally. A kineticist can restore a single charge to a vril staff by accepting 3 points of burn.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Staff, cure light wounds, cure moderate wounds, mage hand, repulsion, telekinesis</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Occult Adventures",
