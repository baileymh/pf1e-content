      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Cut from the colorful flesh of an enormous frog, this +1 hide armor squishes thickly and tightly around the body as it is donned. Light sheens brightly off the slippery skin, revealing vivid patterns in myriad hues.  Five times per day as a swift action, the wearer of a vibrant frog hide can cause the armor to ooze a virulent toxin. The next creature that touches the wearer must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1d3 points of Wisdom damage every round for 4 rounds. A poisoned creature can attempt the save again at the beginning of each of its turns, and is  cured after one successful save. Successful unarmed strikes and natural weapon attacks made by or against the wearer count as touching. The wearer is immune to his own vibrant frog hide's poison.  After being worn for 24 hours, a suit of vibrant frog hide armor causes the wearer to grow a froglike tongue. The tongue acts as a whip for the purposes of damage, reach, and special features, except that it is a natural weapon with which the wearer is automatically proficient. In addition to its normal trip and disarm weapon features, the tongue may also be used to perform a dragAPG combat maneuver with a +2 circumstance bonus, but only to pull a creature closer to the wearer (the wearer cannot step back as part of this attack). The wearer cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components for 1 round after he uses his new tongue to attack (including any attacks of opportunity).<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +1 hide armor</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, beast shape II, poison</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Down The Blighted Path",
