      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Sleek dull gray stripes line the sides of this +1 mithral chain shirt, slightly marring the otherwise shining metal. When worn, the wearer's clothing and hair dance about as though caught in a faint breeze, no matter the prevailing weather conditions.  Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer can momentarily transform into a surge of living wind, moving up to 60 feet in a straight line. This line need not be horizontal; the effect can be used to traverse hazards or reach elevated platforms. All creatures in the line between the wearer's starting point and destination are blasted by the squall. The wearer attempts a trip combat maneuver against every creature in the area, with a +5 circumstance bonus on those checks. Failed trip attempts do not stop the wearer's movement, and these maneuvers and movement do not provoke any attacks of opportunity. Any flying creature in the area must succeed at a DC 15 Fly check or fall 20 feet, taking appropriate damage and falling prone if it reaches a solid surface.  Creatures more than one size category larger than the wearer are not affected by a wearer taking advantage of a suit of windstrider mail's living wind effect, but they do not inhibit the wearer's movement. If the wearer's path is blocked by an object, such as a door, she may continue moving forward with a successful Strength check to break the obstacle as a free action. If this check fails, her movement is halted and she takes damage as if she had fallen the distance that she traveled. If the wearer's movement does not end on a surface that can support her weight, she falls to the ground upon transforming back.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +1 mithral chain shirt</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Magic Arms and Armor, gaseous form, gust of wind</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Down The Blighted Path",
