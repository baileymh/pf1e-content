      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>A heavy chain dangles from the end of this 4-foot-long iron staff, ending in a manacle that must be secured to the wielder's wrist in order for the staff's powers to function. The wielder can command the manacle to lock or unlock, or it can be removed with a DC 25 Strength check. The wielder can cast the spells from this staff as if they were on her spell list. The staff allows the use of the following spells.  • command (1 charge)  • greater command (2 charges)  • dominate person (4 charges)   Any creature that fails a saving throw against a command spell cast from the staff suffers a -2 penalty on saving throws against greater command spells cast from the staff for the next 24 hours. If the same creature then fails a saving throw against a greater command spell cast from the staff, that creature suffers a -4 penalty against dominate person spells cast from the staff for the next 24 hours, as well as any saves to break free from the spell as long as it persists. If the staff's wielder dies or the staff is destroyed, all spells previously cast from it automatically end.  The staff's creators intentionally placed a curse on it: the staff forces any wielder who is not a duergar worshiper of Droskar to obey the same actions that she tries to command others to perform. The wielder automatically fails saving throws against these effects. The staff does not function at all for dwarves.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Staff, command, greater command, dominate person</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>PFS 8-03",
