The platform cannot withstand a carried weight of more than 3,000 lbs.<br/><br/> A wind platform has AC 4, harness 5, and 250 hp, and takes double damage from acid and fire attacks. When reduced to half its total hit points (125 hp) the platform begins to descend at a rate of 20 ft. per round. When reduced to one-quarter its total hit points (62 hp), the rate of descent increases to 60 ft. per round. When destroyed, all creatures and items on the wind platform simply fall as normal.</p>",
