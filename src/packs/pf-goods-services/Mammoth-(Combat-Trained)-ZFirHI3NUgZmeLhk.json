A favored beast of burden among Kellid tribes, mammoths are more temperamental than elephants. Combat-trained mammoths are used primarily as mounts by the Kellid tribes of the Realm of the Mammoth Lords. Such beasts might be bought from some tribes, but for a more significant cost. Many Kellids sell mammoths only to those they trust to both respect the animals and not turn the powerful beasts back against their tribe. For more information, see the <em>Bestiary</em>.</p>",
