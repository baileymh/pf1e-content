      "value": "<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Lost Treasures pg. 43</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 2,500 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Black Market</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2><p>This white sea-bird feather is millennia old and coated with a thin, resinous substance that has rendered the feather as rigid as steel. When the feather is rubbed or struck, its barbs jangle against each other, emitting a curious polytonal hum like that of several tuning forks. The feather is firmly affixed to a jeweled turban pin.<br/><br/> The shaft of the feather is covered with tiny Kelish script. If read-a difficult task without magnification due to the miniscule writing-the text reveals the history of the lands of Qadira before and during the establishment of the Keleshite satrapy at the end of the Age of Destiny. This acts as a library on the history of Qadira. A character with access to the feather can attempt Knowledge (history) checks about Qadira that have a DC higher than 10, even if untrained in the skill. Characters trained in Knowledge (history) can attempt a second check after studying the feather for an hour if they fail a Knowledge (history) check on such subjects.</p>",
