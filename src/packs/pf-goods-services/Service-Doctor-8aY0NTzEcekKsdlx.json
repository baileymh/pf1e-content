A typical doctor is a 3rd-level expert with 3 ranks in Heal, the Skill Focus (Heal) feat, and ranks in other valuable skills such as Knowledge (nature) and Knowledge (religion). An experienced doctor is up to 5th level, has additional ranks in appropriate skills, and is paid five to 10 times as much; however, these doctors are in high demand and are usually employed full-time by royalty. A doctor generally knows a little bit about what local magical healing can do and where to find it. The listed price is per day.</p>",
