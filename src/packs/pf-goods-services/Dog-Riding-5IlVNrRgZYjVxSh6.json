Guard dogs are sold in most large cities and some cultures use them for sport fighting or in some armies' special infantry. More information on dogs can be found in the Bestiary.<br/><br/> <em>Lap Dog</em>: These tiny dogs are commonly kept as pets. They cannot be combat trained, but can serve as noisy-but-skittish watch creatures. Lap dogs have the same statistics as foxes (see Bestiary 3).<br/><br/> <em>Riding Dog</em>: This Medium dog is bred for carrying Small riders, and is combat trained. Breeders select dogs with strong backs, endurance, and loyal dispositions and train them for riding and combat before sale. Reputable breeders can be found in major cities. More information on riding dogs can be found in the Bestiary.</p>",
