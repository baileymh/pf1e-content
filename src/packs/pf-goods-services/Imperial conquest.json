While the game can be played with less expensive sets, only a suitably intricate and well-crafted game set can generate the state of mind necessary to gain the tactical benefits of the game. Imperial conquest is a great intellectual pursuit across the breadth of the Padishah Empire, but the game has only recently begun to spread through the Inner Sea region.<br/><br/> Up to four people can play a game of imperial conquest, which generally takes 1-2 hours (4d20+20 minutes). At the end of an uninterrupted game, each player attempts a DC 20 Intelligence check, with success granting tactical insights. For the next 8 hours, any character who succeeded at the Intelligence check gains a +1 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity; when two players who succeeded at the Intelligence check flank the same enemy during this time, the bonus on attack rolls from flanking increases by 1.</p>",
