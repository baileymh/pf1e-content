After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br/><br/> <strong>Black Cumin</strong>: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Flaming Sumac</strong>: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease's effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Golden Cardamom</strong>: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual's body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Striped Nutmeg</strong>: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Sunrise Cinnamon</strong>: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Tiger Cloves</strong>: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br/><br/> <strong>Violet Salt</strong>: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body's water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.</p>",
