You can also use this time to study under a more learned teacher. If neither a student nor a teacher is available, spend the hour working on a literacy primer, book of fables, or other educational text to be donated to a school or library. After devoting an hour to this work, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks for the next 24 hours.</p><h3 class=\"framing\">On Golarion</h3><p><b>Centers of Worship</b> Absalom, Jalmeray, Katapesh, Mana Wastes, Qadira, Nex, Osirion, Vudra<br /><b>Nationality</b> Vudrani</p><h2 class=\"title\">Boons - <a href=\"FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Deific Obedience\">Deific Obedience</a></h2><p></p><h3 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> Evangelist</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01vao\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Faiths of Golarion pg. 17</i></a><br /><b>1: Transcendent Mind (Sp)</b> <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=burst of insight\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>burst of insight</i></a> 3/day, <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=calm emotions\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>calm emotions</i></a> 2/day, or <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=share language, communal\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>communal share language</i></a> 1/day<br /><b>2: Clarity's Blessing (Su)</b> The clarity of your teaching can shelter others from certain mental assaults. Once per day as a swift action, you can invoke Gruhastha's blessing to grant companions within 60 feet a +4 sacred bonus on saves against confusion and fear effects. You can protect a number of people equal to your Hit Die, and the protection lasts for an hour.<br /><b>3: Keeper's Mercy (Su)</b> Though you are willing to use violence in the face of implacable evils, it is always a last resort and used as precisely and minimally as possible. Even in the midst of combat, you do your best to reduce true harm. For a number of rounds per day equal to your Hit Dice, you can cause your own attacks with unarmed strikes, weapons, and natural weapons or those of another creature within 10 feet of you to deal nonlethal damage. Damage dealt to creatures or objects that are not subject to nonlethal damage is not converted and remains lethal damage. An unwilling target can negate this effect with a successful Will save (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier).</p><h3 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbolN.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"Gruhastha's second exalted boon grants the constant benefits of�comprehend languages�instead of the listed benefit.\" /> Exalted</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01vao\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Faiths of Golarion pg. 17</i></a><br /><b>1: Push Toward Peace (Sp)</b> <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=know the enemy\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>know the enemy</i></a> 3/day, <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=enthrall\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>enthrall</i></a> 2/day, or <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=suggestion\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>suggestion</i></a> 1/day<br /><b>2: Restore Lost Learning (Su)</b> The Keeper is an embodiment of a sacred text, and the written word is of tremendous importance to you. You have a sacred connection to books and other written records that allows you to commune with them, even when they have been irreparably damaged. Given a fragment of a written or etched text, you can divine the missing portion of the text at the rate of 100 words per day. Magical or cursed texts can resist this effect or return incomplete results at the GM's discretion.<br /><b>3: Call the Keeper (Sp)</b> You both learn from and teach the finest of Gruhastha's scholars. Once per day as a standard action, you can summon a Keeper of Lore (<a href=\"MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Manu\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">advanced manu manasaputra</a>) to consult on a topic of your choice for 1 hour. A Keeper of Lore has a +25 bonus on Knowledge checks. A Keeper of Lore will not serve in combat except under the most desperate circumstances, and regular use of the manasaputra in combat is considered an abuse of Gruhastha's gift.</p><h3 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> Sentinel</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01vao\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Faiths of Golarion pg. 17</i></a><br /><b>1: Speaker of Fable (Sp)</b> <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=speak with animal\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>speak with animal</i></a> 3/day, <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=animal messenger\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>animal messenger</i></a> 2/day, or <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=animal aspect, greater\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>greater animal aspect</i></a> 1/day<br /><b>2: Trace Corruption (Su)</b> You are a champion of the truth, and have been granted the divine insight to know when other creatures are being forced to act counter to their own natures. You can detect charms, compulsions, and possession effects, as per <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=detect charm\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>detect charm</i></a>, by concentrating for 1 round on a single creature within 100 feet. If you identify such an effect, you can concentrate for another round to obtain a glimpse of the effect's creator in your mind's eye. Such images are foggy and fragmentary, sufficient to determine the creature's type and a vague description, but not enough to identify individuals unless they bear unusual distinguishing marks. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to half your Hit Dice.<br /><b>3: Sacred Tutelage (Su)</b> Though you are willing to confront dangers directly, you also educate fellow companions and like-minded faiths in the best practices for defeating their shared foes; as it is written in the Azvadeva Pujila, each warrior can aim only a single spear, but a teacher can aim ten thousand. As a swift action, you can provide divine guidance to your allies in combat. Allies able to see you gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls. You can provide your guidance for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice per day (maximum 20 rounds). The rounds in which you provide guidance don't need to be consecutive, and you can end this ability as a free action.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Paladin Code</h2>Paladins of Gruhastha are rare, for the Keeper's is not a martial faith. Those who champion his faith through arms typically do so out of need to travel to secluded villages or because they are sworn to protect specific holy sites or teachers. The code of Gruhastha's paladins contains the following adages. <ul><li>Transcendence requires tranquility. No one can learn who is hungry or afraid. My first goal must be to ensure peace and stability for the greatest number of people possible. </li><li>Enlightenment requires truth. I will not deny knowledge to those who seek answers without ill will, even if it seems to be harmful in the short term, as those who have false information will follow a false path. </li><li>All can find their way to enlightenment. Whenever possible, intelligent creatures should be reasoned with and their grievances understood. Even if no negotiated resolution is possible, the use of force is always to be regretted, for it represents a failure. </li><li>Ignorance is not malice. The misguided deserve mercy. They should be shown the error of their ways and given a fair chance to make amends. </li><li>Malice creates ignorance. Those who deliberately blind themselves to the concerns of others, the consequences of their actions, or the obligations of empathy spread and encourage these behaviors to those around them. Those who mislead others or argue in bad faith for the sake of their own selfishness must be opposed, and the truth of their actions revealed.</li> <h2 class=\"title\">Unique Spell Rules</h2><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> <b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01vao\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Faiths of Golarion pg. 19</i></a><br /><p></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Cleric/Warpriest</h3><p><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Burst of Insight\">Burst of Insight</a></i> can be prepared as a 1st-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Object Reading\">Object Reading</a></i> can be prepared as a 2nd-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Clairaudience/Clairvoyance\">Clairaudience/Clairvoyance</a></i> can be prepared as a 3rd-level spell<br /></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Inquisitor</h3><p><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Burst of Insight\">Burst of Insight</a></i> can be prepared as a 1st-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Object Reading\">Object Reading</a></i> can be prepared as a 2nd-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Clairaudience/Clairvoyance\">Clairaudience/Clairvoyance</a></i> can be prepared as a 3rd-level spell<br /></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Paladin</h3><p><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Burst of Insight\">Burst of Insight</a></i> can be prepared as a 1st-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Object Reading\">Object Reading</a></i> can be prepared as a 2nd-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Clairaudience/Clairvoyance\">Clairaudience/Clairvoyance</a></i> can be prepared as a 3rd-level spell<br /><br /></p></ul><p></p><div style=\"position:relative;left:0%;border:2px ridge #434343;width:100%;height:100%\"><div class=\"wiki-content-full\"><iframe style=\"overflow-y:hidden;width:100%;height:450px\" src=\"https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Gruhastha\"> </iframe></div>\n </div>",
