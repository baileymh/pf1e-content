While doing so, you can cause your voice to emanate from that flame, either as your normal voice or as a crackling, inhuman one. Once per day while using this ability, you can cast <i>mass suggestion</i> as a spell-like ability, but the spell originates from the distant flame rather than from you.<br /><b>3: Face in Flames (Su)</b> A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, you can reshape a campfiresized flame to produce the effects of <i>major image</i>. Whatever shape you create appears to be made of flame and occupies roughly a 5-foot cube, even if it is part of a larger fire. You can end the effect as a free action, causing the flames to erupt in a 5-foot-radius burst that deals 1d6 points of fire damage if you so choose. This damage increases by 1d6 for every additional round you maintained the <i>major image</i>, but can deal no more than 1d6 points of fire damage per Hit Die you have. Causing a flame to erupt in this way extinguishes the flame. You can use this ability in tandem with Voice in Flames.</p><h3 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> Exalted</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9jb9?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-105-The-Inferno-Gate\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Pathfinder #105: The Inferno Gate pg. 73</i></a><br /><b>1: Fire Starter (Sp)</b> <i>produce flame</i> 3/day, <i>heat metal</i> 2/day, or <i>flame arrow</i> 1/day<br /><b>2: Mark of Flame (Su)</b> By dealing fire damage to a creature using a spell or spell-like ability, you can temporarily brand that creature with a coin-sized, smoldering image of Moloch's unholy symbol for 1 minute. While marked, the creature takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against all fire effects. A creature can remove this brand with <i>erase</i> or <i>remove curse</i>.<br /><b>3: Accept the Flame (Su)</b> Three times per day, you can gain immunity to fire for a number of rounds per day equal to your Wisdom modifier. Track any fire damage you take during this time. For 1 minute after you end the effect, your body becomes uncomfortably warm, and once as a standard action you can use a melee touch attack to deal an amount of fire damage equal to the damage your immunity prevented (maximum 10 points of fire damage for every Hit Die you have) and cause the attack's target to catch fire (<i>Core Rulebook</i> 444). A successful Fortitude save halves the damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier). If you do not touch another creature before the end of this minute, you take all of the damage your immunity prevented-neither fire resistance nor fire immunity can reduce this damage.</p><h3 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> Sentinel</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9jb9?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-105-The-Inferno-Gate\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Pathfinder #105: The Inferno Gate pg. 73</i></a><br /><b>1: Pyrebrand (Sp)</b> <i>produce flame</i> 3/day, <i>flame blade</i> 2/day, or <i>phantom steed</i> 1/day<br /><b>2: Ceremonial Pyre (Su)</b> Once per day as a swift action, you can cause all creatures within 15 feet of you to catch fire (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier, Reflex negates); they burn for 1 minute or until the flames are extinguished. Each round that they're on fire, affected creatures take an additional 1d6 points of fire damage per 6 Hit Dice you have (maximum 4d6). If you begin your turn within 15 feet of a creature taking damage from this ability, you gain fast healing 10 for 1 round.<br /><b>3: Sacrificial Pyre (Su)</b> When you confirm a critical hit against a foe, it must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + your base attack bonus) or catch fire. While the target is on fire, caustic smoke obscures its vision, and it treats all other creatures as though they had concealment. Creatures killed while on fire from this ability are immediately reduced to ashes, leaving behind no remains.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Boons - <a href=\"FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Fiendish Obedience\">Fiendish Obedience</a></h2><p></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Evangelist</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Book of the Damned pg. 80</i></a><br /><b>1: Command Infernal Legions (Sp)</b> <i>command </i> 3/day, <i>blistering invective</i> 2/day, or <i>witness</i> 1/day<br /><b>2: Edicts of Malebolge (Sp)</b> When the Ashen Bull speaks a command, wise mortals know to obey without thought. Similarly, you can harness your lord's commanding infernal presence to repel your enemies and keep them at bay. Twice per day, you can cast <i>repulsion</i> as a spell-like ability.<br /><b>3: Loyal Servant (Sp)</b> You command incredible infernal might at the pleasure of Moloch, and you can use this dark power to reach into nearly any creature's puny mind, bending its will to serve the Lord of the Sixth's whims as you see fit. Once per day, you can cast <i>dominate monster</i> as a spell-like ability.</p><h3 class=\"framing\">Exalted</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Book of the Damned pg. 80</i></a><br /><b>1: Fires of Malebolge (Sp)</b> <i>burning hands </i> 3/day, <i>fire breath</i> 2/day, or <i>fireball</i> 1/day<br /><b>2: Ballistae of Flame and Ash (Sp)</b> Although this knowledge cows most mortals, you understand that a being of pure, evil hellfire lives under the Ashen Bull's infernal armor. Instead of fearing it, you embrace this hellish firepower and can periodically use a fraction of it to blast your enemies. Once per day, you can cast <i>delayed blast fireball</i> as a spell-like ability.<br /><b>3: The Fieriest Fiend (Su)</b> Like the Ashen Bull you know that true power lies within Hell's hottest infernal flames, and you can call forth this fire to help you on Moloch's behalf in your struggles. For a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice, Malebolge's flames aid you and up to four allies within 30 feet of you. The flames encase affected creature's bodies, providing a +4 profane bonus to AC and immunity to fire. Anyone who strikes you or an affected ally with a melee attack takes 2d6 points of fire damage on each hit. Additionally, affected allies' melee, ranged, and natural weapons deal an additional 1d6 points of fire damage while this ability is in effect. Activating this ability is a standard action, and dismissing it is a free action. This effect's duration need not be used all at once, but it must be used in 1-round increments.</p><h3 class=\"framing\">Sentinel</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Book of the Damned pg. 80</i></a><br /><b>1: Citadel Defender (Sp)</b> <i>enlarge person </i> 3/day, <i>marching chant</i> 2/day, or <i>deadly juggernaut</i> 1/day<br /><b>2: Ashen Bull's Charge (Su)</b> When the mighty Ashen Bull charges his enemies in battle, all fall before him, quivering in fear and lamenting his rage. You can conjure the same terrifying power that Moloch commands when he bears down on his foes. Once per day as a standard action, with a sweep of your arm, you can emit a burst of infernal rage in a 30-foot radius centered on you. Up to four targets of your choice in the area must each succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be stunned for 1 round and staggered for another 3 rounds by the raw power of Hell. Creatures that succeed at this save are instead staggered for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.<br /><b>3: Cower before Hell's General (Su)</b> With the confidence of a chosen servant of Moloch-dutiful general of Malebolge, he who commands Hell's legions, and merciless destroyer of all that is good-you can strike mortal terror in the hearts of your enemies unlike any fear they have ever known. Twice per day as a standard action, you can invoke the names of the Lord of the Sixth. All enemies that can hear you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) or be panicked for a number of rounds equal to half your Hit Dice. On a successful saving throw, the affected creatures are merely shaken, but they also take a -4 penalty to their AC for the duration. This is not a language-dependent ability, but you must be able to speak to use it. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p><h2 class=\"title\">For Followers of Moloch</h2><p></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Feats</h3><p><a href=\"FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Hellish Shackles\">Hellish Shackles</a></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Magic Items - Wondrous Items</h3><p><a href=\"MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Molech\">Molech</a></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Traits</h3><p><a href=\"TraitDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Flames of Hell\">Flames of Hell</a></p><h2 class=\"title\">Unique Spell Rules</h2><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> <b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9jb9?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-105-The-Inferno-Gate\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Pathfinder #105: The Inferno Gate pg. 72</i></a><br /><p></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Cleric/Warpriest</h3><p><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Pyrotechnics\">Pyrotechnics</a></i> can be prepared as a 2nd-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Flame Arrow\">Flame Arrow</a></i> can be prepared as a 3rd-level spell<br /></p><h2 class=\"title\">Unique Summon Rules</h2><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9jb9?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-105-The-Inferno-Gate\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Pathfinder #105: The Inferno Gate pg. 73</i></a><br /><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Summon Monster 3\"><b>Summon Monster III</b></a>: <a href=\"MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Guardian Phantom Armor\">Phantom Armor (Guardian)</a> - LE<br /><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Summon Monster 6\"><b>Summon Monster VI</b></a>: <a href=\"MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Warmonger Devil (Levaloch)\">Warmonger Devil (Levaloch)</a><br /><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Summon Monster 8\"><b>Summon Monster VIII</b></a>: <a href=\"MonsterDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Tophet\">Tophet</a><br /><br /><p></p><div style=\"position:relative;left:0%;border:2px ridge #434343;width:100%;height:100%\"><div class=\"wiki-content-full\"><iframe style=\"overflow-y:hidden;width:100%;height:450px\" src=\"https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Moloch\"> </iframe></div>\n </div>",
