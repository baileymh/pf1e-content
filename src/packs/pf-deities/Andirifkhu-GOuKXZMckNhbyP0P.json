In addition, whenever you deal sneak attack damage, you can have all damage dealt by the attack become nonlethal damage. If you deal nonlethal damage this way to a creature that is unaware of your presence, the creature is unaware it has been attacked or has taken damage (instead experiencing a sense of unexplained weariness or weakness).<br /><b>3: Unreal Legion (Su)</b> Once per day, you can create three illusory copies of yourself. These copies are semireal; each uses your saving throws, has an Armor Class equal to your touch AC, and has hit points equal to one-quarter your maximum hit points. The copies move as you mentally direct them (a free action) and can be instructed to attack, although they always miss (the copies can provide flanking, however). When you cast a spell or use an ability, you can have the copies appear to cast that spell or use that ability simultaneously; if the effect has an obvious point of origin, you can have it appear to originate from all copies simultaneously. As an immediate action, you can switch places with one of the copies. If a copy is ever more than 60 feet from you, leaves your line of sight, or is reduced to 0 hit points, it immediately ceases to exist; otherwise, the copies last 24 hours or until you use this ability again, whichever comes first.</p><h3 class=\"framing\">Exalted</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Book of the Damned pg. 16</i></a><br /><b>1: Sadist's Trick (Sp)</b> <i>magic weapon </i> 3/day, <i>phantom trap</i> 2/day, or <i>snare</i> 1/day<br /><b>2: Deeper Cuts (Ex)</b> When you damage a creature with a slashing weapon or an effect that deals slashing damage, you can also deal 5 points of bleed damage.<br /><b>3: Andirifkhu's Kiss (Sp)</b> Once per day, you can cast empowered <i>blade barrier</i> as a spell-like ability.

Three times per day as a full-round action, you can conjure a trap into being in a square or squares within 30 feet. The trap must have a CR equal to or less than half your Hit Dice, and the environment must be able to support it (for example, a falling block trap must have a ceiling to fall from). The appropriate triggers for the trap, such as pressure plates or divination spells, are added to the environment in the fashion of your choosing. A trap conjured this way vanishes after 24 hours, when it is disabled, or after it is triggered and its effects have been resolved.<br /><b>3: Killing Machine (Su)</b> Once per day as a full-round action, you can transform yourself into a trap. The trap must have a CR equal to or less than your total Hit Dice (maximum CR 20), and the environment must be able to support your new form. When your trap form is triggered, or when a creature attempts to disable your trap form, you can instantaneously return to your normal form (appearing in the square or squares targeted by your trap form). This occurs after the trap has finished triggering and its effects are resolved (if appropriate), and it causes a surprise round in which only you and those who were aware of your true nature may act. This transformation otherwise lasts for 24 hours or until you dismiss it as a full-round action. This is a polymorph effect.</p><h2 class=\"title\">For Followers of Andirifkhu</h2><p></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Feats</h3><p><a href=\"FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Channel Discord\">Channel Discord</a></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Magic Items - Wondrous Items</h3><p><a href=\"MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Dagon's Eye\">Dagon's Eye</a></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Traits</h3><p><a href=\"TraitDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Demonic Persuasion\">Demonic Persuasion</a><br /><br /></p><div style=\"position:relative;left:0%;border:2px ridge #434343;width:100%;height:100%\"><div class=\"wiki-content-full\"><iframe style=\"overflow-y:hidden;width:100%;height:450px\" src=\"https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Andirifkhu\"> </iframe></div>\n </div>",
