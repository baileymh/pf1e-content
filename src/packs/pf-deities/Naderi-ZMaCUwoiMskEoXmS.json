Stand beside a river and cut the blossoms from the stems, then set them on the water to float downstream. Meditate upon the beautiful perfection of love and the imperfection of a life that would deny it to star-crossed lovers. You gain a +2 profane or sacred bonus on Charismabased skill checks. The type of bonus depends on your alignment-if you're neither good nor evil, you must choose either sacred or profane the first time you perform your obedience, and this choice can be changed.</p><h3 class=\"framing\">On Golarion</h3><p><b>Centers of Worship</b> Galt, Nidal, Taldor, Qadira, Ustalav<br /><b>Nationality</b> Taldan</p><h2 class=\"title\">Boons - <a href=\"FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Deific Obedience\">Deific Obedience</a></h2><p></p><h3 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> Evangelist</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j74?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Faiths\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Inner Sea Faiths pg. 77</i></a><br /><b>1: Watery Souls (Sp)</b> <i>wave shield</i><sup>ACG</sup> 3/day, <i>life pact</i><sup>ACG</sup> 2/day, or <i>water breathing</i> 1/day<br /><b>2: Depths of the Maelstrom (Su)</b> You do not fear death by water, for you are unafraid of your goddess's embrace, and you can capitalize on others' terror of the depths. Three times per day as an immediate action, when you step into any natural body of water, you can cause water within a 30-foot radius of where you stand to churn. You are unaffected by this churning. Any other creature wading or swimming in this water must attempt Swim checks as if the water were one category rougher; wading creatures must attempt DC 10 Swim checks, creatures swimming in calm water must make DC 15 Swim checks, creatures swimming in rough water must attempt DC 20 Swim checks, and creatures swimming in stormy water must attempt DC 25 Swim checks. If the water has a natural current, that current becomes fast moving. If the current was already fast moving, the DC of the Swim or Strength check to avoid going under increases to 15 + half your Hit Dice. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice or until you leave the water, whichever is first.<br /><b>3: Healing Waters (Su)</b> You have learned that the waters can take life, but also that they can give it. Three times per day, you can hold a creature underwater for a number of rounds equal to half your Hit Dice. Each round, as long as the creature is submerged and holding its breath, it is healed of 1d8 + 5 points of damage. If the creature doesn't hold its breath, it doesn't receive healing that round. If you submerge a creature and heal it for fewer rounds than half your Hit Dice, it still counts as one use of this ability.</p><h3 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> Exalted</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j74?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Faiths\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Inner Sea Faiths pg. 77</i></a><br /><b>1: No Rest for the Living (Sp)</b> <i>heightened awareness</i><sup>ACG</sup> 3/day, <i>compassionate ally</i><sup>UM</sup> 2/day, or <i>lover's vengeance</i><sup>ISWG</sup> 1/day<br /><b>2: Nothing Left to Lose (Su)</b> The losses you have suffered have made you morose and perhaps even aloof, but also fearless in battle. Once per day as a standard action, you may call out the name of a loved one you have lost. All opponents within hearing distance must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Wisdom modifier) or become shaken for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice. If you cause at least one creature to become shaken in this way, you gain a +2 profane or sacred bonus (of the same type as that provided by your obedience) on saving throws against spells with the mind-affecting descriptor for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice.<br /><b>3: Final Strike (Sp)</b> You can call down your goddess's cleansing wrath upon your wretched enemies. Three times per day as a standard action, you can cause a great column of white light to pour from the heavens that acts as a fireball, except the damage is force damage. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC = 13 + your Wisdom modifier) halves this damage.</p><h3 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> Sentinel</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j74?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Faiths\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Inner Sea Faiths pg. 77</i></a><br /><b>1: Frozen Despair (Sp)</b> <i>icicle dagger</i><sup>UM</sup> 3/day, <i>castigate</i><sup>APG</sup> 2/day, or <i>howling agony</i><sup>UM</sup> 1/day<br /><b>2: All Who Live Suffer Loss (Su)</b> You channel the despair and grief you have suffered into a cloud of sadness that saps the will of those who oppose you. All foes within a 30-foot, cone-shaped burst are staggered for a number of rounds equal to your Hit Dice, and take a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls. A successful Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier) negates this effect.<br /><b>3: Mantle of Tragic Grace (Sp)</b> You drape yourself in tragic glamor, and your longing for rest puts you beyond the reach of mortal harm for a lingering moment. As a standard action, you can activate this mantle, which acts as a <i>globe of invulnerability</i>. You may use this ability for a number of rounds each day equal to your Hit Dice. These rounds do not need to be consecutive, and you can dismiss this effect as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><h2 class=\"title\">For Followers of Naderi</h2><p></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Magic Items - Wondrous Items</h3><p><a href=\"MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Hero's Release Pendant\">Hero's Release Pendant</a></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Traits</h3><p><a href=\"TraitDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Empty Heart, Full Heart\">Empty Heart, Full Heart</a></p><h2 class=\"title\">Unique Spell Rules</h2><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> <b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9j74?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Inner-Sea-Faiths\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Inner Sea Faiths pg. 80</i></a><br /><p></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Cleric/Warpriest</h3><p><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Confusion, Lesser\">Confusion, Lesser</a></i> can be prepared as a 1st-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Crushing Despair\">Crushing Despair</a></i> can be prepared as a 3rd-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Suffocation\">Suffocation</a></i> can be prepared as a 5th-level spell<br /></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Inquisitor</h3><p><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Confusion, Lesser\">Confusion, Lesser</a></i> can be prepared as a 1st-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Crushing Despair\">Crushing Despair</a></i> can be prepared as a 3rd-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Suffocation\">Suffocation</a></i> can be prepared as a 5th-level spell<br /><br /></p><div style=\"position:relative;left:0%;border:2px ridge #434343;width:100%;height:100%\"><div class=\"wiki-content-full\"><iframe style=\"overflow-y:hidden;width:100%;height:450px\" src=\"https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Naderi\"> </iframe></div>\n </div>",
