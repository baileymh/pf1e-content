If you make an attack with a melee weapon, you may activate this ability as a swift action as part of your attack, targeting the foe struck with the effect. This ability is the equivalent of a 7th-level spell.<br /><b>3: Call Forth the Spawn (Sp)</b> Thrice per day you may use <i>destruction </i>as a spell-like ability. The body of a creature slain by this ability immediately transforms into an ochre jelly under your mental control. Ochre jellies created by this ability melt away into noxious residue after 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Boons - <a href=\"FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Fiendish Obedience\">Fiendish Obedience</a></h2><p></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Evangelist</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Book of the Damned pg. 60</i></a><br /><b>1: Spreading Slime (Sp)</b> <i>corrosive touch </i> 3/day, <i>web</i> 2/day, or <i>stinking cloud</i> 1/day<br /><b>2: Deliquescent Blessing (Su and Sp)</b> The blessing of the Faceless Lord grants you a measure of kinship to jellies, oozes, and slimes. Unintelligent oozes never attack you, and intelligent oozes have an initial starting attitude of friendly toward you. You gain ooze empathy-this works like a druid's wild empathy (using your character level as your druid level), except only with oozes. You can use this ability to influence intelligent oozes as though using the Diplomacy skill. In addition, once per day, you can transform a creature's body into an ooze; this acts as per <i>baleful polymorph</i>, except that the target is transformed into an ooze. A creature of 3 Hit Dice or fewer becomes a gray ooze, one with 4-9 Hit Dice becomes a gelatinous cube or ochre jelly (chosen randomly), and a creature of 10 or more Hit Dice becomes a black pudding. The target's gear does not transform with it; any such items fall under or within the ooze's body, which may cause them to take damage or to be destroyed. If the ooze has the split ability, splitting the ooze creates one ooze that retains the creature's original identity (for the purpose of memories or restoring the creature) and one normal, mindless ooze.<br /><b>3: Faceless Form (Ex)</b> Your form twists into a reflection of Jubilex's own shapeless appearance-your flesh becomes translucent emerald slime, your skin takes on a nauseating glistening sheen, and ogling crimson eyes sprout across your body. You gain the amorphous, all-around vision, and compression universal monster abilities. Your body still retains enough rigidity that you can speak, wield objects and weapons, and wear items like armor. In addition, if you have a hand free and not covered by a glove, you can make a touch attack as a standard action; on a hit, the touched creature takes 4d6 points of acid damage.</p><h3 class=\"framing\">Exalted</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Book of the Damned pg. 60</i></a><br /><b>1: Sign of the Faceless Lord (Sp)</b> <i>grease</i> 3/day, <i>delay poison</i> 2/day, or <i>slow</i> 1/day<br /><b>2: Poisonous Touch (Sp)</b> Just as the Faceless Lord's touch carries within it all manner of virulent toxins, so can you cause your flesh to exude deadly poison. Up to three times per day, you can cast <i>poison</i> as a spell-like ability. If you make an attack with a melee weapon, you can activate this ability as a swift action as part of your attack, targeting the foe struck.<br /><b>3: Call Forth the Spawn (Sp)</b> Three times per day, you can cast <i>destruction</i> as a spell-like ability. The body of a creature slain by this ability immediately transforms into an ochre jelly under your mental control. Ochre jellies created by this ability melt away into noxious residue after 1 hour.</p><h3 class=\"framing\">Sentinel</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Book of the Damned pg. 60</i></a><br /><b>1: Toxification (Sp)</b> <i>ray of sickening </i> 3/day, <i>pernicious poison</i> 2/day, or <i>eruptive pustules</i> 1/day<br /><b>2: Abyssal Humors (Ex and Su)</b> The sickness of the Undersump has infused your flesh, and you spread its horror with every crushing blow. You gain immunity to poison. Three times per day, as a swift action, you can exude a poison worth up to 50 gp per character level you have. This poison remains potent for 1 hour before turning to gritty dust. You can apply this poison to a weapon you wield as part of exuding it, deliver it as a contact poison with a touch, exhale it as an inhaled poison into an adjacent creature's face, or otherwise use this poison as you choose.<br /><b>3: Roiling Mind (Su)</b> Your mind becomes the churning blankness of a mindless ooze, thick with a psychic toxin that poisons those who reach inside. You gain immunity to mind-affecting effects.</p><h2 class=\"title\">For Followers of Jubilex</h2><p></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Feats</h3><p><a href=\"FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Channel Discord\">Channel Discord</a></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Magic Items - Wondrous Items</h3><p><a href=\"MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Dagon's Eye\">Dagon's Eye</a></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Traits</h3><p><a href=\"TraitDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Demonic Persuasion\">Demonic Persuasion</a><br /><br /></p><div style=\"position:relative;left:0%;border:2px ridge #434343;width:100%;height:100%\"><div class=\"wiki-content-full\"><iframe style=\"overflow-y:hidden;width:100%;height:450px\" src=\"https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Jubilex\"> </iframe></div>\n </div>",
