Mind-affecting spells you cast that would normally grant an additional saving throw or a bonus on saving throws for opposing the target's nature do not grant these bonuses or saves, as long as the intended course of action is lurid or perverse (such as causing a druid to lust after her animal companion, or a brother and sister to lust after one another). In addition, three times per day, you can cast quickened <i>unnatural lust</i> as a spell-like ability.<br /><b>3: Perverse Reshaping (Sp)</b> Your deeply felt prayers and obsessive devotion to the secrets Socothbenoth whispers to you when you sleep have granted you the ability to reshape matter and grant life where life should perhaps not exist. Three times per day, you can cast <i>polymorph any object</i> as a spell-like ability. Unlike with the spell, you are not limited to existing forms; you could turn the target into a three-headed nymph or a centaur-like creature made only of human body parts, for example (although this does not apply to inanimate forms, such as turning a human into a sculpture of soft clay or vice versa). You can also perform partial transformations, such as granting additional body parts, changing a creature's limbs into something else, or transforming only a creature's tongue into a tentacle. If the resulting form would be lethal, the target gains a +4 bonus on the save. Unlike for a normal <i>polymorph any object</i> spell, changes you make this way can be undone only by a <i>wish</i> or <i>miracle</i> spell or by another use of this ability.</p><h3 class=\"framing\">Exalted</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Book of the Damned pg. 94</i></a><br /><b>1: Sins of the Flesh (Sp)</b> <i>charm person </i> 3/day, <i>eagle's splendor</i> 2/day, or <i>beast shape I</i> 1/day<br /><b>2: Compelling Voice (Su)</b> You have honed your voice into a weapon, and can speak in a smooth and seductive tone that slips into the minds of those who listen like the lightest brush of a lover's breath. As a result, your mind-affecting effects become harder to resist. Increase the save DC of such effects you create by 1, or by 2 when used against an intelligent creature that is or could be sexually attracted to you.<br /><b>3: Truth in the Flesh (Sp)</b> The raptures of physical pleasure grow old when you throw taboo to the wind, and so you have honed your faith to emulate your sinful patron's fluidity of the flesh. You can cast <i>shapechange</i> once per day as a spell-like ability.</p><h3 class=\"framing\">Sentinel</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9tok\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Book of the Damned pg. 94</i></a><br /><b>1: Before The Fall (Sp)</b> <i>delusional pride </i> 3/day, <i>mirror image</i> 2/day, or <i>heroism</i> 1/day<br /><b>2: Violent Vice (Ex)</b> Causing harm to others fills you with a euphoric pleasure that allows you to endure the harshest blows. Up to three times per day as you deal hit point damage to a creature, the rush of pleasure grants you temporary hit points equal to twice your Charisma modifier. These temporary hit points stack with multiple uses of this ability (but not with temporary hit points from other sources), and last for 1 minute or until depleted. As long as you are fully healed and have at least one of these temporary hit points, you gain a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls and Will saving throws.<br /><b>3: Sensuous Facade (Su)</b> Your form has achieved the utmost perfection, granting you a measure of protection and filling you with a surge of prideful wrath whenever your beauty would be sullied by others' assaults. Your physical appearance becomes darkly beautiful and sexually appealing, granting you a +2 profane bonus to your Charisma score. As long as you do not have an armor bonus to your Armor Class, you gain a profane bonus to your AC and on Fortitude saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier. Whenever a creature deals damage to you with an attack, you gain a profane bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on your next weapon attack roll against that creature.</p><h2 class=\"title\">For Followers of Socothbenoth</h2><p></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Feats</h3><p><a href=\"FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Channel Discord\">Channel Discord</a></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Magic Items - Wondrous Items</h3><p><a href=\"MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Dagon's Eye\">Dagon's Eye</a></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Traits</h3><p><a href=\"TraitDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Demonic Persuasion\">Demonic Persuasion</a><br /><br /></p><div style=\"position:relative;left:0%;border:2px ridge #434343;width:100%;height:100%\"><div class=\"wiki-content-full\"><iframe style=\"overflow-y:hidden;width:100%;height:450px\" src=\"https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Socothbenoth\"> </iframe></div>\n </div>",
