If you and your allies are fortunate enough that no such malady is currently a challenge, read and recite passages from She of Grace and Might to remind yourselves of your goals and aspirations for the day. If you are traveling alone, find others to speak to about the beneficial strengths of community and freedom to develop that community into a more positive place. Guide any arguments during this discussion toward understanding and acceptance, even if afterward not all parties agree on the final resolution.

Once per day as a standard action, you can cast either <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=break enchantment\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>break enchantment</i></a> or <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=freedom of movement\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>freedom of movement</i></a> as a spell-like ability targeting one of your allies within 300 feet whom you can perceive. The spell has a caster level equal to your character level.<br /><b>3: Shared Expertise (Su)</b> You know that your bond to your allies is your greatest benefit. Each time you complete your obedience, you can select a bonus <a href=\"Feats.aspx?Category=Teamwork\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\">teamwork feat</a>. You must meet the prerequisites for this feat. All of your allies are treated as if they possessed the same teamwork feat as you for the purpose of determining whether you receive the benefit of the teamwork feat.

Three times per day as a standard action, you can summon a mystical glowing shield that sheds light as a torch.

Creatures within the space can see the environs outside of the space, but those outside cannot see inside. Within the refuge is a bountiful table set with as many chairs as the number of creatures invited in, and the table holds a delicious feast that acts as the <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=heroes' feast\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>heroes' feast</i></a> spell with a caster level equal to your Hit Dice.</p><h3 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> Sentinel</h3><p><b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01vao\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Faiths of Golarion pg. 29</i></a><br /><b>1: Dedicated Might (Sp)</b> <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=true strike\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>true strike</i></a> 3/day, <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=bull's strength\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>bull's strength</i></a> 2/day, or <a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=heroism\" style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><i>heroism</i></a> 1/day<br /><b>2: Caring Defender (Su)</b> Protection of self and community is paramount to you.

Kazutal's paladins prefer friendship to violence, but they never back down from their responsibility to stand up for those weaker than themselves or those they consider under their protection. Their tenets include the following affirmations. <ul><li>Bonds are what give our society strength. Though families and communities are complex and ever changing, I will focus to maintain the positive connections with my own family and community, and encourage others to do the same. </li><li>No law, price, or justification can legitimize slavery. I will free slaves where I find them and will never enslave another creature to act against its own will. </li><li>Conquest is destruction. I will always fight to defend others from violent subjugation, and no tyrant will ever receive my deference. </li><li>I understand that failure is expected, and that my life belongs to more than myself. If I give my life for others, I do so fully respecting its worth, and I will do my best to prevent others from committing pointless sacrifices. </li><li>Love is the province of the brave. If I value something, I must not hide my feelings. I will show the world my love by protecting that which I cherish. My example lends my strength to those who share my love but fear to act. </li><li>I will defend liberty, even when it challenges established community and family standards. Those who are true to themselves forge the strongest relationships with others, and I must protect them so long as they do no harm and do not infringe on others' liberty in turn.</li></ul><h2 class=\"title\">Unique Spell Rules</h2><img src=\"http://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px\" title=\"PFS Legal\" /> <b>Source </b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://paizo.com/products/btq01vao\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Faiths of Golarion pg. 31</i></a><br /><p></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Cleric/Warpriest</h3><p><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Beast Shape I\">Beast Shape I</a></i> can be prepared as a 3rd-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Beast Shape II\">Beast Shape II</a></i> can be prepared as a 4th-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Beast Shape III\">Beast Shape III</a></i> can be prepared as a 5th-level spell<br /></p><h3 class=\"framing\">Paladin</h3><p><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Blessing of Fervor\">Blessing of Fervor</a></i> can be prepared as a 4th-level spell<br /><i><a href=\"SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Freedom of Movement\">Freedom of Movement</a></i> can be prepared as a 4th-level spell<br /><br /></p><div style=\"position:relative;left:0%;border:2px ridge #434343;width:100%;height:100%\"><div class=\"wiki-content-full\"><iframe style=\"overflow-y:hidden;width:100%;height:450px\" src=\"https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Kazutal\"> </iframe></div>\n </div>",
