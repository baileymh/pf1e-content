      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Suli&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Elemental Assault&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A suli with this racial trait has a stronger connection to one energy type than to the other three used by sulis. Choose one energy type: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. The suli's elemental assault ability can only deal energy damage of this type. The suli has resistance 5 to this energy type and no racial resistance to the other three types. While her elemental assault is active, the suli gains an additional ability based on the chosen energy type. <br /><br />  <i>Earthfoot (acid)</i>: Whenever the suli moves through difficult terrain related to earth and stone (rubble, mud, sand, and so on), she may move through 5 feet of that difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. This allows the suli to take a 5-foot step into that difficult terrain. Other kinds of difficult terrain (ice, caltrops, foliage, and so on) affect the suli normally. <br /><br /> <i>Firehand (fire)</i>: Instead of adding damage to a melee attack, the suli may hurl a piece of her arm-flames as if it were a thrown weapon. The suli makes a ranged touch attack; if the attack hits, the target takes 1d6 points of fire damage. The flames have a range increment of 10 feet. <br /><br /> <i>Icewalk (cold)</i>: The suli can walk on water-based liquids as if using <i>water walk</i>, except instead of hovering above the surface, she creates a temporary layer of ice that supports her and immediately melts once she moves away from it. This ice is not slippery to the suli and does not affect her balance or speed, though other ice affects her normally. Other creatures cannot travel on this ice, but the suli may carry a creature while moving. <br /><br /> <i>Shockshield (electricity)</i>: Once per round as an immediate action, the suli can shock a creature that touches or attacks her with a natural attack, unarmed strike, or metal melee weapon, dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage to the creature. <br /><br /> This racial trait otherwise works like and replaces elemental assault. </p>",
