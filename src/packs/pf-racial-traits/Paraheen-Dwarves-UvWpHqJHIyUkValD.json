      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Dwarf&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Paraheen are a small but important part of the society of Katheer, where they operate numerous forges and weapon shops within the city. Not quite a clan, the Paraheen are a set of related, family-run businesses respected for their great craftsmanship and work ethic. While most Paraheen are not citizens of Qadira, they are treated as a valued subclass of residents, with enough powerful patrons among the upper ranks of Qadiran society to afford them protection that in some cases is greater than citizenship. The Paraheen have operated as an autonomous community for centuries, avoiding local politics and worshiping a combination of traditional dwarven gods and an aspect of Sarenrae who is aligned with the fire of the forge. Nearly all Paraheen have the craftsman alternate racial trait, but in the case of the Paraheen, it replaces hardy rather than greed. Those Paraheen who are involved in trade by river and sea, common in Katheer, also generally have the saltbeard alternate racial trait. Most Paraheen from older families tend to have the iron citizen alternate racial trait described below.</p>",
