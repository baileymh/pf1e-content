      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Half-Orc&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, the few remaining orc tribes have been largely cut off from others of their kind. Isolated since the orc empires collapsed after the Age of Darkness, only a handful of oral retellings recall the true heritage of these orcs and half-orcs, and their culture diverges greatly from other orc societies. It is said that some early Mwangi tribes participated in arranged marriages with orcs, leading half-orc children to be associated with alliances and prosperity, and true or not, half-orcs have been a major part of these orc tribes for generations. Even in the present day, many orcs are willing to pay a large dowry to bring half-orcs into their villages, and orphaned half-orcs are happily adopted.<br /><br /> Because they usually come from rich families, rainkin halforcs often receive better treatment than their orc or human cousins. This can create a self-fulfilling prophecy; because half-orc children receive the best care, protection, and training, they are usually stronger and more skilled than orcs or humans, increasing the desire to have half-orcs in a tribe. While jungle half-orcs typically have great pride and selfworth, many are also resentful of the high expectations placed on them from birth and angry to be treated like a commodity by so many. As a result, rainkin have trouble forming close bonds with non-half-orcs, so they often create close-knit groups between themselves. Some of these groups even grow large enough to break off and form their own tribes.</p>",
