      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Half-Orc&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>At the Crown of the World, nomadic clans of orcs live on the frozen wastes. The winter half-orcs that live among them are treated as the runts of the pack. However, strength in numbers is vital in the north, as many young do not survive the harsh winters. Even the weakest are provided for as long as they can prove their usefulness. Sewing, cooking, and child-rearing are all valued skills, and winter half-orcs who excel at these are treated better than most. Those who would rather prove their worth through their strength do so by hunting, as ritual combat is a frowned upon waste of energy and resources.<br /><br /> While half-orcs are not well liked in the Linnorm Kingdoms, they may be able to find homes in the Ironbound Isles. Merchants traveling between Tian Xia and Avistan are often willing to hire on a half-orc as a guide and bodyguard across the Crown of the World. Winter half-orcs who migrate south into Irrisen can find an easier life in the growing half-orc communities, but they are unlikely to find any upward mobility unless they show skill at witchcraft.</p>",
