      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Elf&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Keen Senses&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The character has a mystic connection to one terrain type, selected from the ranger's favored terrain list. The character selects three 0-level druid spells and one 1st-level druid spell. If the character has a Charisma score of 11 or higher, when in the selected terrain, she gains these spells as spell-like abilities that can be cast once per day. The caster level for these effects is equal to the user's character level. The DC for the spelllike abilities is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the user's Charisma modifier. These spells are treated as being from a fey source for the purposes of the druid's resist nature's lure class feature and similar abilities.<br /><br /> A dwarf can take this trait in place of greed and stonecunning. An elf, half-elf, or half ling can take this trait in place of keen senses. A gnome can take this trait in place of obsessive. A half-orc can take it in place of orc ferocity. A human can take it in place of skilled. A human who replaces skilled with fey magic also gains fey thoughts and low-light vision.</p>",
