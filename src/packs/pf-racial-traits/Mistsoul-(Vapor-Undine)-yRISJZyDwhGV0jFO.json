      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Undine&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Soothing and insightful, mistsoul undines move through the world with airy resilience and earnest action. <br /><br /> <b>Typical Alignment</b> NG <br /><b>Ability Modifiers</b> +2 Con, +2 Wis, ï¿½2 Int <br /><b>Alternate Spell-Like Ability</b> Mistsouls gain <%SPELLS%obscuring mist%%><i>obscuring mist</i><%END> as a spell-like ability. <br /><b>Mist Affinity</b> This racial trait functions as and can be replaced as the base undine's water affinity, except it benefits sorcerers with the dreamspun bloodline and spellcasters with the Repose domain.<br /><br /> With gentle spirits and contemplative minds, mistsouls are drawn to the more mystic aspects of their element. Their ephemeral, vaporous natures can allow them to lull others into a dreamlike state, or facilitate a peaceful transition into the next life. They tend to seek out places where ideological and political struggles converge, and thus they are at home in communities like those of the common folk of Brevoy.<br /><br /> Physically, mistsouls have rounded features and graceful deliberation in their movement. They prefer soft, highquality garments of neutral or earth tones and simple jewelry chosen for significance rather than expense.</p>",
