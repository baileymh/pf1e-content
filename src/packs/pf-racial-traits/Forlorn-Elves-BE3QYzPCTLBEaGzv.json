      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Elf&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Forlorn elves rarely refer to themselves by that name; instead, other elves use the term to refer to elves who reside among shorter-lived races. Forlorn elves often watch many of their friends and family die before their first century is past. Some Forlorn have adopted a variety of unhealthy coping mechanisms as a result, such as recklessness or substance abuse; others develop antisocial tendencies and keep others at arm's length to avoid the pain of loss. Still others learn to accept the brevity of the lives around them, cherishing what time they have with friends while they still have it.<br /><br /> Forlorn are the most common wanderers of elvenkind, whether they're traveling widely to avoid attachment or relishing travel with short-lived companions, and many become adventurers. Some find their way to elven lands, where their kin sympathetically welcome them, while others avoid such places out of bitterness or fear of rejection. Forlorn elves frequently have the envoy and urbanite alternate racial traits; some also have the devoted companion alternate racial trait described below.</p>",
