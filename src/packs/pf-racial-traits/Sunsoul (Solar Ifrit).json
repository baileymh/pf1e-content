      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Ifrit&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Strong in character and in body, sunsoul ifrits are incurably optimistic agents of positive change. <br /><br /> <b>Typical Alignment</b> LG <br /><b>Ability Modifiers</b> +2 Str, +2 Cha, ï¿½2 Wis <br /><b>Alternate Spell-Like Ability</b> Sunsouls gain <%SPELLS%sun metal%%><i>sun metal</i><%END> as a spell-like ability.<br /> <b>Solar Affinity</b> This racial trait functions as and can be replaced as the base ifrit's fire affinity, except it benefits sorcerers with the celestial bloodline and spellcasters with the Sun domain.<br /><br /> With fire comes light, and the brightness of the sunsouls comes both from their affinity for positive energy and their own luminous attitudes. Where others despair, they labor on, striving to lead by example. Strong leaders and passionate ethos attract sunsouls, drawing them toward powerful religions or crusading nations such as Mendev. They can also be found in places where darkness is settling in; both Taldor and Ustalav have their share of sunsouls working to return these nations to the light.<br /><br /> Sunsouls cannot easily hide their presence, and most would never try. Most sunsouls tend to have fair hair, often nearly white, and eyes that glow with a twinkle all their own. Some seem to glow from within, as if lit from inside by an inner sunlight. Unafraid to be seen, they dress in whatever styles please them, even when it means they stand out among populations either more daring or more conservative.</p>",
