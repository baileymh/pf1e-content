      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Tiefling&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Languages, Subtype, Type&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Discrimination against tief lings with horrifically fiendish features is so intense that even tieflings look up to those precious few of their kind who can pass as human. These tieflings have otherworldly features that are so subtle, they aren't often noticed unless the tiefling points them out (for example, eyes that flash red in the throes of passion, or fingernails that are naturally hard and pointed). Such a tiefling doesn't need to succeed at a Disguise check to appear to be human and count as humanoid (human) as well as outsider (native) for all purposes (such as humanoid-affecting spells like <i>charm person</i> or <i>enlarge person</i>). The tiefling does not automatically gain his associated outsider language (but may select it as a bonus language if his Intelligence score is high enough), and he may not select other racial traits that would grant him obviously fiendish features (such as the fiendish sprinter, maw or claw, prehensile tail, scaled skin, or vestigial wings alternate racial traits listed in the <i>Advanced Race Guide</i>). This ability alters the tiefling's type, subtype, and languages.</p>",
