      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Dwarf&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Pahmet have been present in Osirion since ancient days and claim to have been sent by the gods to warn the pharaohs of impending crises and disasters. Though most scholars suspect that claim is more legend than history, the ancient pharaohs of Osirion treated the Pahmet with great reverence. In return, the Pahmet guard Erekrus, a necropolis in the mountains of southern Osirion, where the Pahmet interred the bodies of pharaohs deemed particularly worthy. The Pahmet are a rigid and often mistrusting people; it is common for its members who avoid contact with outsiders to have the xenophobic alternate racial trait. Many Pahmet have the lorekeeper, mountaineer, rock stepper, and surface survivalist alternate racial traits. Those who come from long lines of keepers who dedicate themselves to the guarding of tombs also often have the death's end alternate racial trait described below.</p>",
