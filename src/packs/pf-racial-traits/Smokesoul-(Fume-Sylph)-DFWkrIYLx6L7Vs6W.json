      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Sylph&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Veiled and surreptitious, smokesoul sylphs are natural deceivers, always concealing their true intentions. <br /><br /> <b>Typical Alignment</b> CE <br /><b>Ability Modifiers</b> +2 Dex, +2 Cha, ï¿½2 Con <br /><b>Alternate Spell-Like Ability</b> Smokesouls gain <%SPELLS%blurred movement%%><i>blurred movement</i><%END> as a spell-like ability. <br /><b>Smoke Affinity</b> This racial trait functions as and can be replaced as the base sylph's air affinity, except it benefits sorcerers with the shadow bloodline and spellcasters with the Smoke subdomain.<br /><br /> Obfuscation, secrecy, and the shape of things not there: all these are the natural realms of smokesouls. They are experts at concealing both their bodies and motivations, and at making the insubstantial seem as real as any physical object. Smokesouls are drawn to areas of dangerous politics and intrigue, and many can be found in Nidal and Brevoy pursuing whatever machinations amuse them.<br /><br /> With few distinguishing features save ashen skin and dark hair, smokesouls can be mistaken for any number of other races. Smokesouls often change their clothing, cosmetics, or style to keep their appearance in a constant state of flux.</p>",
