      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Elf&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Aquatic elves are the oceanic cousins of landborn elves. These elves have developed gills and webbed fingers and toes that allow them to survive and navigate the waters of Golarion, and often have blue, coral, or seaweed-black skin to blend into their environment. A significant number of aquatic elves live in the Steaming Sea near Mordant Spire, and in the Arcadian Ocean. Aquatic elves typically live secluded lives, either on their own or in small communities, though groups of aquatic elves that interact with land-dwelling communities are not uncommon. These elves are as varied as their land-dwelling kin, with unique cultures and customs scattered throughout the oceans and seas of Golarion. Aquatic elves often have the aquatic mastery alternate racial trait described below.</p>",
