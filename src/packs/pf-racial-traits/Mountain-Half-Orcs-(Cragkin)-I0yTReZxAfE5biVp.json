      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Half-Orc&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Cragkin are widespread across Golarion, found across all the mountain ranges of western Avistan. Thanks to their thin frames and quick wits, mountain-born half-orcs excel at climbing and acrobatic stunts. Anything less than a vertical cliff face is traversable, and often even that isn't enough to stop them. To mountain half-orcs, obstacles are merely a foothold on their path to the top.<br /><br /> Mountain orcs respect bravery, and cragkin have turned fearlessness and reckless abandon into a badge of honor. By using the terrain to their advantage against less surefooted enemies, they can attack from strange angles and gain advantages with just a few quick steps. They often take near-suicidal leaps to strike enemies from above, or trick enemies into falling to their deaths by leading them down impossible paths. Despite their great skill, accidents are common in this treacherous environment, and no one is surprised if one halforc returns after a raid and his companions do not.<br /><br /> Many mountain half-orcs find a place among Shoanti and Ulfen settlements, where valor in battle is highly prized. As long as they are willing to respect the traditions of their adopted clans, they usually integrate well into these societies and contribute much to the community.</p>",
