      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Elf&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Snowcaster tribes of the far north are extraordinarily reclusive, hiding their settlements in icy caverns, mountain valleys, the hearts of snow-shrouded pine forests, and other difficult-to-reach places. Their loyalty to their homes borders on religious reverence, whether they are ancestral burial grounds, ancient elven ruins, or simply places they've chosen as their own. Snowcasters rarely journey outside their homes or meet with outsiders. The primary exceptions to this are the twilight speakers, who serve as emissaries to the outside world. Less commonly, Snowcasters who have been exiled, who have lost their homes to monsters, or who are simply overcome with wanderlust may journey to the outside world to seek a new life.<br /><br /> Snowcasters frequently have the desert runner, elemental resistance (cold), and fleet-footed alternate racial traits; a few have the frostmelding alternate racial trait described below.</p>",
