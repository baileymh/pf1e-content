      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Dwarf&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In southern peaks of the Shattered Range, near Geb and the Screaming Jungle, clans of nomadic dwarves live and travel through ancient tunnels by day, moving to the surface only at night. Though there are no known dwarven cities in this region, the Garundi dwarves claim the extensive tunnels and caverns they move through are the remains of a once=powerful dwarven kingdom, which was struck down by the gods for some long-forgotten offense. These dwarves travel in caravans of 40 or so family units (though the largest caravans can contain more than 300 families) and engage in sporadic clan-based trade or warfare, but they all respect the neutrality of hidden settlements of dwarves who dwell in underground oases within the mountains. Desert dwarves often have the craftsman, mountaineer, and rock stepper alternate racial traits. Most also have the desert delver alternate racial trait described below.</p>",
