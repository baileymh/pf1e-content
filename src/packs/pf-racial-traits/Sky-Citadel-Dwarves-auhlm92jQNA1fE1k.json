      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Dwarf&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When the dwarves successfully completed the Quest for Sky, they set about constructing 10 Sky Citadels, massive fortresses that formed the basis for dwarven kingdoms in the Inner Sea region. While several of those Sky Citadels have been lost or overrun, a few�such as Highhelm, Janderhoff, and Dongun Hold�remain bastions of dwarven tradition and authority. Because these Sky Citadels often have connections to the Darklands, it is common for the dwarves dwelling in their lower reaches to have the ancient enmity or deep warrior alternate racial traits, while those in lands populated by ogres and hill giants often have the giant hunter alternate racial trait, and those in wealthy areas that attract the attention of dragons sometimes have the sky sentinel or wyrmscourged alternate racial traits. Because of the eon-long histories of the Sky Citadels, their citizens also often have the deep tradition alternate racial trait described below.</p>",
