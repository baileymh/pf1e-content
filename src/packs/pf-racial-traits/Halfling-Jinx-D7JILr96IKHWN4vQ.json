      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Halfling&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Halfling Luck&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You lose the halfling luck racial trait (and its +1 racial bonus on saving throws) and instead gain the ability to curse another creature with bad luck at will as a standard action. This curse has a range of 30 feet, and you must be able to see the target and have line of effect to it. The target gets a Will saving throw to resist this jinx (DC = 10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modifier). If your target makes this saving throw, it is immune to your jinx ability for 24 hours. A jinxed creature takes a ï¿½1 penalty on all saving throws. This jinx lasts for 24 hours or until you attempt to use your jinx again. A jinx is a supernatural ability, is not mind-affecting, does not allow spell resistance, and can affect any kind of creature not immune to luck effects.<br /><br /><i>From Halflings of Golarion, pg. 26, relating to all the Halfling Jinx feats. - Nethys</i><br />Only halflings may select the Halfling Jinx trait. All but one of the feats in this article require the Halfling Jinx racial trait as a prerequisite. A halfling jinx wizard can select these feats using his class bonus feats as long as he meets all the prerequisites. Many of these feats add to the effect of a halfling's jinx; unless otherwise stated, the feat's effect is in addition to the basic jinx's penalty on saving throws. For example, a halfling with the Alchemical Obstruction feat creates jinxes that penalize saving throws and interfere with alchemical items. A halfling can select the Ability Focus monster feat (see page 314 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i>) to increase the DC of his jinx.</p>",
