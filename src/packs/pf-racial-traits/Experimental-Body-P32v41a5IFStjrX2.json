Choose one of the following abilities. <br /><br /><i>Blessed</i>: These wyrwoods contain divine relics. Wyrwoods with this trait can use <%SPELLS%divine favor%%><i>divine favor</i><%END> once per day as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to their Hit Dice. <br /><br /><i>Enchanted</i>: Crafted from the remnants of broken staves, wands and other items, these wyrwoods have a natural attunement to the arcane. Wyrwoods with this trait treat their Intelligence score as 2 higher for the purpose of determining bonus spells or extracts per day. <br /><br /><i>Fey-Touched</i>: These wyrwoods have components that create a powerful link to the First World. Wyrwoods with this trait can use <%SPELLS%charm animal%%><i>charm animal</i><%END> once per day as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to their Hit Dice. <br /><br /><i>Scorched</i>: These wyrwoods are built from the ruins of cities and structures destroyed by conflict. Once per day, after a successful melee attack against an enemy, wyrwoods with this trait can deal an additional number of points of damage equal to their Wisdom modifier as a free action. <br /><br />This replaces darkvision and low-light vision.</p>",
