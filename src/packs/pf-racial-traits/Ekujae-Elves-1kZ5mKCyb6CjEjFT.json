      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Elf&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Though the Ekujae clans are often mistaken for unaffiliated tribes, they are in fact a united nation and still hold vestiges of the power that their ancient kingdom once wielded. Ekujae elves reside within the Mwangi Expanse in hidden jungle villages so interwoven with the surrounding trees that the buildings there are overlooked even by travelers passing within a few hundred feet them. Unlike many of the elves of Avistan, the Ekujae remained on Golarion despite the calamity of Earthfall and tell tales of having defeated a �Great Darkness� after the disaster. They still hone their skills for war and are ever ready to fight the Darkness if it returns. Due to this ancient responsibility, Ekujae hold to strict traditions in many matters, including the burying of their fallen and the act of swearing oaths and ritualized agreements.<br /><br /> Like other elves, Ekujae have keen intellects and are skilled in magical lore, including what has been passed down through their oral traditions and the numerous secrets of the Mwangi Expanse. They often journey to the Magaambya to study magic or to share their knowledge with that academy's students. Ekujae frequently have the long-limbed alternate racial trait and either the woodcraft, silent hunter, or light against darkness alternate racial traits, as well as the sense thoughts alternate racial trait described below.</p>",
