      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Drow&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Drow Immunities, Light Blindness, Spell Resistance, Weapon Familiarity&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Drow sometimes augment their slaves and frontline warriors by making them toxic, causing their bodies to internally produce mawbane poison (see below). The resulting poisonous creature makes a potent weapon in the effort to discourage neighboring monsters. Any creature that hits such a character with a bite attack is immediately exposed to its poison. The save DC for this poison is equal to 10 + 1/2 the character's Hit Dice + the character's Constitution modifier.<br /><br /> <i>Mawbane Poison</i>ï¿½ingested; <i>save</i> Fortitude as above; <i>frequency</i> 1/round for 4 rounds; <i>effect</i> 1d2 Constitution damage; <i>cure</i> 1 save.<br /><br /> Dwarves can take this trait in place of defensive training and hardy. Elves can take this trait in place of elven magic and weapon familiarity. Gnomes can take this trait in place of defensive training, gnome magic, and illusion resistance. Half-elves can take this trait in place of elven immunities and keen senses. Half-orcs can take this trait in place of orc ferocity and weapon familiarity. Humans can take this trait in place of skilled. Halfling physiology prevents them from taking this trait. Drow can take this trait in place of drow immunities, light blindness, spell resistance, and weapon familiarity. Wayangs can take this trait in place of light and dark, lurker, and shadow resistance.</p>",
