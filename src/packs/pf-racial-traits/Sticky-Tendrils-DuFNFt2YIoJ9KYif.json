      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Gathlain&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Racial Fly Speed&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When a gathlain seed finds itself taking root in an environment that warps and changes erratically, the resulting gathlain learns to cling tenaciously with its vines. The gathlain can cling to walls and even ceilings as long as the surface has handholds, and it is treated as being constantly under the effects of a nonmagical <i>spider climb</i> spell (except that the gathlain may not cling to smooth surfaces). The gathlain's vines provide only the ability to glide rather than true flight; the gathlain takes no damage from falling, as if subject to a constant nonmagical feather fall spell. While in midair, a gathlain can move up to 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it falls, at a speed of 60 feet per round. The gathlain cannot gain height with its wings, but instead coasts in other directions as it falls. If subjected to strong winds or any other effect that causes it to rise, the gathlain can take advantage of this updraft to increase the distance it can glide. This racial trait replaces the gathlain's fly speed.</p>",
