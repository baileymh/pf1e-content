      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Sylph&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>With an abundance of confidence and a shortage of patience, stormsoul sylphs are personalities who cannot be ignored. <br /><br /> <b>Typical Alignment</b> CN <br /><b>Ability Modifiers</b> +2 Dex, +2 Cha, ï¿½2 Wis <br /><b>Alternate Spell-Like Ability</b> Stormsouls gain <%SPELLS%shocking grasp%%><i>shocking grasp</i><%END> as a spell-like ability. <br /><b>Lightning Affinity</b> This racial trait functions as and can be replaced as the base sylph's air affinity, except it benefits sorcerers with the stormborn bloodline and spellcasters with the Weather domain.<br /><br /> When a stormsoul moves, either in word or in action, the world notices. Unafraid to speak their minds, they are both direct and unsubtle, and they make fierce allies. When friends are in need, stormsouls act without thinking and are always the first to leap to their aid.<br /><br /> A stormsoul sylph has hair that always seems to move, even when there is no breeze, and acts with a sudden intensity that can seem out of control. Their eyes are the color of stormy water or lightning-lit skies, and even a casual glance from a stormsoul can seem severe.</p>",
