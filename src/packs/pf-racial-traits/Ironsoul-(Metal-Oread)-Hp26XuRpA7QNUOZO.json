      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Oread&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Stolid and indomitable, ironsoul oreads undertake great works, both physical and conceptual, with unwavering determination. <br /><br /> <b>Typical Alignment</b> LN <br /><b>Ability Modifiers</b> +2 Con, +2 Wis, ï¿½2 Dex <br /><b>Alternate Spell-Like Ability</b> Ironsouls gain <%SPELLS%unerring weapon%%><i>unerring weapon</i><%END> as a spell-like ability. <br /><b>Metal Affinity</b> This racial trait functions as and can be replaced as the base oread's earth affinity, except it benefits sorcerers with the shaitan bloodline and spellcasters with the Metal subdomain.<br /><br /> Possessed of patience and a sense of self-refinement through struggle, ironsouls reflect their ancestry in their continuous and determined efforts towards self-improvement. Ironsouls are most at home in areas that reflect that same sense of directed and intentional growth, and they operate best within existing formal structures.<br /><br /> Ironsouls wear their elemental heritage on their skin, with most having some amount of metallic sheen. Their skin tone varies, with colors ranging from gold and silver to copper-green and dull, oxide gray.</p>",
