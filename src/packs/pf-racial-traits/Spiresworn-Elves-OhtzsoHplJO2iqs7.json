      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Elf&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Mordant Spire's elves, with their eerie masks and off-putting mannerisms, are a mystery to most Avistani. These elves have sworn to prevent exploration of Azlant in order to preserve and isolate the remnants of the Azlanti culture and protect Golarion from another Earthfall. The reclusive Spiresworn use enchantment and water magic to dissuade explorers; they resort to violent or deadly means only with utmost reluctance. In recent years, some younger Spiresworn have begun to question their isolationist traditions. While their commitment to protecting Azlant remains firm, a growing segment of Spiresworn believe that there is much to gain from interaction with the wider world. These elves sometimes leave the Spire to seek knowledge and experience.<br /><br /> Spiresworn frequently have the keeper of secrets alternate racial trait, as well as the crossbow training, natural swimmer, and tongue of the sea alternate racial traits; some also have the moonkissed alternate racial trait described below.</p>",
