      "value": "<p><strong>Race:</strong> Undine&nbsp;<br /><strong>Replaced Trait(s):</strong> Base Statistics&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rimesoul undines are distant and imperious, aloof in their intellect and hesitant to change their ways. <br /><br /> <b>Typical Alignment</b> LN <br /><b>Ability Modifiers</b> +2 Dex, +2 Int, ï¿½2 Cha <br /><b>Alternate Spell-Like Ability</b> Rimesouls gain <%SPELLS%chill touch%%><i>chill touch</i><%END> as a spell-like ability. <br /><b>Ice Affinity</b> This racial trait functions as and can be replaced as the base undine's water affinity, except it benefits sorcerers with the boreal bloodline and spellcasters with the Ice subdomain.<br /><br /> Like their ice-coated ancestors, rimesouls represent the solidification of change. They have precise, ordered minds that take well to individual pursuits. Rimesouls often choose to live in sparsely populated areas in Irrisen and Varisia. When they do live in cities, they prefer areas of disciplined culture such as Druma and Cheliax.<br /><br /> In appearance, rimesouls are frequently pale, sometimes with translucent or blue-tinged skin. Rimesouls usually dress in crisp, understated fashions that present an impression of austerity.</p>",
