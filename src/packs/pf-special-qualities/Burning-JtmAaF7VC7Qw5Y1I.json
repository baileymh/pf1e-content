An item made mostly or entirely out of wood is even more susceptible to this effect, taking 2d6+2 points of fire damage. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. A creature that ends its turn in the same space as a burning object takes 1d6+1 points of fire damage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> Up to three times per day, the bearer of a <em>burning </em>weapon can, on command, cause a single object that has been ignited by the weapon to burn even brighter, increasing the duration of its burning effect by 1d4+1 rounds and causing the fire to expand in a burst that extends 5 feet from the object. This burst of fire deals 1d6+1 points of fire damage to each creature in that area, and it can ignite unattended flammable objects within that area as if they had been hit with the weapon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> Fire giants often make use of <em>burning </em>weapons in their fervid crusades against other races.</p><p><h3 class=\"framing\"><strong>Construction</strong></h3><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <em>elemental touch</em><sup>APG</sup>; <strong>Price</strong> -</p>",
