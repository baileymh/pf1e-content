      "value": "<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Spymaster's Handbook pg. 30</em></p><p><strong>Aura</strong> moderate transmutation <strong>CL</strong> 10th</p><p><strong>Price</strong> +7,500 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> -</p><p><h3 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" title=\"PFS Legal\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\"><strong>Description</strong></h3>This special ability can be placed only on a light or one-handed melee weapon. A <em>concealed </em> weapon alters its shape at its wielder's command, transforming into a non-weapon object of the wielder's choice. This object must be a mundane item whose size and shape is similar to that of the concealed weapon or smaller, and it must be sized for a creature of the same size as the weapon's intended wielder. For example, a Medium short sword can transform into a quill sized for a Medium creature, but it cannot transform into a saw sized for a Small creature. A <em>concealed </em>weapon cannot transform into a consumable item, and if its alternate form is that of a container, any contents stored within the concealed weapon's alternate form are ejected into the wielder's space when the weapon transforms back to its original form. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> While transformed, a <em>concealed </em>weapon doesn't register as magical, as per <em>magic aura</em>, though it retains the weight, hit points, and any hardness of its original form. A <em>concealed </em>weapon cannot assume the form of an object made from a special material (such as adamantine) unless it is already made of that material. For instance, a wooden club cannot transform into a mithral frying pan, but a mithral dagger can. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Transforming a <em>concealed</em> weapon into a mundane form requires a standard action, while returning it to its weapon form requires a move action. This transformation lasts until it is changed back into its original form or has been left unattended for 8 hours, whichever comes sooner.</p><p><h3 class=\"framing\"><strong>Construction</strong></h3><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <em>major creation</em> ; <strong>Price</strong> 3,750 gp</p>",
