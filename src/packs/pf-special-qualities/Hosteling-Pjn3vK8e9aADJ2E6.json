The wearer can speak a command word to magically store an animal to which he is bonded, such as an animal companion, a familiar, or mount. The stored animal appears as a symbol emblazoned upon the armor or shield, either one that mimics the appearance of the animal or that is more symbolic and abstract.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> While stored, the animal is sleeping and provides the wearer no benefit (such as a familiar's skill bonus). The size of animal that can be stored depends on the type of armor or shield. A suit of light armor, medium armor, or a light shield or heavy shield can store one animal up to the wearer's size. A suit of heavy armor or a tower shield can store one animal up to one size category larger than the wearer. A second command word releases the stored animal from the <em>hosteling </em>armor or shield. A released animal immediately awakens, appears in a space adjacent to the wearer, and can take actions on the round it appears.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> Because the stored animal is sleeping rather than in suspended animation (or even hibernating), it ages and gets hungry at the normal rate while stored. A <em>hosteling </em>armor or shield automatically releases a stored animal 24 hours after it was stored inside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> This armor special ability still works on bonded magical beasts that were once animals, but not outsiders, oozes, or other exotic companion creatures.</p><p><h3 class=\"framing\"><strong>Construction</strong></h3><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <em>secret chest</em>; <strong>Price</strong> +3,750 gp</p>",
