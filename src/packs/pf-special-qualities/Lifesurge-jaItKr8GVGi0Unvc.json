A <em>lifesurge </em>weapon boosts and sustains the wielder's life energy while he is in the throes of combat. The wielder gains a bonus on saving throws against necromantic effects-including the ability damage, ability drain, and energy drain powers of the undead-equal to the weapon's enhancement bonus. In addition, whenever the wielder receives temporary hit points from any source, he adds the weapon's enhancement bonus to these temporary hit points; this does not stack for temporary hit points from multiple sources, and these points are lost if the <em>lifesurge</em> weapon is not being wielded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In combat, the weapon's critical threat range is doubled abilities against undead; this does not stack with the <em>keen </em>special ability or Improved Critical. Whenever a <em>lifesurge </em>weapon confirms a critical hit against an undead creature, it erupts with 1d8 points of positive energy (2d8 for weapons with a critical multiplier of x3, 3d8 if it is x4); the wielder may choose to deal this as damage to an undead target or to absorb half this amount as healing, with the remaining positive energy dissipating.</p><p><h3 class=\"framing\"><strong>Construction</strong></h3><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Channel Smite, <em>cure serious wounds</em>, <em>death ward</em>, <em>disrupt undead</em>; <strong>Price</strong> -</p>",
