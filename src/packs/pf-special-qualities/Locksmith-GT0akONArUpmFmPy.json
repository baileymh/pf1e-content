At will, the wearer of <em>locksmith</em> armor can extend from her fingertips small, delicate wires that function as masterwork thieves' tools. There is no evidence of the existence of these tools when they're not in use, and a PC attempting a Spellcraft check to identify the properties of <em>locksmith</em> armor must exceed the normal DC by 15 or this property is not revealed (though the other functions of the armor are identified normally). Additionally, <em>locksmith</em> armor allows the wearer to transfer some or all of the armor's enhancement bonus to the wearer's Disable Device checks as an enhancement bonus. As a free action, the wearer chooses how to allocate the armor's enhancement bonus at the start of his turn, and the reduction to the armor's enhancement bonus and the bonus on Disable Device checks last until his next turn. The <em>locksmith</em> special ability can be applied only to light armor.</p><p><h3 class=\"framing\"><strong>Construction</strong></h3><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Magic Arms and Armor, <em>knock</em>; <strong>Price</strong> 3,250 gp</p>",
