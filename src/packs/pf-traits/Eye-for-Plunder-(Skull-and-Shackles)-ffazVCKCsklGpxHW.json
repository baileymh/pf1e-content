      "value": "<p><em>You've always had a keen eye for the glitter of gold or silver, and you've robbed enough rich merchants and raided enough ships to have a feel for where the most valuable plunder is hidden. You found yourself relatively well off when you got your share of your last voyage's plunder, and decided to spend a few of your hard-won coins at the Formidably Maid, a popular pirate tavern in Port Peril. Maybe the shine of your new wealth distracted you, however, because you never saw the miscreants who slipped something into your drink, knocking you out cold.</p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>You gain a +1 trait bonus on Appraise and Perception checks to find concealed or secret objects (including doors and traps). In addition, you begin the campaign with a selection mundane trade goods worth 50 gp that you were able to scrounge together during your first day on the Wormwood.</p>",
