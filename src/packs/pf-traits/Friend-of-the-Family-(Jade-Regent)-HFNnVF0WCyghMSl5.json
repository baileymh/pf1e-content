      "value": "<p><em>Your family has been close friends with the Mvashtis for as long as you've been alive. Old Niska Mvashti's recent death wasn't all that unexpected,she must have been over a hundred years old, as far as you know,but it was a sobering moment nonetheless.</em> <em>What no one else in your family knows, though, is that in the weeks before her death, Niska must have known that her days were numbered, because she called you to her house one day and made you make a promise: If her daughter Koya ever went on a long trip, you would go with her to ensure her safety. Although the chances of Koya going on a long trip seem remote (she must be at least 60 years old, after all), you've made a promise to Niska to accompany her daughter if such an event comes to pass.</em> <em>Ever since you made this promise, you've felt a strange sense of destiny looming in your future,you might even think that Niska is now watching over your shoulder, just as she asked you to watch over her daughter. As a result of this eerie sense of being watched over, you've been able to react to dangerous situations more quickly than ever.</p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>As long as Koya remains alive, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Perception checks, and Perception becomes a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten Koya.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>NPC Choices</strong></p>\n<p>Koya</p>",
