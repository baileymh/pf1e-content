      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You&rsquo;ve long been interested in the legacy of the Silver Ravens&mdash;a group of freedom fighters that rose to </span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">prominence in Kintargo during the Chelish Civil War. There&rsquo;s frustratingly little information today about the group, and you suspect that most of what was recorded about the Silver Ravens has long since been redacted or destroyed by government agents, but you&rsquo;ve managed to pick up a tidbit here and there. Most of your knowledge isn&rsquo;t so much about the Silver Ravens specifically, but more about general histories of rebel groups and freedom fighters who have fought against oppressive governments throughout history, both in Cheliax and beyond.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Your familiarity with rebel groups allows you to grant a +2 bonus on an Organization check of your choice once the party reestablishes the Silver Ravens during the first adventure. You can change which check you assign this bonus to once at the start of the rebellion&rsquo;s Upkeep phase. Your time preparing for joining the Silver Ravens has also honed your skill at remaining unseen. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Stealth checks, and Stealth is always a class skill for you.</span></p>",
