Whatever the relationship, you&rsquo;ve heard rumors about &ldquo;Lamm&rsquo;s Lambs,&rdquo; and of how the old man uses children as pickpockets and agents for his crimes. You&rsquo;ve even heard rumors that the child you&rsquo;re looking for has been spotted in the marketplaces in the company of known cutpurses and pickpockets. Although the Korvosan Guard has been understanding of your plight, it has its hands full with &ldquo;more important&rdquo; matters these days, it seems, and has not yet been able to learn anything more about Gaedren. No one else is interested in bringing Gaedren down and rescuing his victims&mdash; that task falls to you. Yet where could the old scoundrel be hiding?</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Choose one of the following benefits:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Missing Sibling</strong></p>\n<p>The missing child is a brother or sister.
