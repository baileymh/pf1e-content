      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You were forced to take part in a demonic ritual as a youth after having been captured by cultists. Whatever the ritual&rsquo;s purpose may have been, it didn&rsquo;t work out the way your captors envisioned&mdash;rather than corrupting your soul, you absorbed the ritual&rsquo;s energy and made it your own before you escaped to safety. Ever since, you&rsquo;ve been haunted by strange nightmares about the ritual, and have long felt that the energies it bathed you in have changed you. Recently, those energies have changed&mdash; it&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;ve finally managed to come to terms with your past and have turned the ritual&rsquo;s aftereffects to your advantage, following the old adage of what doesn&rsquo;t kill you makes you stronger. You&rsquo;ve been unable to learn more about the ritual or what it was for, but the question lingers in the back of your head to this day. This nagging has instilled in you a fury against demonkind.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Today, when you face demons in combat, those energies bolster your fury, granting you a +2 trait bonus on all combat maneuver checks against demons.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Associated Mythic Path</span></strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Champion</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Multiple Characters</span></strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You and any other PC who takes this trait were all part of the same ritual, and it was only by working together that you managed to escape&mdash;further, the support of your fellow ritual survivors has played a key role in your coming to terms with it, and you retain a close bond of friendship (or perhaps a friendly rivalry) to this day.</span></p>",
