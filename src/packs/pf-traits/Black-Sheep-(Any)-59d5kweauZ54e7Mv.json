You know many of the region&rsquo;s secrets and the locals already know who you are. You aren&rsquo;t quite hated in town, but folk seem to think you&rsquo;re a troublemaker and a bastard and not to be trusted. The town&rsquo;s tougher folk respect you, but the law-abiding citizens don&rsquo;t.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks, and Knowledge (local) is a class skill for you. In addition, you can choose any one notorious citizen from below as an ally; depending on the person you pick, you&rsquo;ll get different benefits.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Notorious Citizens</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\"><strong>Apothecary</strong></span></p>\n<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Everyone suspects the sweaty, shifty-eyed apothecary sells poisons from his cluttered, acrid smelling wreck of a shop. You&rsquo;re one of the few in town who know this for a fact.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You start the game with 400 gp worth of poison, and the apothecary will continue to sell you poison as long as you don&rsquo;t spread the word. </span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\"><br /><strong>Bitter Nobleman</strong></span></p>\n<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">A local unscrupulous family was hit hard recently, revealing criminal ties that damaged its reputation as well. One noble is eager to rebuild his presence in town, and you&rsquo;re one of the ones he&rsquo;s selected as an agent.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Choose one of the following skills: Bluff, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth. Your work for the family gives you a +1 trait bonus on that skill, and it is always a class skill for you.</span></p>",
