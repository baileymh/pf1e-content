      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You, or perhaps your family, were once worshipers of Asmodeus, but something happened that made you lose your faith. Perhaps your family was asked to give up something dear as a sacrifice, such as the life of a newly born brother or sister. Maybe the church used your family as a scapegoat to cover up a crime someone higher in the church committed. Or perhaps you simply met someone who opened your eyes and showed you the truth&mdash;that Asmodeus does not care for his followers, and that the deity of your new religion does. In any event, you left the church, and as a result, your family was punished; they were either put in prison, exiled from Kintargo, or perhaps even executed. Ever since, you&rsquo;ve vowed to some day get revenge against the church.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Choose one:</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls or you gain a +1 trait bonus on the save DCs of your spells against agents of House Thrune and worshipers of Asmodeus, including most (but not all) devils.</span></p>",
