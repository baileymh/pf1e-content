      "value": "<p><em>You awake with a strange sensation beyond the frightening experience of extensive memory loss. Full recollections of the experience&mdash;like so many others&mdash;have been wiped from your mind, but at some point in your past your mind was swapped with that of a yithian, an alien being from beyond time and space. You don&rsquo;t remember details of your experiences wandering the yithians&rsquo; peculiar city in a foreign body&mdash; and even worry whether this might be some strange hallucination&mdash; but every so often, a flash of insight strikes you as a result of this experience. You know that you can rely on these alien flashbacks during your investigation into your current situation, as it gives you greater perspective into an otherwise confusing world.</p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Once per day, you can reroll one Knowledge check that you have just failed. In addition, you can attempt untrained Knowledge checks with DCs up to 20 instead of 10.</p>",
