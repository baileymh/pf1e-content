      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\"><em>You had the fortune to be born into one of Cheliax&rsquo;s noble families, and even more importantly, your family is one of those loyal to House Thrune. Perhaps your family has been allied with Thrune since the Chelish Civil War, or maybe Thrune granted your family its title in exchange for its support during that conflict. In any case, your experience growing up among the nation&rsquo;s well-to-do has given you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With the nascent uprising of the Glorious Reclamation in Cheliax, there is much concern among the aristocracy, and House Thrune needs the support of loyal nobles now more then ever.</em><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">This trait assumes you belong to a minor noble human family with a small manor or estate in some backwater of the empire. If you&rsquo;re not human, either you were adopted into a noble human family, or your family was recently granted a nonhereditary noble title</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (nobility) checks, and Knowledge (nobility) is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on Charismabased checks against other members of the Chelish aristocracy. The Noble Scion feat does not have a Charisma prerequisite for you. Lastly, you start play with a noble&rsquo;s outfit, a signet ring, and a single additional nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp.</span></p>",
