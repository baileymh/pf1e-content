Of course, that's probably because she helped raise you. You have never quite figured out why Shalelu decided to treat you as a younger sibling, but you certainly appreciated it,and you eagerly absorbed all of the survivalist tricks that she showed you over the years.</p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>You gain a +2 trait bonus on all Survival checks, and Survival is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your mentor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>NPC Choices</strong></p>\n<p>Shalelu</p>",
