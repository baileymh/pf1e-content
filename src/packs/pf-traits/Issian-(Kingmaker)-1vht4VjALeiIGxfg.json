      "value": "<p><em>You were raised northern Brevoy, a land of misty shores and harsh hill lands, of snowy vistas and violet-hued mountains. You are descended from an able and intelligent people, and you have grand ambitions, a mind alert for opportunity, and the tenacity to fight for your goals no matter the challenge. You care for little more than achieving your aspirations and opportunities to win wealthy and grandeur, for which few costs prove too great. You see yourself as a citizen of Brevoy through and through. The call for champions willing to help take back your country's rightful holdings in the Stolen Lands has inflamed your dreams of profit and possibilities, so you have joined an expedition to quest south.</p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Your agile mind grants you a +1 trait bonus on all Will saves made to resist mind-affecting effects.</p>",
