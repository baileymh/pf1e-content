Perhaps your family was accused of being dishonorable or cowardly, or maybe one of your family members was the victim of church &ldquo;justice.&rdquo; Or perhaps you simply met someone who opened your eyes and showed you the truth&mdash;that the Inheritor&rsquo;s so-called honor, valor, and justice are just tin plating on a strict dogma that seeks to control people by restricting their free will. In any event, you left the church, and as a result, your family was subjected to scorn and holier-than-thou disapproval. Ever since, you&rsquo;ve vowed to some day get revenge against the church of Iomedae&mdash;and with the current situation brewing in Cheliax, you might finally have the opportunity.</em><br /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Choose one:</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Against followers of Iomedae, including many (but not all) archons and angels, you gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls, or you gain a +1 trait bonus on the save DCs of your spells.</span></p>",
