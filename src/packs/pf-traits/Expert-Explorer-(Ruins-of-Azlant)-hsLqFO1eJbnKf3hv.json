You get fidgety and impatient when you become too familiar with a certain place. You are used to having excitement and the quest for knowledge guides your path in life, and you picked up a number of skills along the way that relate to this lifestyle. During your interview with the Bountiful Venture Company, they were impressed with the diverse locations you&rsquo;ve visited in your life and selected you because of your skills in maneuvering uncharted territory.</em></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Choose one Knowledge skill when you gain this trait. You gain a +1 trait bonus to check with that Knowledge skill and Survival checks, and either that Knowledge skill or Survival is a class skill for you. In addition, you treat the machete as a simple weapon.</span></p>",
