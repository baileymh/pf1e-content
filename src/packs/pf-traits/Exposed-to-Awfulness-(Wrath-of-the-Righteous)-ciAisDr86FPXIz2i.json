      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">When you were a child, you were nearly slain by a demon that managed to make its way through the wardstones into the lands beyond. The demon was slain before it could kill you, but you lingered at death&rsquo;s door in a coma for weeks before waking. Ever since then, you&rsquo;ve been unusually hale and hearty, as if your body had endured its brush with awfulness by becoming supernaturally fit. But still, the scars (whether physical or purely mental) of your brush with death remain, and nightmares of what could have happened often plague your sleep. Something, be it your own personal force of will, some strange &ldquo;infection&rdquo; from the assault, or perhaps a combination of both, has made you stronger than before. You&rsquo;re not sure what to make of the theories that you survived this exposure to awfulness because you yourself have some trace of demonic heritage that helped give you the advantage you needed to survive&mdash; but whatever it was, you&rsquo;re glad for it! Your strange resistance to demonic attacks persists to this day.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Once per day when you fail a saving throw against an effect created by a demon that would kill or physically incapacitate you, you can immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">A</span><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">ssociated Mythic Path</span></strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Guardian</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Multiple Characters</span></strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You and any others with this trait are related, if only distantly. You could be siblings or cousins&mdash;a condition that perhaps lends some credence to the theory that all of you share more than just a common bloodline.</span></p>",
