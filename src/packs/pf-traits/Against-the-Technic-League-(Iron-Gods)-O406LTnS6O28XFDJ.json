      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Although the Black Sovereign rules Numeria in name, it&rsquo;s the spellcasters of the Technic League who hold the real power. While their inf luence is certainly strongest in the capital of Starfall, their touch can be felt even here in Torch&mdash;the League takes a significant cut of the town&rsquo;s income as tithes every month. For some reason, you have a grudge against the Technic League. Perhaps your parents lost their jobs as the result of an act they took that displeased the League&mdash;you might even suspect the League was responsible for their deaths. Alternatively, you could just rankle at the League&rsquo;s open acceptance of slavery, their reputation for sadism and cruelty, or their penchant for hoarding and controlling technological wonders. Talk to your GM to refine the reasons why you hate the Technic League, but you&rsquo;re convinced that they are somehow responsible for putting out the town&rsquo;s torch and that evidence of their tampering can be found in the caverns below&mdash;if you can find evidence of the Technic League working against Torch&rsquo;s better interests, that could well be a step toward the town&rsquo;s independence from the League.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Choose either weapons or spells. If you choose weapons, you gain a +2 trait bonus on all damage rolls made against targets you know are associated with the Technic League. If you choose spells, increase the save DC of your spells by 1 when you target such a foe.</span></p>",
