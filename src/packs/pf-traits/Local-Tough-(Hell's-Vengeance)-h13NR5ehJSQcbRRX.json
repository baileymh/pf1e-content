      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You were born and raised in the town of Longacre on the southwestern fringes of the Whisperwood, or at least have lived there long enough that you&rsquo;re considered a native. You&rsquo;ve never been one for the quiet life, and have been considered a miscreant and reprobate since you were a child. As an adult, you&rsquo;ve made something of a name for yourself as a thug, enforcer, and petty thief in town, hiring yourself out to anybody who needs muscle in exchange for a few coins. In the course of such employment, you&rsquo;ve worked with another local troublemaker named Cimri Staelish and have become friends. Cimri has recently gotten involved with some shadowy, though powerful, characters, and as Hell&rsquo;s Vengeance begins, you and a group of other ne&rsquo;erdo- wells have agreed to help Cimri burgle a tannery just outside town. With luck, this could be the start of bigger and better things than just working as hired muscle.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You gain a +1 trait bonus on Intimidate checks, and Intimidate is a class skill for you. In addition, you gain a +1 trait bonus on weapon damage rolls when you are flanking a foe with an ally.</span></p>",
