When you escaped that city, you had to use your captors&rsquo; weapons and magic against them in addition to your sheer wits, and you learned how to find weaknesses in their natural resistances.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl85_LabelType\">At character creation, select acid, cold, electricity, or fire (once chosen, this selection can&rsquo;t be changed). Once per day as a swift action, you can choose a single creature that is within 30 feet of you and within your line of sight; treat that creature&rsquo;s resistance against your chosen energy as 5 lower than its normal energy resistance for 1 round. This ability has no effect if the creature has no resistance to the chosen energy or if the creature has immunity to the chosen energy.</span></p>",
