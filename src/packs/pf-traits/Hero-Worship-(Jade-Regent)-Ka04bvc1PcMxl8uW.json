      "value": "<p><em>Everyone in town seems to admire Ameiko and Shalelu,they're heroes, after all, and played key roles in the recent troubles that plagued Sandpoint. You, though, take this admiration to a new level,you practically worship one of these two. This could be because you saw one of them perform a particularly impressive act of bravery at some point in the past, or maybe they just happened to give you the exact right words of encouragement or a kind gift at some point a few years ago when you were young and impressionable. In any case, you've done your best to emulate your hero's talents at spellcasting or combat.</p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>You gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your hero as well as one of the following:</p>\n<p>If your hero is Ameiko, you gain a +2 bonus on concentration checks. If your hero is Shalelu, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC against attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>NPC Choices</strong></p>\n<p>Ameiko, Shalelu</p>",
