      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You spent a period of time as one of Gaedren Lamm&rsquo;s enslaved orphans, doing all manner of dirty work for him. Maybe you were abducted from your parent&rsquo;s home or during a trip to the market. Perhaps the irresponsible matron who ruled your orphanage traded you to him in return for a desperately needed financial loan. Or perhaps you, like most of Gaedren&rsquo;s slaves, were merely a child of the street who succumbed to his promise of regular meals and a roof in return for what he said would be &ldquo;a little light work.&rdquo; Whatever the case, you spent several years of your life as one of &ldquo;Lamm&rsquo;s Lambs&rdquo; before escaping. You&rsquo;ve nursed a grudge against the old man ever since.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Choose one of the following benefits:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Tortured</strong></p>\n<p>Gaedren tortured you and left you for dead on a garbage heap after you made one too many errors. Your scars and memories have honed your reaction speed and make you rather jumpy. You gain a +1 bonus on Reflex saves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Religious</strong></p>\n<p>You found a holy symbol of the god you worship today while on a job for Gaedren and, intrigued by it, you snuck off to attend services. When Gaedren found out, he beat you to within an inch of your life and broke your holy symbol. Your faith let you block out the pain, and you escaped his control and took shelter in the church, where you spent the rest of your youth. You gain a +2 bonus on Concentration checks.</p>",
