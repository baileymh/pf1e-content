Perhaps it was your parents, or an older sibling, or an uncle or aunt,whatever the case, one of your close relatives is, or was, a well-known and well-loved actor or actress. That this relation died in some compromising and embarrassing way has done little to alter your family's name and fame,if anything, the unfortunate death has increased it.</p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>When folk learn your last name, they are quick to assume you live a wild life like your ill-fated relative, and whether you bask in this notoriety or do your best to hide your heritage, the years of association with the acting scene have had their effect. You've certainly inherited your relative's talents, and are a larger-than-life figure, a melodramatic attention-hound, or a sly manipulator of emotions. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Perform (act) skill checks, and the skill is always considered a class skill for you. Furthermore, you've inherited some of your relative's funds, and begin play with a nest egg of 300 gp that you can spend however you wish.</p>",
