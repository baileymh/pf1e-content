      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\"><em>Much of Kintargo&rsquo;s history is lost or hidden. You know because you&rsquo;ve made a point of seeking out those secrets. Local urban legends and bits of strange historical rumors have long fascinated you&mdash;who knows what amazing truths about Kintargo&rsquo;s past have been lost forever to the redactors of House Thrune? What caused Professor Mangvhune of the Alabaster Academy to become the city&rsquo;s most infamous serial killer? Who were the dragons Adrakash, Ithanothaur, and Rivozair, and what were their ties to Kintargo? Why do the Devil&rsquo;s Bells of the Temple of Asmodeus seem to ring at random times, and is there a pattern to the peals? Who were the Silver Ravens who defended Kintargo during the Chelish Civil War, and why did they vanish so soon after that war&rsquo;s resolution? So many mysteries, and who better than you to find the answers?</em><br /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Pick one of the questions above as your focus. Answers to these questions can be discovered at different points during Hell&rsquo;s Rebels, but don&rsquo;t expect to learn these answers any time soon! More important, your choice of focus grants you a +1 trait bonus in a particular Knowledge skill check associated with that focus (pick one of the two options provided below for your question). That Knowledge skill is always a class skill for you. Once per day, when you attempt a Knowledge skill check in either of the types associated with your focus, you can roll twice and take the better result as your actual result.</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\"><br /><em>Devil&rsquo;s Bells</em>: Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (planes)</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\"><br /><em>Local Dragons</em>: Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (history)</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\"><br /><em>Professor Mangvhune</em>: Knowledge (local) or Knowledge (planes)</span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\"><br /><em>Silver Ravens</em>: Knowledge (local) or Knowledge (history).</span></p>",
