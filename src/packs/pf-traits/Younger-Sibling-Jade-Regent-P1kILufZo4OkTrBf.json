While your sibling always took care of you, he or she never supported your desire to become an adventurer,your sibling never explained why, only saying, \"Adventuring can cause a lot of pain just as easily as it can bring success and riches.\"</em> <em>As a younger sibling to one of Sandpoint's more influential citizens, you share some of that NPC's innate talent and skill at adventuring.</p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>You gain a +1 trait bonus on all attack rolls against foes that threaten your older sibling as well as one of the following:</p>\n<p>If you're Ameiko's younger sibling, your ferocious independence and self-confidence give you a +1 trait bonus on Will saving throws. If you're Sandru's younger sibling, your hearty constitution gives you a +1 trait bonus on all Fortitude saving throws. If you're Shalelu's younger sibling, your quick ref lexes give you a +1 trait bonus on all Reflex saving throws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n<p>Although you're a younger sibling of an established NPC, this doesn't necessarily lock you in to being the same race as that NPC,if you're a different race or ethnicity than the NPC you choose as your older sister or brother, you were adopted into the family by your parents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>NPC Choices</strong></p>\n<p>Ameiko, Sandru, Shalelu.</p>",
