      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Your parents were members of the crusade, as were their parents before them. (If you are an elf, gnome, or other long-lived race, these could be brothers or cousins instead, since it&rsquo;s possible that the Worldwound simply didn&rsquo;t exist at a time before you were born.) The righteousness of the crusades sometimes feels as if it runs in your very blood, and it bolsters you against demonic inf luence. Your parents may be alive still, or they may have perished on a mission&mdash;that choice is up to you. You grew up knowing them, though, and their zeal and devotion to the crusade is the primary reason you feel the same way. They&rsquo;ve told you of other family members who have also been involved in the crusade, and it&rsquo;s not uncommon for you to meet a distant cousin or long-lost aunt, uncle, or other family member while traveling among the border towns of Mendev. This strong family tie bolsters your mind and sense of belonging to the crusade.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Once per day when you fail a saving throw against an effect created by a demon that would possess or incapacitate you mentally, you may immediately reroll that saving throw as a free action. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Associated Mythic Path</span></strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Marshal</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Multiple Characters</span></strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">If other characters take this trait, you should all be related&mdash;you can be siblings, cousins, or even more distant relations, but you should all be aware of this shared lineage.</span></p>",
