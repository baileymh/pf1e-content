      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">As long as you can remember, you&rsquo;ve had an unexplainable interest in one deity in particular. One of your parents may have been a priest of this deity, or you may have been an orphan raised by the church, but these alone cannot explain your deep connection to the faith. You&rsquo;ve always felt calm and at ease in places holy to the deity, and often have dreams about the god or goddess visiting you&mdash;most often in the form of a sacred animal or creature. Your faith is strong, even if you don&rsquo;t happen to be a divine spellcaster&mdash;if you are a divine spellcaster, you should be a worshiper of this deity.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You begin play with a silver holy symbol of your chosen deity for free. In addition, choose one domain associated with your chosen deity. You gain the use of that domain&rsquo;s 1st-level domain spell as a spell-like ability usable once per day (CL equals your character level).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Associated Mythic Path</span></strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Hierophant</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Multiple Characters</span></strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">If other characters choose this trait, you should all work together to decide what deity you&rsquo;re associated with&mdash;it should be the same deity shared by all of you. You might even share the same dreams.<br /></span></p>",
