      "value": "<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl19_LabelType\">You were raised to uphold a specific set of tenets, and you never had reason to doubt their veracity. Recent events, however, have undermined that certainty, and you now find yourself wondering if any of the universal truths you once believed in can actually hold up to scrutiny. Perhaps you witnessed a mentor or church official fall from grace or violate your shared tenets. Maybe you watched a friend injured terribly despite (or because of ) their pure faith.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl19_LabelType\">Whatever the case, your shaken confidence grants you a +1 trait bonus on saving throws against illusions. You may replace any other faith trait with the Crisis of Faith trait whenever you gain a level. This replacement is permanent until you receive <em>atonement</em>.</span></p>",
