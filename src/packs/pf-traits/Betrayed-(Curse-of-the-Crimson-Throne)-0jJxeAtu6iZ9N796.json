      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You were hardly a model citizen as a child or young adult. Your reasons for turning to a life of crime may be varied, but what matters is that you eventually fell in with a certain well-connected and notorious crime lord named Gaedren Lamm. His reputation as a snake and a treacherous scoundrel was known to you, but for reasons of your own, you chose not to turn him down when he offered you a chance to work for him. You may have assumed you were an exception, or that you&rsquo;d be able to handle him, or perhaps even planned to betray him. As it worked out, though, Gaedren got the upper hand and took you down you first. You may have served time in jail, may have been beaten by his thugs and left for dead, or could simply have had your profits stolen out from under you. Whatever the cause, Gaedren wronged you, and you are eager for the chance to get revenge.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Choose one of the following benefits:<br /><br /><strong>Hungry for Revenge</strong></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You&rsquo;ve never forgiven Gaedren for his betrayal, and have vowed to make him pay for what he did. Whether that&rsquo;s seeing him rot in jail or a shallow grave, you hope to taste vengeance someday. Whenever you deal damage with a melee weapon on a creature that is flat-footed, you gain a +1 trait bonus on the damage roll. <br /><br /><strong>Reformed Criminal</strong></span></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You&rsquo;ve given up the life of crime, and managed to talk your way out of any repercussions such as jail time or fines. You&rsquo;ve told yourself that you would rather leave your past behind, yet the concept of seeing Gaedren Lamm pay for his crimes still appeals to you. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks, and Diplomacy is a class skill for you.</span></p>",
