      "value": "<p><em>Whether you knew Professor Lorrimor well or only in passing, as a colleague or competitor, his career and lifetime of discovery inspired you to be better at what you do. As you honed your craft, you and the professor corresponded, and he was delighted to hear that he had directly or indirectly motivated you to strive for your full potential. Saddened by the news of his death, you feel that you should honor his memory by fulfilling his final wishes and attending his funeral, and by ever striving to attain greater heights and someday match the influence and impact of your idol.</p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Choose one spell you can cast. From now on, you always cast this spell at +1 caster level.</p>",
