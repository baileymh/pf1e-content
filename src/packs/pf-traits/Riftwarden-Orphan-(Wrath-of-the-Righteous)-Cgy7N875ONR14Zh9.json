      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You bear a strange birthmark on your body&mdash;something you&rsquo;ve learned is the Sign of the Seeker&rsquo;s Spiral, a rune associated with the secret society known as the Riftwardens. You have researched this rune, and have learned that the mark sometimes appears on the children of Riftwardens who have been exposed to particularly strange planar energies. Unfortunately, you never knew your parents, for you were raised by a foster family in Kenabres. Your foster family has conf irmed that both of your parents were Riftwardens, and has further conf irmed that your parents went missing on a secret mission into the Worldwound less than a month after you were born. You&rsquo;re not sure what happened to them, but you&rsquo;re certain they&rsquo;re dead&mdash;and your gut tells you that the one who murdered them yet lives! In any event, you&rsquo;ve long felt magic in your blood, and casting spells comes easily to you.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You gain a +2 trait bonus on all concentration checks.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Associated Mythic Path</span></strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Archmage</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Multiple Characters</span></strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You should be siblings with any other character that takes this trait, so that you share the same missing parents. Your parents could even be foster parents.</span></p>",
