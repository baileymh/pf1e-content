      "value": "<p><em>You have lived all your life in and around the city of Restov, growing up on tales of Baron Sirian Aldori and the exploits of your home city's heroic and legendary swordlords. Perhaps one of your family members was an Aldori swordlord, you have a contact among their members, or you have dreamed since childhood of joining. Regardless, you idolize the heroes, styles, and philosophies of the Aldori and have sought to mimic their vaunted art. Before you can petition to join their ranks, however, you feel that you must test your mettle. Joining an expedition into the Stolen Lands seems like a perfect way to improve your skills and begin a legend comparable to that of Baron Aldori.</p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>You begin play with a longsword or Aldori dueling sword and gain a +1 trait bonus on all attacks and combat maneuvers made with such weapons.</p>",
