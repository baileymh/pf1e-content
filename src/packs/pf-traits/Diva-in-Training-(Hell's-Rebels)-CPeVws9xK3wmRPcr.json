      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">The opera is perhaps the most important and prestigious form of entertainment offered in Kintargo, and the Kintargo Opera House is among the most famous of its kind. You&rsquo;re hardly a superstar among the performers who&rsquo;ve graced the stage there, but you have performed several times before in small parts. Just recently, you got your big break&mdash;you&rsquo;d won a role in the infamous opera Huntress of Heroes, and had been studying for the role furiously before the onset of martial law dashed your plans to the dirt. Now that the Kintargo Opera House has been claimed by Barzillai Thrune, all shows have been canceled and your chance at success seems to have been lost. Yet you can&rsquo;t lose hope. You still practice your skills, and some day, perhaps the Kintargo Opera House will open its doors again, at which point you intend to be center stage!</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Choose one type of Perform skill. You gain a +1 trait bonus in that specific Perform skill, and all Perform skills are class skills for you. You also increase the save DCs of all language-dependent spells and effects you create by 1.</span></p>",
