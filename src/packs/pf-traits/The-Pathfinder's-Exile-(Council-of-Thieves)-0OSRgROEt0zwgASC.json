      "value": "<p><em>Westcrown's dilapidated Pathfinder lodge of Delvehaven has long excited your imagination. Forcibly closed by the order of the city's diabolical rulers, the Pathfinders of Westcrown were exiled, forcing them to leave behind untold knowledge and the treasures of countless expeditions. Today, Delvehaven lies under the pale of fearful rumors and dark magic, and bureaucratic red tape has prevented trespass on the lodge's well-protected grounds. Having secretly and illegally contacted agents of the Pathfinders, you've expressed your interest in aiding their ventures in Cheliax,with a particular eye toward investigating Delvehaven, the source of your long-standing adventuresome interests. To your surprise, some days ago you received a message back from an unnamed Pathfinder operating underground in the country. Along with encouraging you to investigate the lodge and report your findings to the Grand Lodge in Absalom, he's sent along a battered and tarnished, yet still functional wayfinder. You've promised yourself to pay back your unknown contact the 500 gp cost of the item someday, but until then, it's yours to use.</p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>A wayfinder is a magical compass that grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost, and can be commanded to emit light as the spell (CL 5th) as a standard action. Further details on the Pathfinder Society and wayfinders can be found in the Pathfinder Campaign Setting or Pathfinder Chronicles: Seekers of Secrets.</p>",
