You were called to the scene by the Korvosan Guard to identify the body, and as rough as that was for you, you also noticed a ring was missing from the body. Whoever murdered your loved one stole that ring,you're convinced of it. You've done some investigation on your own and recently found the ring for sale at a local merchant. Although, to your great frustration, you can't afford yet to buy it back, the merchant did tell you from whom he purchased the ring: a man named Gaedren Lamm. It seems likely this criminal is the one who killed your loved one, or at the very least knows who did. The only problem is finding him.</p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Choose one of the following benefits:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Orphaned</strong></p>\n<p>The murder victim was your only surviving parent.
