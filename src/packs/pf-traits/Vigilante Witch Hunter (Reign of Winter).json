      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You don&rsquo;t trust witches. They deal with otherworldly beings, consort with beasts, and brew vile poisons in their cauldrons. As a child, perhaps you barely escaped some horrid fate at the hands of an evil witch, or maybe a loved one was stolen from you by a witch&rsquo;s charms. Perhaps you wanted to be a witch yourself, but the local witch refused to take you on as an apprentice. Whatever the reason, you now hate witches, and have dedicated your life to ferreting them out and exposing their wickedness for all to see. You know that the North is full of winter witches, and should you ever find yourself there, you&rsquo;ll relish bringing your justice to them as well.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You gain a +1 trait bonus on Sense Motive checks, and Sense Motive is a class skill for you. In addition, you begin the campaign with 1d4 <em>hex nails</em>.<br /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Equipment</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelName\"><strong>Aura</strong> faint abjuration; <strong>CL</strong> 3rd<br /><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Price</strong> 20 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> &mdash;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A <em>hex nail </em>is a thick, 6-inch-long nail forged from cold iron. Usually carried like charms or concealed within the heels of shoes, these roughly worked nails are the only protection many common citizens of Irrisen have against the White Witches and the cold fey of the North. Carrying a <em>hex nail </em>grants its possessor a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against the hexes, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of fey, hags, and witches. A <em>hex nail </em>automatically grants its bonus when its possessor is targeted by such an effect. Once a <em>hex nail </em>has granted its bonus on a single saving throw, it becomes a nonmagical nail. Most Jadwiga consider possession of a hex nail an act of treason.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> Craft Wondrous Item, <em>resistance</em>; <strong>Cost</strong> 10 gp</p>",
