      "value": "<p><em>On a ship, a sailor often has to learn multiple skills, and this rule certainly applies to you. Your father was a woodworker, and you learned your first trade from him. But on your first voyage at sea you quickly found out that a carpenter is often a ship's doctor as well,after all, who knows more about sawing off limbs than someone who saws wood for a living? People are a lot bloodier than wood, that's for sure, but you haven't had many complaints,those sailors who have enjoyed your services are either happy to be alive or dead, and there's old salts who swear the peg legs you for made them are better than the real legs they used to have. You were between ships in Port Peril, and after stopping for a drink at a tavern called the Formidably Maid, you happened upon a damsel in distress in the alleyway outside. Thinking you could help, you didn't notice the thugs hiding nearby, and they caught you unawares. You've been on enough ships to know a press gang by the blow of the sap on the back of your neck,you just hope whatever ship you end up on needs a surgeon. </em><em>Although the majority of your equipment was taken away when you were press-ganged, you managed to hang on to a fully stocked healer's kit, and you begin the campaign with it, regardless of your starting circumstances.</p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>You start with a fully stocked healer's kit, and you begin the campaign with it, regardless of your starting circumstances.</p>\n<p>You gain a +1 trait bonus on Craft (carpentry) and Heal checks, and Heal is a class skill for you.</p>",
