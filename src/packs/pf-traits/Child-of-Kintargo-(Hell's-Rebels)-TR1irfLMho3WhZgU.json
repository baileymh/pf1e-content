      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You had the fortune (or perhaps the misfortune, depending on your viewpoint) to be born into one of Kintargo&rsquo;s noble families. Your experience growing up among the city&rsquo;s well-to-do has given you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game with a modest inheritance. With the new situation in Kintargo brewing, there is much concern about an eventual restructuring of the city&rsquo;s nobility. Already, one noble estate has burned to the ground under what can best be described as suspicious circumstances, but whether the government or rebels were responsible depends on whom you ask.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">With this trait, the assumption is that you belong to a minor noble family (and can make up your family name). In this case, your family keeps a small manor in the Greens. If you want to be a member of one of Kintargo&rsquo;s major noble families, you must take the Noble Scion feat at 1st level.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (nobility) checks, and Knowledge (nobility) is always a class skill for you. The Noble Scion feat (see the sidebar on page 11) does not have a Charisma prerequisite for you. In addition, you start play with a noble&rsquo;s outfit, a signet ring, and a single additional nonmagical item worth no more than 200 gp. If you take the Noble Scion feat, your last name is probably Aulamaxa, Aulorian, Delronge, Jarvis, Jhaltero, Sarini, Tanessen, or Vashnarstill; if you&rsquo;re not human, you were adopted into the family. If you don&rsquo;t take this feat, you can make up your last name.</span></p>",
