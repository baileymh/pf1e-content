      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">There are patterns in the world, both natural and artificial, that if only one can interpret them correctly, great secrets could be divined. You have long been fascinated by the idea of these hidden patterns, perhaps because a sibling or parent went to the grave obsessed with seeking a pattern, or maybe because you feel that you&rsquo;ve uncovered a previously unknown pattern. Kintargo has a particularly unique pattern of its own; the belfry atop the Temple of Asmodeus rings at what seem to be random intervals. None know who or what rings the bells, and no true pattern by which the so-called Devil&rsquo;s Bells has yet accurately predicted the tolling. Many have tried, and extensive but always incomplete documents exist that track the dates and times of recorded ringings back to the end of the Chelish Civil War, when the church of Asmodeus first claimed the abandoned temple of Aroden as their own. Maybe you will be the one to solve the pattern of the Devil&rsquo;s Bells?</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You gain a +1 trait bonus on all Perception checks, and Perception is always a class skill for you. In addition, you increase the save DC of any illusion (pattern) spell you cast by 1, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against illusion effects.</span></p>",
