This equipment package is suitable for clerics, druids, inquisitors, oracles, and paladins.

Such adventurers are known as much for their flair and panache as their martial prowess, and the daring bravo&rsquo;s equipment is often ornately ornamented or personalized. This equipment package is good for a bard, fighter, rogue, swashbuckler, or vigilante. Certain cavaliers, investigators, skalds, or even paladins may also find it appealing. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Armor</strong>: Masterwork chain shirt.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Weapons</strong>: Light crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork rapier, sap, alchemical silver dagger.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Combat Gear</strong>: Acid (2), alchemist&rsquo;s kindness, <em>potions of cure light wounds</em> (2), sunrods (3).</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Other Gear</strong>: Backpack, bedroll, belt pouch, bottle of fine wine, chalk (5 pieces), courtier&rsquo;s outfit with 50 gp in jewelry, flask, flint and steel, grooming kit, masterwork musical instrument, mess kit, mirror, perfume or cologne, sack, signet ring, silk rope (50 ft.), trail rations (5 days), waterskin, whetstone, 5 gp.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Total Weight</strong>: 76-1/2 lbs.

It&rsquo;s especially suited to characters who focus on supporting their party members and making them more effective in a fight. Even more than with other equipment packages, the GM should consider substituting the masterwork longsword in this package with a masterwork melee weapon appropriate to the PC&rsquo;s faith. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Armor</strong>: Heavy steel shield, masterwork breastplate.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Weapons</strong>: Cold iron morningstar, heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork longsword.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Combat Gear</strong>: Alchemist&rsquo;s fire (3), holy water (4), <em>oil of bless weapon</em>, <em>potions of cure light wounds</em> (2), <em>potion of protection from evil</em>, sunrods (3).</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Other Gear</strong>: Backpack, bedroll, belt pouch, candles (5), chalk (5 pieces), crowbar, flint and steel, holy symbol (silver), mess kit, sack, silk rope (50 ft.), trail rations (5 days), waterskin, 7 gp.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Total Weight</strong>: 102 lbs.
