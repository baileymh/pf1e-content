      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You&rsquo;ve always felt separated from the era into which you were born. Perhaps you feel that you were born too late, and that you and your interests are better suited to a previous age. Maybe you have the conviction you were born too soon, and that your true destiny lies in some distant future. You might be suffering from missing time&mdash;whether a few hours, a few weeks, or even several months&mdash;for which you have no memories. You might instead receive brief visions of friends or enemies much older or younger than their actual age. You&rsquo;ve long since grown used to this strange condition, but have not yet determined why you suffer from it. Your GM will be provided with additional information about this trait&rsquo;s strange nature in the third adventure of Return of the Runelords.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You have a knack for knowing when to act a few instants in advance and gain a +2 trait bonus on Initiative checks. Once per adventure as an immediate action, you may use your strange link to the flow of time to force the GM to reroll a single d20 roll. You must declare the use of this ability immediately after the GM rolls the d20, but you can choose to do so after learning the results of the roll.</span></p>",
