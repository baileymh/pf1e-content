      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Some people follow codes and traditions; others look out for only themselves. You don&rsquo;t care&mdash;you do what you want, when you want, sometimes for a good reason, and sometimes for no reason at all. You revel in your status as an outlier, and take pride in the fact that you follow no one else&rsquo;s orders&mdash;at least most of the time. In a lawful land like Cheliax, one has to be more careful and at least pay lip service to the rules and restrictions of society. As a result, you try to manage the chaos that rages within your soul, but you&rsquo;re always on the lookout for the opportunity to truly unleash destruction. These days, there&rsquo;s plenty of work for someone who will do what needs to be done, no questions asked, and the rewards from House Thrune for those who work with it are a strong incentive as well. If working with others gives you the freedom to carry out some of your darkest instincts without fear of repercussion, then why not&mdash;at least for now. You can worry about the future when it comes.</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Chaotic evil</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Your unpredictability and volatile temperament gives you an advantage over your foes. You gain a +2 trait bonus on initiative checks. In addition, you are willing to work with others, and have learned to use your allies&rsquo; strengths to reinforce your own skills and abilities. Once per day, as long as an ally is within 10 feet of you, you can reroll a single attack roll or skill check before success or failure is known. You must take the results of the second roll, even if it is worse.</span></p>",
