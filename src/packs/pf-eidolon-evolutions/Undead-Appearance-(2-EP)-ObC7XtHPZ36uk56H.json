      "value": "<p>An eidolon appears as an undead creature, and mimics some of an undead creature's abilities and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>Negative energy heals the eidolon, and positive energy (including a cleric's channel energy ability) harms it. Spells and effects that target undead or have specific effects against undead (such as Command Undead, <em>hold undead</em>, and <em>searing light</em>) affect the eidolon as if it were undead. The eidolon gains a +2 bonus on saves against disease, exhaustion, fatigue, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning. <br /><br />At 7th level, this bonus on saves can be increased to +4 by spending 2 additional evolution points. At 12th level, this protection can be increased to immunity against these attacks by spending 2 additional evolution points (the summoner must pay for the 7th-level upgrade before paying for this 12th-level upgrade). <br /><br />Although the eidolon appears undead, it is still an outsider.</p>",
