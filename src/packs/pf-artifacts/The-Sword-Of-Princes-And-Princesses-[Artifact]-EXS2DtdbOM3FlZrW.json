      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This +3 short sword is only usable by a Small being. It otherwise functions as a -2 cursed short sword for anyone else (though it retains its other abilities and its curse). This sword has a blade of a bluish metal with nursery rhymes engraved on it. This sword has the ability to cast locate object (for the Sword of Kings and Queens only) 1/hour. It can cast light 1/day, and can cast protection from evil and sanctuary, each 1/week. The wielder of this sword has a continuous effect of feather fall and water walk while the sword is drawn. It has an ego of 24 (never trust anyone over 30) and an intelligence of 12. Like its parent sword, this sword initially carries a curse. This curse can only be removed by a miracle, wish or by the prescribed method. The effect of the curse is two-fold. First, it causes fear on its wielder whenever he enters combat (DC 20 Will save avoids). Second, if the wielder saves, the sword falls out of the characters hand every other round of combat, quivering on the ground (the sword itself trembles with fear). This curse can be lifted permanently by striking it with the blade of the non-cursed parent sword (spanking it).<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +3 short sword|-2 cursed short sword</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Rappan Athuk",
