      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This portable orrery models Golarion's solar system, and is collapsible down to a 1-foot-diameter globe-expanding it out to its full size (about 4 feet across) or collapsing it takes 2d6 minutes.  When expanded, the orrery of distant worlds becomes affixed to whatever surface it sits upon, functioning as if anchored to that surface via an immovable rod. If consulted, it grants a +10 bonus on all Knowledge (geography) checks made to navigate or to answer questions about outer space. Once per month, it may be used to contact alien minds on far-flung worlds-this works identically to the spell contact other plane (use the demigod line to determine the effects of the spell or to determine ability score decreases). At your discretion, use of the orrery can have unanticipated results, as it can accidentally release stored information when activated (see area D7 on page 24 for an example of this event).  The 11 planetary spheres and the sun sphere can be detached and carried separately. As long as even one of these spheres is missing, the orrery cannot be collapsed or moved, nor can it be used to contact alien minds. Once detached, a planetary sphere carries 4 charges that can be used to activate a spell effect. The effects of the 12 spheres and the number of charges required to use a sphere's spell are as follows:  • Sun-searing light (1 charge)  • Aballon-haste (2 charges)  • Castrovel-detect thoughts (1 charge)  • Golarion-resilient sphere (4 charges)  • Akiton-rage (1 charge)  • Verces-align weapon (1 charge)  • Eox-death ward (2 charges)  • Triaxus-teleport (4 charges)  • Liavara-dream (4 charges)  • Bretheda-restoration (2 charges)  • Apostae-fly (2 charges)  • Aucturn-confusion (2 charges)  A sphere can be recharged by replacing it on the orrery, at which point it may be recharged by an arcane spellcaster in the same method by which a staff is recharged.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Doom Comes To Dustpawn",
