      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The gleaming, gold scepter bears elegant boughs and leaves,  blooming into a miniature, flowered treetop at one end. The scepter's rod has four slots, onto which four large rings can be slotted. Each ring is engraved with a phrase in Sylvan, and can be placed upon or removed from the scepter as a standard action.  Ring 1: Daughters of the Fangwood green.  Ring 2: Hear my ardent call.  Ring 3: Discharge now to oaths long sworn.  Ring 4: For Accressiel glory, live or fall.  Dryad's Song grants anyone holding it a +5 morale bonus on all Diplomacy and Intimidate skill checks against fey that live within Fangwood Forest. Dryad's Song allows its wielder to cast diminish plants, entangle, plant growth, and wood shape at will, though these spells affect plants only within Fangwood Forest. Up to three times each day, by reciting the poem on its rings as a full-round action, Dryad's Song allows its wielder to either summon 40 HD worth of  dryads, nymphs, and satyrs, or allows its wielder and up to 19 additional Medium or smaller creatures to teleport anywhere within the Fangwood Forest as if they were very familiar with the destination. Summoned fey remain for 20 hours, can be dismissed at will, and are not obligated to obey the wielder's command; dryads summoned by Dryad's Song lose their tree dependence weakness while they serve on the wielder's behalf. Unlike the corrupted version of the artifact, the fully restored Dryad's Song grants access to its magic whether its various rings are slotted into the scepter or not. Just like the corrupted version, Dryad's Song can purge the Darkblight from a living creature within 60 feet as a full-round action.  A ring from the scepter may be gifted to another person. The ring can be worn as a bracelet or on a necklace (occupying the appropriate magic item slot), and grants a +3 resistance bonus on its wearer's saving throws. Once per day, the ring can be used to contact the wielder of Dryad's Song via sending.  The glaistig Gendowyn maintains a powerful connection to the artifact, and can summon Dryad's Song to her hand as a standard action.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 119",
