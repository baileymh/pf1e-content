      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Suishen is a +2 defending flaming katana (see page 27). The ancestral blade of the Amatatsu family, Suishen is believed to contain the soul of the first Amatatsu emperor of Minkai. It has been passed down through generations of the family, serving as advisor and spiritual guide. It was actually Suishen's idea to be sold to Fynn Snaevald in order to save the family line.  Suishen can detect any scion of the Amatatsu family within 60 feet, whether a natural-born descendant or a person invested with the right to rule as an Amatatsu (such as a creature marked by the Amatatsu Seal). Although Suishen is neutral good, any Amatatsu scion, regardless of alignment, can wield the sword without gaining a negative level. This boon is at Suishen's discretion, however, and should such a scion ever betray the family or prove unworthy as an heir, the sword can reinstate this penalty and cause a personality conflict. Even though Suishen can likely dominate anyone who tries to wield it, the sword usually acquiesces to the wishes of its wielder, provided she is a rightful Amatatsu scion-though after 50 years of holding its silence, Suishen is a bit rough as a conversationalist, communicating in a very gruff, no-nonsense manner.  Suishen has a number of additional abilities as well, though it reveals these powers to its wielder only after she has shown herself honorable and worthy of bearing the family's heirloom blade. Each time Suishen's wielder is involved in a fight in which an oni of the Five Storms (such as Kimandatsu) is killed, the wielder is made aware of one new power in the following order. If a new person wields Suishen, that person must learn the sword's additional powers all over again.  • Resist energy (cold) 3/day becomes protection from energy (cold) at will.  • Suishen gains the flaming burst ability.  • Invisibility purge at will.  • Suishen gains the bane ability against creatures with the oni subtype.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 50",
