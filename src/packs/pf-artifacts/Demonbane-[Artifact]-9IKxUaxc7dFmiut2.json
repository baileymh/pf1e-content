      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Demonbane was forged with one purpose in mind: to kill demons, specifically Orcus. Strangely, Demonbane was created not by paladins or clerics of good, but rather by the arch-devil, Baalzebul, who proposed to overthrow the Lord of the Undead. Because of their mutual evil alignments, the sword focuses on law versus chaos. Also, because the archdevil did not particularly care who used the sword against Orcus, he made it lawful neutral, rather than lawful evil. This sword functions as a +3 cold iron axiomatic keen bastard sword, the wielder gains a +4 insight bonus on all saves against attacks from demons, the sword automatically ignores the damage reduction of any demon it strikes, and the wielder of Demonbane is immune to the wand of Orcus. If used against a devil (or any other lawful evil outsider), the sword becomes powerless and nonmagical for 24 hours. Once in the possession of a lawful-aligned PC, the sword urges its wielder toward that end. It knows Orcus is near and can guide the PC by letting him know if he is getting closer or further away from the Demon Prince. If the wielder does not proceed directly toward Orcus, Demonbane asks (it speaks Common and Draconic) to be handed over to a more dedicated warrior. If this fails, it attempts to control the PC (DC 27 Will save resists). A controlled PC follows Demonbane's directions and is allowed an additional saving throw every 24 hours.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +3 cold iron axiomatic keen bastard sword</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Rappan Athuk",
