      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>When the final fragment of the Kenabres wardstone shatters, a few tiny shards of the stone remain behind. The magic remaining in these fragments is fleeting, usable only once before the shard becomes an inert sliver of stone. As a standard action, a wardstone shard may be rubbed along a weapon or a suit of armor to transfer the shard's magic to the weapon or armor for 1 day.   Weapon: A weapon enhanced by a wardstone shard gains the evil outsider bane quality, and is treated as being made of cold iron and as a good weapon for the purposes of overcoming a demon's damage reduction. The shard cannot be used to enhance ammunition in this manner, but can be used to enhance a weapon that fires ammunition; doing so causes the weapon to impart these qualities to the ammunition as it is fired.   Armor: A suit of armor enhanced by a wardstone shard gains the spell resistance (13) armor special ability, but only against evil outsiders. Against demons, this spell resistance increases to 17. A nonmagical suit of armor also gains a +1 enhancement bonus as well.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 73",
