      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This adamantine quill pen is the greatest weapon Mephistopheles has in the corruption of souls. As a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, he can use it to inscribe a magic circle against good (or chaos), place a mark of justice, or pen an infernal contract. These contracts can grant any number of boons, but typically do so in the form of a wish spell or the devilbound template (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 56).  Visineir can be wielded as a +1 adamantine keen wounding dagger, but Mephistopheles rarely does so, preferring his trident in battle. The quill can store a sample of blood from every creature it strikes, storing up to 33 blood samples at a time. The quill gains the bane special ability against any creature whose blood it stores, and it marks the target as if Mephistopheles had used a witch's scar hexUM on it, allowing him to use his spell-like abilities on that creature with a range of 1 mile (or with unlimited range, if the creature is in Caina). Mephistopheles can expend one stored blood sample as a full-round action to inscribe a symbol spell of any type he wishes, or to call the creature to him as if he had cast greater planar binding (regardless of the creature's actual type-this is not limited to calling outsiders).<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +1 adamantine keen wounding dagger</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>PFRPG Bestiary 6",
