      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The cauldron of blood appears to be a normal cauldron forged of blackish-red iron. The true origins of this artifact have been lost over time. The cauldron of blood allows the user to view past or future events (similar to a divination or legend lore spell) by donating blood from his body to the boiling waters of the cauldron. To use this device, the user must bring water in the cauldron to a boil, and then bleed himself; allowing his fresh blood to drip into the boiling water. (This deals normal damage and temporary Constitution damage to the user based on how far in the past or future he wishes to look.) At this time, the user decides whether to view past or future events. The events can concern a person, place, or thing; they can be current or forgotten, or even information that is not yet known (see the divination spell). The cauldron functions for a maximum of 10 minutes before the visions disappear. Viewable Time Damage* Future/Past Fee** 2 30 minutes/6 months 50 gp 4 1 hour/1 year 100 gp 6 12 hours/20 years 500 gp 8 1 day/50 years 2000 gp 12 1 week/100 years 5000 gp in magic items 16 1 month/300 years 10,000 gp in magic items 20 1 year/500 years 20,000 gp in magic items *Damage is applied to both current hit points and Constitution. Both heal at the normal rate. Note that a user cannot bring his Constitution below 1 using the cauldron. The damage lost also represents the effective caster level of the cauldron to penetrate any magical wards against such scrying. **This base price excludes the blood/Con loss required to fuel the cauldron; the value listed is suggested as a starting point for bargaining. They go as low as 75% of this value if the negotiation is sufficiently skillful. Alternately, they may require in lieu of this fee that the PC fetch them a particular item, such as a lock of hair from a king's daughter, an enchanted lyre in the keeping of an ogre mage, or the skull of the Oracle of Rappan Athuk (see Level 3, Area 3-7).<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Rappan Athuk",
