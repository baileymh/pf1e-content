Wielded before that loss by Captain Tevenida Aiger-and rumored to have been given to her by Norgorber's herald as a reward for an unknown task- is said to have been a particularly potent weapon against outsiders. In addition to being a notorious pirate captain, Tevenida Aiger was a priestess of Norgorber, and her specialty was the capture of Chelish warships, particularly those employing devils or other extraplanar defenses. Some whisper that Captain Aiger and her sword vanished in the Black Tower due to a Chelish trap set in the structure, but in fact her fate was much grimmer than that (see Part Three of The Price of Infamy for details).  is a short sword of the planes (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 477). Three times per day, it can be used to cast dimensional anchor on a creature the sword has just struck- activating this effect is a swift action for the sword's wielder. If the strike is a critical hit, the effect gains a +10 bonus on its caster level check to penetrate the target's spell resistance, if any.  The weapon's greatest power, though, is its ability to destroy portals or seal planar rifts. Once per year, can be plunged into an extraplanar portal as a standard action-doing so immediately results in two effects. First, it targets the portal with a mage's disjunction (this effect lasts for as long as the sword remains in the portal). Second, as long as the sword remains lodged in the portal, it becomes affected by an antipathy effect against all outsiders. Once removed from a portal, it takes the sword a year to build up its magic to be able to use this ability again.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 59",
