      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This tarnished gold scepter's ends are shaped into sickly, withered-looking leaves. The scepter's rod has four slots, into which four large rings can be placed. Each ring is engraved with a phrase in Abyssal, and can be placed upon or removed from the scepter as a standard action.  Ring 1: Princess of the Blasted Heath.  Ring 2: Shall stand proud to station earned.  Ring 3: Moss and rot shall grow unchecked.  Ring 4: 'Til all hands bear the sin they've earned.  The corrupted Dryad's Song grants some limited control over the Darkblight. With a single ring, the bearer can cast entangle and wood shape each 3/ day. With two rings, the bearer can also cast blight, diminish plants, plant growth, and tree stride each 1/day. With three rings, the bearer can also cast black tentacles 1/day, animating the fungal matter in the area in lieu of creating extradimensional tendrils. With all four rings, the bearer can recite the full poem on the scepter as a full-round action to purge a single creature within 60 feet of the Darkblight's taint, as if she had successfully cast remove curse and remove disease-even removing the blighted fey template from a target creature (unwilling fey can resist this effect with a successful DC 28 Will save). All of these spell-like abilities affect only fungus and plants infected with the Darkblight.  A single ring on its own maintains some control over the Darkblight-reading a ring's phrase as a standard action grants the creature holding it and up to nine other creatures she can see immunity to Darkblight infestation for 1 hour. A single ring does nothing to reverse the effects of Darkblight already infesting a creature.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 119",
