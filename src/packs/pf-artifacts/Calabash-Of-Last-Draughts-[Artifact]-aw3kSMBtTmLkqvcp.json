      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>An elaborately carved stopper caps this black gourd. It was once a decanter of endless water, but the bottle's magic has been warped by the daemon spirit trapped within. The Calabash of Last Draughts can be slung over a creature's chest with its leather strap, and grants a +2 profane bonus to Intelligence when worn. Five times per day, the wearer can unstopper the bottle and splash a creature with the tainted water within as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet. A successful attack deals 1d4 points of Intelligence damage as the waters wipe away a creature's memories and sense of self. A successful DC 18 Will save reduces this Intelligence damage by half. If a target is helpless or willing, the wearer can instead unstopper the calabash and feed the target its tainted waters, either dealing 2d4 points of Intelligence damage or allowing the wearer to change or eliminate the target's memories as per the modify memory spell.  The Calabash of Last Draughts also erodes an outsider's connection to the physical world. If a possessing creature's Intelligence is reduced to 1 or lower in this way, it is immediately exorcised from its host's body.  Upon picking up the Calabash of Last Draughts, a creature must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or immediately drink from the accursed gourd.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Feast Of Dust",
