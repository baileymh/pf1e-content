      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The Lawgiver bestows this unique warhammer upon his greatest champion, typically a high priest or paladin, though warriors have been known to wield the weapon at times as well. The weapon currently sits deep underground, in a makeshift tomb of the last Champion of Thyr, a priest named Bofred. Thyr patiently bides his time, waiting for a new champion to rise up and claim the weapon. Thyr's Gavel is a +6 holy axiomatic cold iron warhammer. If the weapon is willingly picked up by an undead, evil outsider or chaotic outsider, that creature must make a DC 37 Will save or be slain (no additional save). If the creature is successful, a new save must be attempted every hour, and it still suffers from the negative levels imposed by the holy and axiomatic weapon properties. The wielder of Thyr's Gavel can cast daylight at will as a spell-like ability (CL 20th). If the wielder is a follower of Thyr, she may add her Charisma bonus (if any) to her armor class as a sacred bonus and to her saving throws as a luck bonus.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +6 holy axiomatic cold iron warhammer</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Rappan Athuk",
