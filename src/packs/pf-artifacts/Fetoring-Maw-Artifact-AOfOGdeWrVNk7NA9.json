      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>By holding this fist-sized, sickly green gem and concentrating for 1 hour, the bearer can create a sphere of poisonous fog centered in a location the bearer has seen that is within 1 mile of his current position. It must be centered on a geographical point, so it can't target a specific person, but it can surround that person if she is in the area the bearer targets. The sphere must be created around an area of  normal, safe air, of a size selected by the user when the sphere is created, between 100 feet and 1 mile in diameter. This thickness of the fog is always one-tenth the diameter of the safe area inside it, so a safe area 5,000 feet across is surrounded by a poisonous fog 500 feet thick. The sphere of fog seeps through earth and liquids, but it does not penetrate worked stone. No amount of wind can disperse the poisonous fog. The fetoring maw must remain within 10 miles of the center of the sphere, or the fog dissipates harmlessly.  The fetoring maw can create only one sphere of poisonous fog at a time, and once a sphere is created, the fetoring maw must recharge for 3 months before it can create another one. The creature that created a sphere can dismiss it as a move action while holding the gem, but the sphere otherwise lasts for 3 months or until the fetoring maw is destroyed, whichever comes first.  Any creature can pass through the poisonous fog of the sphere's walls, though it obscures vision as per fog cloud. The fog also includes poisonous vapors and bewildering mists, as described in The Fog Dome on page 5. The creature that created the sphere can touch the fetoring maw to the palm of a willing creature as a standard action, marking that target with a skull-shaped brand that renders it immune to the fetoring maw's poison and mind-affecting effects. A fetoring maw can mark up to 13 creatures in this manner every three months.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 140",
