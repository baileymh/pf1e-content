      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This jewel encrusted +3 longsword is made of an unbreakable, purplish metal engraved with twin crowns.  It contains the souls of both a demon and an angel. It is neutrally aligned. It can emit a blinding flash 1/day (DC 20 Fortitude save avoids blindness for 2d4 rounds to all within 30 ft., the sword wielder is not affected), and it has the ability to erase a sleeping creatures dreams 1/day (spellcasters may not recover spells, no natural daily healing is received, daily abilities are not recovered). It can cast find the path 1/week (to locate the Sword of Princes and Princesses only until found). Further, the sword gains the ability to cast the dream spell 1/week. The sword has an ego of 21, and an intelligence of 13. The major drawback to this sword is that it carries a curse and a geas.  This curse can only be removed by a miracle, wish or by the prescribed method. The curse attracts monsters and creates hostility towards non-neutral creatures; with triple normal chances of wandering monsters occurring while a being possesses the sword, and a -4 Cha modifier when determining actions of non-neutral creatures towards the wielder.  Magic runes inscribed on the blade read destroy me if a read magic is cast. If destroyed, this action frees both the demon and angel from the sword. Both then disappear. This lifts the curse from the owner. Better yet, the sword then reappears in the owner's possession (in a non-cursed state) the first time he is unarmed, disarmed, or in danger or combat and without a weapon. The owner does not know of this last effect until it actually happens.  The geas on this sword forces the owner to quest for what it considers its offspring, the Sword of Princes and Princesses, located on Level 12B, Area 12B-9. Its powers and description are listed here as well for reference.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Rappan Athuk",
