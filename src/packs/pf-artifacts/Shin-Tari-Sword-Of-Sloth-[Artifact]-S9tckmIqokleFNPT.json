      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>A scene of imperial decadences depicted in fantastically fine etchings-which seem to change upon each consideration- covers the surface of this +5 short sword. Every time Shin-Tari successfully damages a creature, it gains the bane weapon special ability, with the target's creature type being its designated foe. This additional weapon quality actives after the weapon first strikes an opponent, granting additional damage to subsequent attacks but not the first attack.   The bane weapon special ability persists for the rest of the day, or until the sword strikes a foe of a different creature type. Additionally, whenever Shin-Tari strikes a Large or smaller foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be affected as per the spell dimension door. This effect functions as the spell, but Shin-Tari's wielder determines where his opponent is transported to, and the destination must be within the wielder's line of sight. The wielder cannot teleport an opponent into a space occupied by another creature or a solid object. Only one creature can be affected by this ability each round, and the target can act as normal on its next turn. If the sword scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be affected by the spell teleport. The sword's wielder determines the destination, which must be very familiar to him.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +5 short sword</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Artifacts and Legends",
