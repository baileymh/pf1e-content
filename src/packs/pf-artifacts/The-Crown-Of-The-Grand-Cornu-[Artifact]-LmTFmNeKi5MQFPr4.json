      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This impressive headpiece is the undisputed symbol of the Grand Cornu. It is large and imposing, composed of fluted iron and black opals, and is worth 100,000 gp for its materials and workmanship alone.  In addition to being a badge of office, the crown acts as a headband of mental prowess, granting a +6 enhancement bonus to the wearer's Wisdom and Charisma scores. However, it also bears a terrible curse that strikes anyone who puts on the crown without having been sworn in as the Grand Cornu in an official ceremony in a major temple of Orcus.  Creatures that have the crown forced upon their head gain a DC 30 Will save to avoid the curse; those who willingly don the headpiece, however, receive no save.  The crown's curse immediately turn's the wearer's alignment to chaotic evil. The wearer's skin turns a darker shade, as if coated by a layer of shadows, and the irises of the eyes turn a smoky, roiling black.  In addition to the alignment change, the wearer becomes a devoted servant of Orcus, seeking to further the demon lord's cause in whatever way possible. Likely this involves first disposing of any allies! Removing or even destroying the helm does not lift this curse; it can only be removed by a good-aligned cleric of 16th level or higher.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Rappan Athuk",
