The garment was once a cloak of displacement, but the harbinger spirit trapped within has warped and twisted it- now it offers false hope rather than security. The Shroud of Flies grants its wearer a +2 profane bonus to Constitution and +4 resistance bonus on Reflex and Will saves, but imposes a -6 penalty on Fortitude saves against disease.  Three times per day, the wearer can brush another creature with the shawl to remove all lingering effects caused by a disease, poison, or curse, as per break enchantment, remove curse, or remove disease. These effects are not eliminated, and return immediately with all accrued penalties after 24 hours. Any creature embraced in this way must immediately succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or be infected with one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, cackle fever, devil chills, or leprosy. Any creature the wearer touches while offering medical aid, such as casting cure spells, administering a potion, or using the Heal skill, must likewise succeed at this Fortitude save or become infected.  The Shroud of Flies can be wielded as a net as well, but only against daemons. Any creature that has worn the shroud for at least 24 hours is considered proficient in its use as a weapon.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Feast Of Dust",
