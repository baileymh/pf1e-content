      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This crenellated gold coronet, decorated with jewels and etchings of lions, seems heavier in the hand than expected. A single roaring lion's head decorates the crown's front. The Primogen Crown grants its wearer a +5 resistance bonus on saving throws, a +5 deflection bonus to AC, immunity to mind-affecting effects, spell resistance equal to the wearer's CR + 11, a constant true seeing effect, and the ability to speak and be clearly heard by all sentient creatures within 1,000 feet. The crown also grants a +4 enhancement bonus to the wearer's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores (with ranks in Knowledge [history] and Knowledge [nobility] as well as the ability to speak and read Azlanti and Celestial, as per a headband of vast intelligence). Once per day, the wearer of the Primogen Crown can cast the following as spell-like abilities (CL 20th): banishment, control weather, and greater dispel magic.  The Primogen Crown must be bonded to its wearer in a coronation ceremony in the Imperial Palace of Taldor to access its full power. Without this ceremony, the crown does not grant its wearer any spell-like abilities, spell resistance, bonus to AC, immunity to mind-affecting abilities, or bonus to mental attributes-only the +5 resistance bonus on saving throws. Once bonded to the crown, the wearer cannot knowingly speak or write a lie while wearing the Primogen Crown.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 127",
