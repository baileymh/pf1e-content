      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Most bags of devouring appear to be normal sacks, but Chomper is unlike most bags of devouring. Sporting rows of vicious teeth, a bad attitude, and a thirst to devour all things, this intelligent cursed item believes that it is the favored maw and most important appendage of a creature it mysteriously refers to as the Eater of All. Chomper hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred spirits of destruction.   Chomper has all of the magical abilities of a regular bag of devouring, along with the following additional powers.   • As a standard action, Chomper's possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any single creature or unattended item within a 5-foot radius. Chomper (not the wielder) can then make a single bite attack against the target. This bite has a +14 attack bonus and deals 1d10+5 points of damage plus 2 points of bleed damage. This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder's abilities.   • When a non-demon is in possession of Chomper, the bag's cursed aura imparts a -1 penalty on all of its wielder's attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If Chomper manages to gain dominance over a non-demon wielder through a personality conflict, it directs its bearer to seek out victims to feed to it.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Ultimate Equipment",
