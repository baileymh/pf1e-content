      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Nine times per day, the bearer of the Scepter of Alaznist can empower, expand, or maximize a spell she casts as though she were using a greater empower metamagic rod,  greater expand metamagic rod, or greater maximize metamagic rod, except that she can simultaneously apply two or all three of these metamagic effects to the same spell, expending two or three of the scepter's daily uses, respectively. Each daily use spent when casting a spell lowers the DC of the spell by 2 (to a maximum reduction of 6); however, this reduction doesn't apply to evocation spells.  The scepter also functions as a +5 adamantine light mace. When the wielder hits a creature, the wielder can cast a single targeted spell of up to 3rd level on the creature, as spell-storing weapon, by expending one of the scepter's daily uses as a swift action. The spell cast can't be empowered, extended, or maximized by the Scepter of Alaznist, but its DC isn't lowered for a daily use expended this way.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 137",
