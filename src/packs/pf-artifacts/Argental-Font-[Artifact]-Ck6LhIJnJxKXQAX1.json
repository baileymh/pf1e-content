      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This beautifully carved stone fountain is decorated with figures of dancing fey creatures and holds pure, shimmering water that glows with silvery light.  The moon-goddess Acavna gave the to the city of Saventh-Yhi at its founding as a gift in gratitude for the heroine Savith's valor. Anyone drinking from the fountain enjoys the combined benefits of greater restoration and heal, and is immediately cured of all afflictions, including ability damage or drain, negative levels, and insanities. The waters cannot return the dead to life, though an undead creature immersed in the fountain is immediately destroyed (no save).  The fountain never runs dry, no matter how many times it is used or how much water is taken from it, but the water retains its potency for only 1 round after being removed from the fountain, becoming normal water thereafter. The font can only be moved from its location with a miracle or wish spell. An individual creature can only benefit from the effects of the Argental Font once per year.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 40",
