      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for magical properties makes it seem as if it were a bag of holding. The sack, however, is something entirely different and more insidious-one of the feeding orifices of an extradimensional creature.   Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to swallowing'' if thrust within the bag. The bag of devouring is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but anytime thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close around the offending appendage and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple. If it pins a creature, it pulls the victim inside as a free action. The bag has a CMD of 18 for those attempting to break free.   The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a bag of holding type I, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Ultimate Equipment",
