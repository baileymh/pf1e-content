Worse, you always seem to have debts looming over your head. When you heard about the &ldquo;Cheat the Devil and Take His Gold&rdquo; gambling tournament, you felt in your gut that your luck was about to change. You&rsquo;ve always been optimistic, in fact, and even though right now is one of those rare times where you don&rsquo;t owe anyone any money (you just paid off a recent loan from local moneylender Lymas Smeed), you know that&rsquo;ll change soon enough. Better to start amassing money now when you&rsquo;re at one of those rare windfall times! You&rsquo;ve set aside a gold coin for the entrance fee, and look forward to making it big&mdash;you can feel it in your bones! This time&rsquo;s gonna be the big one! Your boundless optimism, even in the face of crushing situations, has always bolstered your spirit.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Effects that grant you morale bonuses persist 1d4 rounds longer than they normally would as a result.</span></p>",
