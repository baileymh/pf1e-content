You aren&rsquo;t seeking revenge against gnolls, glory, money, or anything else&mdash;to you, this is purely a matter of honor, as Kelmarane is where you were born. Your were forced to flee the village when you were only a few years old, and you didn&rsquo;t discoverer this until a few years ago&mdash;perhaps you found an old document that revealed the truth, or maybe you learned the news from a relative. Both of your parents are now dead, and from what you&rsquo;ve been able to piece together, one of your parents actually died in the village when whatever happened there happened.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Your surviving parent spirited you away to safety to grow up elsewhere, but never spoke of Kelmarane and always told you that your other parent died when you were a child in a horrific tragedy like a fire or a flood that swept away the body. Now that you&rsquo;ve started to uncover the truth, you are convinced that your heritage remains hidden in Kelmarane. Whether you just wish to find out what really happened to your parent that died there or you want to rebuild the village in his or her honor is up to you&mdash;but Garavel&rsquo;s caravan to the village is just the opportunity you&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">When your other parent died recently, among his or her effects was a single item that once belonged to the parent who died at Kelmarane. This item is your most valued possession&mdash;a piece of jewelry worth 350 gp, any masterwork weapon or armor worth no more than 350 gp, or a wand containing any 1st-level spell (CL 1st) with only 20 charges remaining. If you ever lose this item, your resulting depression imposes a &ndash;1 penalty on Will saves for 1 year.</span></p>",
