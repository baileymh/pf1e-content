      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">The Pathfinder Society has long intrigued you&mdash;tales of the exotic lands and strange discoveries made by Pathfinders have enchanted your dreams and fired your imagination since childhood. When Pathfinders came through your village or neighborhood, they immediately enthralled you with their stories and knowledge. Yet at the time, you were far too young to join them, and when they left for adventure you had to stay behind. Now that you are of age, you&rsquo;ve traveled to Absalom to apply for membership. The application process went well, and you&rsquo;re now a full member.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Your first assignment is to accompany Garavel&rsquo;s group to Kelmarane&mdash;the Pathfinder Society has heard rumors of several ancient structures in the area, including a ruined monastery once dedicated to Sarenrae, and would like to learn more about them. Even more pressing is the mystery of what brought about Kelmarane&rsquo;s ruin in the first place&mdash;reports of which are vague at best. If you can determine the cause of the village&rsquo;s abandonment so many years ago, you&rsquo;re sure the Society would be impressed.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You begin the game with your own <em>wayfinder</em>, a loan from your venture-captain. You&rsquo;ve promised to pay your venturecaptain 500 gp for the <em>wayfinder</em> some day, but for now it&rsquo;s yours to use. A <em>wayfinder</em> is a magical compass that grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost, and can be commanded to emit light as the spell (CL 5th) as a standard action. Further details on the Pathfinder Society and <em>wayfinders</em> may be found in the <em>Pathfinder Chronicles Campaign Setting</em> (pages 194&ndash;195) or <em>Seekers of Secrets</em>.</span></p>",
