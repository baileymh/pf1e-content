Some of those masters were cruel, others kindly. In all cases, you&rsquo;ve yearned to be free. When your most recent master fell on hard times, he sold many of his slaves to the city government, and as luck would have it, a recent opportunity to earn your freedom has manifested. The Pactmasters of Katapesh are looking to revitalize an old trade route to Osirion, and a band of mercenaries and guards is gathering to go out and supplement forces already in place near the ruined village of Kelmarane, now said to be infested by gnolls. You&rsquo;ve secured a place among those mercenaries, under the watchful eye of Garavel. If you help in retaking Kelmarane, you&rsquo;ve been promised your freedom. In any event, your life as a slave has toughened you and made you more resistant to hardship.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Choose one of the three categories of saving throw; you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws of that type.</span></p>",
