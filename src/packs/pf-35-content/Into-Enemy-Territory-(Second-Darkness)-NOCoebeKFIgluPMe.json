It&rsquo;s certainly come to the attention of several druids, rangers, and other rural folk who dwell in the nearby mountains, forests, and swamps&mdash;among them, yourself. You&rsquo;ve consulted with several seers and Harrowers, and may even have performed some simple auguries yourself, and all the signs point the same way&mdash;something or someone in Riddleport is connected to the blot, and it means bad news for the region. You&rsquo;ve avoided the sleazy, dirty town for most of your life, traveling there only when absolutely necessary, and although you don&rsquo;t relish the prospect of going there now, you see little other choice (especially if one of your superiors is ordering you to go investigate).</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Fortunately, an eccentric friend of yours (pick another PC) is in town, and you&rsquo;ve heard this friend will be taking part in some gambling thing at a place called the Gold Goblin. Your friend&rsquo;s always had better luck interacting with the cityfolk, so you&rsquo;ve decided to accompany your friend to this gambling tournament and plan on letting him find a safe place for you to stay while you&rsquo;re in town. Your long life of self-sustenance has toughened you and made you more resistant to hardship, in any event&mdash;pick one of the three categories of saving throw. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws of that type.</span></p>",
