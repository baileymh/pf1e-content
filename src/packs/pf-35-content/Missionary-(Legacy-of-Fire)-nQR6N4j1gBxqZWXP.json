      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You&rsquo;ve spent much of the last several years serving your faith, and the conviction and dedication to your church has impressed many. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve donated much of your personal wealth or time to serving the church, or you&rsquo;re the child of a powerful or well-loved member of the church, an orphan raised by the church, or a foundling with a strange birthmark that bears more than a passing resemblance to your faith&rsquo;s holy symbol. The faith has long supported you, and you are eager to repay the church in some way. In Katapesh, the establishment of a new village is always cause for interest to the nation&rsquo;s churches, as establishing new temples in villages is an excellent way to expand upon the church&rsquo;s resources and bring in more faithful. If the Pactmasters&rsquo; plans to revitalize and rebuild Kelmarane are successful, the village will need a temple, and your faith is keenly interested in being represented there.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">This campaign trait is particularly suited to worshipers of Sarenrae, as Kelmarane was founded near an old monastery dedicated to the Dawnflower, and reconsecrating that monastery is of great interest to Sarenrae&rsquo;s church. Furthermore, a temple dedicated to her once stood in Kelmarane itself, but it has long since fallen into ruin; whispers among the religion tell that the church&rsquo;s old pastor may have fallen from grace and may even have been part of the cause of the hard times that befell the village.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You&rsquo;ve joined Garavel&rsquo;s band in hopes of helping to establish a new temple in the soon-to-be revitalized village. You&rsquo;ve been selected for your dedication to the church and your strong social graces&mdash;pick one of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Knowledge (religion), Perform (any), or Sense Motive. You gain a +1 trait bonus on checks using that skill, and it is always considered a class skill for you.</span></p>",
