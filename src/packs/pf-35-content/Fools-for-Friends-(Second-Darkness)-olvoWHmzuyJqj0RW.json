      "value": "<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You don&rsquo;t think of yourself as a gambler. In fact, you rather detest the whole thing. Unfortunately, one or more of your friends (pick one or more of the other players&rsquo; characters) doesn&rsquo;t think so, and you&rsquo;ve recently learned that friend&mdash;or friends&mdash;have decided to go to the Gold Goblin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cheat the Devil and Take his Gold&rdquo; tournament. Which pretty much means you have to go as well, since if no one&rsquo;s there to watch out for them, they&rsquo;ll lose all their money and respect. Again. Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard being the responsible one. Your devotion to your friendships (even when said friends seem, at times, to be trying to test that devotion) is a point of pride to you.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">Whenever you take the Aid Another action to help an ally, or whenever an ally aids you in this manner, a successful check grants an additional +1 trait bonus to the check for which aid was being rendered. Additionally, as long as one of your friends is within 30 feet, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against charm and compulsion effects.</span></p>",
