You arrived in town several days ago and had some issues with security and safety at several inns before you finally settled on the Gold Goblin; you&rsquo;ve been staying there as a guest for several days now, and the owner, Saul Vancaskerkin, seems like a nice guy.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">He&rsquo;s even given you a pass to attend the gambling tournament he&rsquo;s about to throw&mdash;you&rsquo;re not sure how into gambling you&rsquo;ll be, but perhaps there&rsquo;ll be some visitors from out of town you can talk to about the strange shadow in the sky. At the very least, you&rsquo;re hoping someone at the tourney will be into magic&mdash;there&rsquo;s not really enough folk in this town who seem all that interested in magic, you&rsquo;ve found. Your interest in magic dates back quite far, and as a result, you&rsquo;ve developed a knack for identifying common magical items at a glance.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You can use Spellcraft to identify magic items in the same way you can use Spellcraft to identify a potion. The DC to identify a magic item is equal to 20 + the item&rsquo;s caster level.</span></p>",
