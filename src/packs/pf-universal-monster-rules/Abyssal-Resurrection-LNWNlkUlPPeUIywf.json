      "value": "<p>A demon lord rules an Abyssal realm, a vast world that not only serves as its home but provides it with power. If a demon lord is slain, its body rapidly melts into corruption (leaving behind any gear it held or carried), its soul returns to a hidden location within its realm, and it is immediately restored to life (as <a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; background-image: none; background-color: initial; padding: 0px; color: #ff6400; border: none;\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"pf1.spells\" data-id=\"mxqi375ya2rka7cp\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; text-decoration-line: underline;\">true resurrection</span></a>) at that location. Once this occurs, a demon lord can&rsquo;t use this ability again until a full year has passed.</p>\n<p>A demon lord realizes it is vulnerable during this time and usually doesn&rsquo;t risk further battles for the remainder of that year, relying on the defenses of its realm and its legions of minions to protect it.</p>\n<p>A demon lord that is slain again during this year or is killed by unusual methods (such as by a true deity or an artifact created for this purpose) is slain forever&mdash;its remains appearing somewhere deep in the Abyss among other dead demon lords from the ages. A demon lord who does not control a domain does not gain this ability.</p>",
