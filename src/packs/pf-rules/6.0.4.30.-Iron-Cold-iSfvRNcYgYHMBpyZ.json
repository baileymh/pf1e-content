Weapons made of cold iron cost twice as much to make as their normal counterparts. Also, adding any magical enhancements to a cold iron weapon increases its price by 2,000 gp. This increase is applied the first time the item is enhanced, not once per ability added.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Items without metal parts cannot be made from cold iron. An arrow could be made of cold iron, but a quarterstaff could not. A double weapon with one cold iron half costs 50% more than normal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cold iron has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.</p>"
