Description of Spellblights}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 94</em></p>\n<p>GMs may choose to include the following methods of acquiring spellblights.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Antimagic Field</h2>\n<p>The first time a spellcaster attempts to cast a spell within an antimagic field, there is a chance she will spontaneously gain a major spellblight. The caster must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15 + the caster level of the antimagic field or DC 23 if there is no caster level for the effect).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Arcane Spell Failure</h2>\n<p>When a spellcaster fails an arcane failure check by rolling a 5% (a roll of 01&ndash;05 on the spell failure roll) or lower, she has a chance of becoming afflicted with a spellblight. The failed spellcaster must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 15 + the spell&rsquo;s level) or gain a spellblight. A failed spell of 4th level or lower results in a minor spellblight, while a failed spell of 5th level or higher results in a major spellblight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crafting Magic Items</h2>\n<p>When a spellcaster is crafting a magic item, and fails the skill check to create the item, the GM can choose to give the caster a spellblight instead of having that check result in a cursed item. Determine the spellblight randomly based on the caster level of the item she was attempting to create. Creating an item with a caster level of 10 or lower gives a random minor spellblight, while creating an item of caster level 11 or higher gives a random major spellblight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Turning</h2>\n<p>When a spellcaster is warded with a spell turning, and so is the creature he or she attacks, such occurrences usually create a resonance field as described in the spell&rsquo;s description. Instead, the spellcaster who cast the original effect can choose not to create the resonance field and both spellcasters are affected by a major spellblight. The spell that triggered the resonance field drains away without effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Teleportation Mishap</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster who casts a teleportation spell that results in a teleportation mishap has a chance of gaining a spellblight. The spellcaster who cast the teleportation spell must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15 + the spell level of the teleport) or gain a major spellblight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Use Magic Device</h2>\n<p>When a spellcaster rolls a natural 1 while attempting to use a magic device with the Use Magic Device skill, she can choose to risk gaining a minor spellblight instead of not being able to activate the item for 24 hours (Will negates DC 10 + item&rsquo;s caster level).</p>"
