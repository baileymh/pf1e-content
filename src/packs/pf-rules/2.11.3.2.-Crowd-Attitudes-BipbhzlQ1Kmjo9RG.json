Affecting the Crowd's Attitude}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 153</em></p>\n<p>While combatants do the actual fighting in performance combat, the crowd remains an active participant in these bouts. The audience can bolster or demoralize the competitors with their enthusiasm or scorn for what they see on the battlefield, with serious results.</p>\n<p>A crowd&rsquo;s attitude is similar to a nonplayer character&rsquo;s attitude when a character uses the Diplomacy skill. The DC of performance combat checks to improve crowd reaction is tied to the crowd&rsquo;s starting or current attitude. Each time the combatants do something spectacular on the battlefield, they have the opportunity to parlay that success into a better crowd reaction, but missteps can also create contempt among the crowd.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During performance combat, it is important for the GM to keep track of the crowd&rsquo;s attitude toward each side of the combat. Given that a crowd is filled with many people shouting, clapping, booing, hissing, or otherwise showing their pleasure or displeasure, the exact crowd reaction changes from moment to moment based on events on the battlefield, but groups of combatants always have a reasonable idea of what the crowd thinks of their performance at any given time.</p>\n<p>The following are the general categories of crowd reaction and attitude. They are listed from lowest regard to highest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hostile</h2>\n<p>The crowd does not like what it is seeing. Hostile crowds demoralize combatants in a performance combat. In these battles, while the crowd is hostile toward a given side, those combatants take a &ndash;2 penalty on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p>If the crowd is hostile toward a side of the combat and a member of that side fails a performance combat check by 5 or more, that side automatically loses the performance part of the combat. This can be important for the story of the game, or if the PCs are participating in serialized performance combats.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Unfriendly</h2>\n<p>While still biased against a side, the crowd reserves its most vocal disdain for failed performance combat checks. Unfriendly crowds demoralize combatants in a performance combat. In these battles, while the crowd is unfriendly toward a given side, those combatants take a &ndash;1 penalty on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Indifferent</h2>\n<p>The crowd is waiting for something exciting to happen. Audience members show little emotion other than anticipation and a desire for daring feats of combat to occur.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Friendly</h2>\n<p>The crowd is beginning to be swayed toward one side in the fray. Audience members cheer when that side achieves some impressive feat in the combat, and their reaction grants a +1 morale bonus on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for their chosen side. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Helpful</h2>\n<p>The crowd loves what it is seeing from a given side. Audience members stand up, chant, cheer, and scream for the combatants to push on toward ultimate success. A helpful crowd grants its chosen champions a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p>If the crowd is helpful toward one side of the combat and a member of that side succeeds at a performance combat check, that side gains a victory point.</p>"
