Such weapons overcome every demon&rsquo;s natural resistances, and are one of the few types of weapons that all demons fear equally. When dealing with demons, it is best to remember that they abide by no contract other than power, and displaying power&mdash;or at least hints of it&mdash;is key to keeping them under control. Their magic circle is made of powdered cold iron.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All demons are immune to electricity and poison effects. Many have other resistances based on their forms and chaotic natures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Babau (SR 17)</h2>\n<p>Any sacrifice for a babau must involve an intelligent creature, which the demon must be allowed to rend and utterly destroy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Balor (SR 31)</h2>\n<p>Balors do not come when summoned, and actively resist calls. Only the offer of a bound CR 15 lawful or good outsider, or a helpless paladin or cleric of 15th level or higher, dims their rage at being snatched from their home. Even thus placated, they will surely seek revenge unless the mortal they face demonstrates a greater power.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dretch</h2>\n<p>As the slave labor of the infinite Abyss, the lot of the dretch would be pitiable if the creature weren&rsquo;t so contemptible. The best sacrifice for a dretch is the promise that it can spend at least a third of its time in servitude resting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Glabrezu (SR 24)</h2>\n<p>These treacherous demons peddle in secrets that destroy, and to bring them to the Material Plane as interested negotiators, the caster must know secrets that can destroy influential families, bring down nations, or otherwise befoul the bedrock of society.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hezrou (SR 22)</h2>\n<p>Expensive poisons and powerful potions worth at least 500 gp can pique the interest of these toadlike demons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Marilith (SR 28)</h2>\n<p>Either powerful magic weapons (+2 enchantment or greater) or the promise of the command of armies of cults can lure a marilith; any offer less than this earns the caster a &ndash;6 penalty on the Charisma check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Kalavakus (SR 21)</h2>\n<p>These horned demons almost always barter for slaves in return of their services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nabasu (SR 19)</h2>\n<p>These demons love nothing more than devouring or enslaving humanoids so they can grow fatter and stronger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nalfeshnee (SR 25)</h2>\n<p>These demons love knowledge, especially that within their specialties of manipulation and greed. Nalfeshnees bargain knowledge for knowledge, but never give more than they gain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Omox (SR 23)</h2>\n<p>These slimy demons enjoy the destruction of beautiful things. For their services, they often take &ldquo;gifts&rdquo; that involve the destruction of beautiful things&mdash;in particular an attractive young man or woman as sacrifice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Quasit</h2>\n<p>Even more pathetic than the dretch, the quasit seeks only the assurance that it can return to the Abyss when its task is complete.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shadow Demon (SR 17)</h2>\n<p>The shadow demon asks merely for the shell of a beautiful person to wear for the duration of its servitude. It does not care whether that shell is pure or impure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shemhazian (SR 27)</h2>\n<p>These powerful demons serve mortal spellcasters for only one price&mdash;when their service is done, they get to kill and devour the binder. This makes attempts to control them very rare. Sometimes they demand the life of the binder&rsquo;s family or friends as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Succubus (SR 18)</h2>\n<p>The primary joy of the succubus is in destroying innocence and love; offering a child, virgin, or a beloved family member of the caster suffices to gain the interest of the succubus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vrock (SR 20)</h2>\n<p>The vrock loves to despoil and befoul things of great beauty. Artwork worth at least 250 gp or a living, intelligent creature to destroy are equally desirable sacrifices. As their dance of ruin attack is more powerful the more vrocks are involved, they are often conjured and bribed in groups.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vrolikai (SR 30)</h2>\n<p>These transformed nabasus hate being summoned to the Material Plane, believing their time there is over and they are meant for greater things. When summoned, they typically ask for twice the normal amount in gifts. These demands are often accompanied by outrageous, sometimes impossible demands. They can eventually be reasoned with, but only when binders demonstrate power over them.</p>"
