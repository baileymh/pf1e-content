City Lights}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 435</em></p>\n<p>Typical city streets are narrow and twisting. Most streets average 15 to 20 feet wide, while alleys range from 10 feet wide to only 5 feet. Cobblestones in good condition allow normal movement, but roads in poor repair and heavily rutted dirt streets are considered light rubble, increasing the DC of Acrobatics checks by 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some cities have no larger thoroughfares, particularly cities that gradually grew from small settlements to larger cities. Cities that are planned, or perhaps have suffered a major fire that allowed authorities to construct new roads through formerly inhabited areas, might have a few larger streets through town. These main roads are 25 feet wide&mdash;offering room for wagons to pass each other&mdash;with 5-foot-wide sidewalks on either side.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crowds</h2>\n<p>Urban streets are often full of people going about their daily lives. In most cases, it isn&rsquo;t necessary to put every 1st-level commoner on the map when a fight breaks out on the city&rsquo;s main thoroughfare. Instead, just indicate which squares on the map contain crowds. If crowds see something obviously dangerous, they&rsquo;ll move away at 30 feet per round at initiative count 0. It takes 2 squares of movement to enter a square with crowds. The crowds provide cover for anyone who does so, enabling a Stealth check and providing a bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Directing Crowds</h2>\n<p>It takes a DC 15 Diplomacy check or DC 20 Intimidate check to convince a crowd to move in a particular direction, and the crowd must be able to hear or see the character making the attempt. It takes a full-round action to make the Diplomacy check, but only a free action to make the Intimidate check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If two or more characters are trying to direct a crowd in different directions, they make opposed Diplomacy or Intimidate checks to determine to whom the crowd listens. The crowd ignores everyone if none of the characters&rsquo; check results beat the DCs given above.</p>"
