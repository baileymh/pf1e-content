Instead of channeling heat away from the wearer, it channels heat toward the wearer. Frost-forged steel works similarly to fire-forged steel, except its effects apply to cold damage rather than fire damage. This means frost-forged steel weapons are less useful than their fire-forged counterparts, as there are few nonmagical sources of cold that can quickly imbue it with enough cold energy to deal bonus damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Armor and weapons made from frost-forged steel are always considered masterwork, and the masterwork costs are included in the listed prices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Frost-forged steel has the same hit points and hardness as steel. Frost-forged steel costs the same as fire-forged steel.</p>"
