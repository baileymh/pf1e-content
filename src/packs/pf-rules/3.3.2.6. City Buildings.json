The majority of buildings in the city are two to five stories high, built side-by-side to form long rows separated by secondary or main streets. These row houses usually have businesses on the ground floor, with offices or apartments above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Inns, successful businesses, and large warehouses&mdash;as well as millers, tanners, and other businesses that require extra space&mdash;are generally large, free-standing buildings with up to five stories.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, small residences, shops, warehouses, or storage sheds are simple, one-story wooden buildings, especially if they&rsquo;re in poorer neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most city buildings are made of a combination of stone or clay brick (on the lower one or two stories) and timbers (for the upper stories, interior walls, and floors). Roofs are a mixture of boards, thatch, and slates, sealed with pitch. A typical lower-story wall is 1 foot thick, with AC 3, hardness 8, 90 hp, and a Climb DC of 25. Upper-story walls are 6 inches thick, with AC 3, hardness 5, 60 hp, and a Climb DC of 21. Exterior doors on most buildings are good wooden doors that are usually kept locked, except on public buildings such as shops and taverns.</p>"
