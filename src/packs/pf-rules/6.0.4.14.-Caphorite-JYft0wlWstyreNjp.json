This radioactive mineral emits a magical radiation that registers a faint aura of transmutation magic to detect magic, though caphorite itself has no magical qualities and no effective caster level. Living creatures suffer no ill effects from caphorite radiation; however, plants exposed to caphorite radiation tend to grow more quickly, and with long-term exposure (over the course of several generations), they sometimes develop rudimentary sentience. Additionally, anyone attempting to cast a spell with the light descriptor within 30 feet of caphorite must succeed at a DC 15 caster level check or have the spell disrupted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Caphorite Ammunition</h2>\n<p>This ammunition typically consists of crossbow bolts, often employed by drow house guards. A caphorite arrow or bolt detonates on impact, its head shattering in a mass of fine caphorite particulate. Any nonmagical light in a 10-foot radius is immediately extinguished, while spells of 2nd level or lower with the light descriptor are rendered inactive for 1d4+1 rounds. Higher-level spells with the light descriptor are unaffected. Caphorite ammunition has a cost of +10 gp per item.</p>"
