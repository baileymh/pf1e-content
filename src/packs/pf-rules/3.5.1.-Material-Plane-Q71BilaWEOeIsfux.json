How Planes Interact}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 440</em></p>\n<p>The Material Plane tends to be the most Earth-like of all planes and operates under the same set of natural laws that our own real world does. The &ldquo;size&rdquo; of the Material Plane depends upon the campaign&mdash;it might conform only to the single world on which your game is set, or it might encompass an entire universe of planets, moons, stars, and galaxies. The Material Plane is the default plane for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Planar Traits</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>GameMastery Guide pg. 188</em></p>\n<p>The Material Plane is the center of most cosmologies and defines what is considered normal. It is the plane most campaign worlds occupy.</p>\n<p>The Material Plane has the following traits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Normal Gravity</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Normal Time</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Alterable Morphic</strong></li>\n<li><strong>No Elemental or Energy Traits</strong>: Specific locations may have these traits, however.</li>\n<li><strong>Mildly Neutral-Aligned</strong>: Though it may contain high concentrations of evil or good, law or chaos in places.</li>\n<li><strong>Normal Magic</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Occult Adventures pg. 240</em></p>\n<p>The Material Plane is the realm of physical sensation and incarnate existence. Souls manifest here in the shell of a physical body, a union so complete that most living creatures do not spend much time contemplating the difference between the gross physical form and the higher monadic soul that guides its movements and destiny. The final destination of a soul is not yet determined during its mortal life, making the Material Plane a magnet for the attentions of gods and outsiders eager to rally mortals to their banners in the afterlife, either willingly or by force. A planar crossroads, the Material Plane is coexistent with the Ethereal and Shadow Planes and coterminous with all of the realms of the Inner Sphere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just as little-known forces bind a physical body to its astral and ethereal counterparts, the whole of the universe is bound together by a series of ley lines&mdash; spiritual conduits that interpenetrate the many planes of the multiverse. Ley lines are prevalent on the Material Plane, and wise adepts of the occult arts, canny students of the arcane, and even village witches learn to recognize and manipulate these forces to their own ends. Some believe that one of the most prominent of these ley lines is the so-called &ldquo;River of Souls&rdquo; that guides a monad&rsquo;s spiritual journey through mortal incarnation and the afterlife, but that is just one aspect of this multiversal arterial network.</p>"
