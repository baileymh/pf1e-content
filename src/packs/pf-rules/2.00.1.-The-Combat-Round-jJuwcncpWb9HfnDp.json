A round normally allows each character involved in a combat situation to act.</p>\n<p>Each round&rsquo;s activity begins with the character with the highest initiative result and then proceeds in order. When a character&rsquo;s turn comes up in the initiative sequence, that character performs his entire round&rsquo;s worth of actions. (For exceptions, see Attacks of Opportunity and Special Initiative Actions.)</p>\n<p>When the rules refer to a \"full round\", they usually mean a span of time from a particular initiative count in one round to the same initiative count in the next round. Effects that last a certain number of rounds end just before the same initiative count that they began on.</p>"
