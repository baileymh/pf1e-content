Winds}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 438</em></p>\n<p>The combined effects of precipitation (or dust) and wind that accompany all storms reduce visibility ranges by three-quarters, imposing a &ndash;8 penalty on Perception checks. Storms make ranged weapon attacks impossible, except for those using siege weapons, which have a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls. They automatically extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. They cause protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and have a 50% chance to extinguish these lights. See Table 13&ndash;10 for possible consequences to creatures caught outside without shelter during such a storm. Storms are divided into the following three types.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Duststorm (CR 3)</h2>\n<p>These desert storms differ from other storms in that they have no precipitation. Instead, a duststorm blows fine grains of sand that obscure vision, smother unprotected flames, and can even choke protected flames (50% chance). Most duststorms are accompanied by severe winds and leave behind a deposit of 1d6 inches of sand. There is a 10% chance for a greater duststorm to be accompanied by windstorm-magnitude winds (see Table 13&ndash;10). These greater duststorms deal 1d3 points of nonlethal damage each round to anyone caught out in the open without shelter and also pose a choking hazard (see Drowning, except that a character with a scarf or similar protection across her mouth and nose does not begin to choke until after a number of rounds equal to 10 + her Constitution score). Greater duststorms leave 2d3&ndash;1 feet of fine sand in their wake.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Snowstorm</h2>\n<p>In addition to the wind and precipitation common to other storms, snowstorms leave 1d6 inches of snow on the ground afterward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Thunderstorm</h2>\n<p>In addition to wind and precipitation (usually rain, but sometimes also hail), thunderstorms are accompanied by lightning that can pose a hazard to characters without proper shelter (especially those in metal armor). As a rule of thumb, assume one bolt per minute for a 1-hour period at the center of the storm. Each bolt causes between 4d8 and 10d8 points of electricity damage. One in 10 thunderstorms is accompanied by a tornado.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Powerful Storms</h2>\n<p>Very high winds and torrential precipitation reduce visibility to zero, making Perception checks and all ranged weapon attacks impossible. Unprotected flames are automatically extinguished, and protected flames have a 75% chance of being doused. Creatures caught in the area must make a Fortitude save or face the effects based on the size of the creature (see Table 13&ndash;10). Powerful storms are divided into the following four types.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Windstorm</h2>\n<p>While accompanied by little or no precipitation, windstorms can cause considerable damage simply through the force of their winds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Blizzard</h2>\n<p>The combination of high winds, heavy snow (typically 1d3 feet), and bitter cold make blizzards deadly for all who are unprepared for them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hurricane</h2>\n<p>In addition to very high winds and heavy rain, hurricanes are accompanied by floods. Most adventuring activity is impossible under such conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Tornado</h2>\n<p>In addition to incredibly high winds, tornadoes can severely injure and kill those that get pulled into their funnels.</p>"
