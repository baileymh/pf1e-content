If an attack with a piercing or slashing blood crystal weapon hits a target suffering from a bleed effect, the creature takes 1 additional point of damage from the attack as the blood crystal drains blood from the wound. This applies even if the creature was taking bleed damage before the attack with the blood crystal weapon. This does not increase the amount of the bleed effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfed blood crystal has a pale pink hue, darkening toward deep crimson as it becomes saturated with blood. Piercing or slashing weapons composed entirely or partially of metal can be made from blood crystal. Unworked blood crystal has a value of 500 gp per pound. Weapons made with blood crystal have one-half the normal hit points. Armor and shields cannot be made of blood crystal, as they would feed on the wearer&rsquo;s own wounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Blood crystal has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 47.7232%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.0686%;\" scope=\"col\">Type of Blood Crystal Item</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.2109%;\" scope=\"col\">Item Price Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.0686%;\">Ammunition</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.2109%;\">+30 gp per item</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 52.0686%;\">Weapon</td>\n<td style=\"width: 47.2109%;\">+1,500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
