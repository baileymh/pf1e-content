If you roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character you&rsquo;re helping gets a +2 bonus on his or her check. (You can&rsquo;t take 10 on a skill check to aid another.) In many cases, a character&rsquo;s help won&rsquo;t be beneficial, or only a limited number of characters can help at once.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results, such as trying to open a lock using Disable Device, you can&rsquo;t aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character couldn&rsquo;t achieve alone. The GM might impose further restrictions to aiding another on a case-by-case basis as well.</p>"
