Their dexterity is usually poor to average, though exceptionally nimble constructs do exist. Nearly all constructs of size Medium or larger have high Strength scores; constructs never have a Constitution score.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The monster creation rules in the Bestiary serve as your best guide for designing a new construct. New constructs should stick fairly close to the Monster Statistics by CR table found on page 291 of the Bestiary or the expanded table on page 293 of Bestiary 2. As they are usually mindless combat brutes, most use the &ldquo;high attack&rdquo; column, with damage falling in between the High and Low average damage columns. Note that all the construct&rsquo;s saving throws are likely to be poor, and they have no favored saves. Lacking a Constitution score, a construct&rsquo;s hit points also tend to be low in comparison to creatures with similar CRs. Consider giving any construct that doesn&rsquo;t have either damage reduction or hardness a higher AC to compensate.</p>"
