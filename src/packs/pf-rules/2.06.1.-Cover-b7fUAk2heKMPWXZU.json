Helpless Defenders}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 195</em></p>\n<p>To determine whether your target has cover from your ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of the target&rsquo;s square passes through a square or border that blocks line of effect or provides cover, or through a square occupied by a creature, the target has cover (+4 to AC).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your target has cover if any line from any corner of your square to the target&rsquo;s square goes through a wall (including a low wall). When making a melee attack against a target that isn&rsquo;t adjacent to you (such as with a reach weapon), use the rules for determining cover from ranged attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Low Obstacles and Cover</h2>\n<p>A low obstacle (such as a wall no higher than half your height) provides cover, but only to creatures within 30 feet (6 squares) of it. The attacker can ignore the cover if he&rsquo;s closer to the obstacle than his target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cover and Attacks of Opportunity</h2>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cover and Reflex Saves</h2>\n<p>Cover grants you a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against attacks that originate or burst out from a point on the other side of the cover from you. Note that spread effects can extend around corners and thus negate this cover bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cover and Stealth Checks</h2>\n<p>You can use cover to make a Stealth check. Without cover, you usually need concealment (see below) to make a Stealth check.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-buffs.z87AmuqQYUWKsgBH]{Buff: Cover}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Soft Cover</h2>\n<p>Creatures, even your enemies, can provide you with cover against ranged attacks, giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, such soft cover provides no bonus on Reflex saves, nor does soft cover allow you to make a Stealth check.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-buffs.eD5e5MRoDhHo5W0U]{Buff: Cover (Soft)}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Big Creatures and Cover</h2>\n<p>Any creature with a space larger than 5 feet (1 square) determines cover against melee attacks slightly differently than smaller creatures do. Such a creature can choose any square that it occupies to determine if an opponent has cover against its melee attacks. Similarly, when making a melee attack against such a creature, you can pick any of the squares it occupies to determine if it has cover against you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Partial Cover</h2>\n<p>If a creature has cover, but more than half the creature is visible, its cover bonus is reduced to a +2 to AC and a +1 bonus on Reflex saving throws. This partial cover is subject to the GM&rsquo;s discretion.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-buffs.v8csFB59nyRmqq0D]{Buff:&nbsp;Cover (Partial)}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Total Cover</h2>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have line of effect to your target (that is, you cannot draw any line from your square to your target&rsquo;s square without crossing a solid barrier), he is considered to have total cover from you. You can&rsquo;t make an attack against a target that has total cover.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-buffs.LTLUW1y510Skco5R]{Buff:&nbsp;Cover (Total)}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Improved Cover</h2>\n<p>In some cases, such as attacking a target hiding behind an arrowslit, cover may provide a greater bonus to AC and Reflex saves. In such situations, the normal cover bonuses to AC and Reflex saves can be doubled (to +8 and +4, respectively). A creature with this improved cover effectively gains improved evasion against any attack to which the Reflex save bonus applies. Furthermore, improved cover provides a +10 bonus on Stealth checks.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-buffs.uzsXFLZ9vwB9urWd]{Buff:&nbsp;Cover (Improved)}</p>"
