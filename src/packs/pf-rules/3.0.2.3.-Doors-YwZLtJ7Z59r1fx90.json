Often they can be encounters all by themselves. Dungeon doors come in three basic types: wooden, stone, and iron.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wooden Doors</h2>\n<p>Constructed of thick planks nailed together, sometimes bound with iron for strength (and to reduce swelling from dungeon dampness), wooden doors are the most common type. Wooden doors come in varying strengths: simple, good, and strong. Simple doors (break DC 15) are not meant to keep out motivated attackers. Good doors (break DC 18), while sturdy and long-lasting, are still not meant to take much punishment. Strong doors (break DC 25) are bound in iron and are a sturdy barrier to those attempting to get past them. Iron hinges fasten the door to its frame, and typically a circular pull-ring in the center is there to help open it. Sometimes, instead of a pull- ring, a door has an iron pull-bar on one or both sides of the door to serve as a handle. In inhabited dungeons, these doors are usually well-maintained (not stuck) and unlocked, although important areas are locked up if possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stone</h2>\n<p>Carved from solid blocks of stone, these heavy, unwieldy doors are often built so that they pivot when opened, although dwarves and other skilled craftsfolk are able to fashion hinges strong enough to hold up a stone door. Secret doors concealed within a stone wall are usually stone doors. Otherwise, such doors stand as tough barriers protecting something important beyond. Thus, they are often locked or barred.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Iron</h2>\n<p>Rusted but sturdy, iron doors in a dungeon are hinged like wooden doors. These doors are the toughest form of nonmagical door. They are usually locked or barred.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Breaking Doors</h2>\n<p>Dungeon doors might be locked, trapped, reinforced, barred, magically sealed, or sometimes just stuck. All but the weakest characters can eventually knock down a door with a heavy tool such as a sledgehammer, and a number of spells and magic items give characters an easy way around a locked door. Attempts to literally chop down a door with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon use the hardness and hit points given in Table 13&ndash;2. When assigning a DC to an attempt to knock a door down, use the following as guidelines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DC 10 or Lower: a door just about anyone can break open.</p>\n<p>DC 11&ndash;15: a door that a strong person could break with one try and an average person might be able to break with one try.</p>\n<p>DC 16&ndash;20: a door that almost anyone could break, given time.</p>\n<p>DC 21&ndash;25: a door that only a strong or very strong person has a hope of breaking, probably not on the first try.</p>\n<p>DC 26 or Higher: a door that only an exceptionally strong person has a hope of breaking.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Locks</h2>\n<p>Dungeon doors are often locked, and thus the Disable Device skill comes in very handy. Locks are usually built into the door, either on the edge opposite the hinges or right in the middle of the door. Built-in locks either control an iron bar that juts out of the door and into the wall of its frame, or else a sliding iron bar or heavy wooden bar that rests behind the entire door. By contrast, padlocks are not built-in but usually run through two rings, one on the door and the other on the wall. More complex locks, such as combination locks and puzzle locks, are usually built into the door itself. Because such keyless locks are larger and more complex, they are typically only found in sturdy doors (strong wooden, stone, or iron doors).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Disable Device DC to pick a lock often falls within the range of 20 to 30, although locks with lower or higher DCs can exist. A door can have more than one lock, each of which must be unlocked separately. Locks are often trapped, usually with poison needles that extend out to prick a rogue&rsquo;s finger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Breaking a lock is sometimes quicker than breaking the whole door. If a PC wants to whack at a lock with a weapon, treat the typical lock as having hardness 15 and 30 hit points. A lock can only be broken if it can be attacked separately from the door, which means that a built-in lock is immune to this sort of treatment. In an occupied dungeon, every locked door should have a key somewhere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A special door might have a lock with no key, instead requiring that the right combination of nearby levers must be manipulated or the right symbols must be pressed on a keypad in the correct sequence to open the door.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stuck Doors</h2>\n<p>Dungeons are often damp, and sometimes doors get stuck, particularly wooden doors. Assume that about 10% of wooden doors and 5% of non-wooden doors are stuck. These numbers can be doubled (to 20% and 10%, respectively) for long-abandoned or neglected dungeons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Barred Doors</h2>\n<p>When characters try to bash down a barred door, it&rsquo;s the quality of the bar that matters, not the material the door is made of. It takes a DC 25 Strength check to break through a door with a wooden bar, and a DC 30 Strength check if the bar is made of iron. Characters can attack the door and destroy it instead, leaving the bar hanging in the now-open doorway.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Seals</h2>\n<p>Spells such as arcane lock can discourage passage through a door. A door with an arcane lock spell on it is considered locked even if it doesn&rsquo;t have a physical lock. It takes a knock spell, a dispel magic spell, or a successful Strength check to open such a door.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hinges</h2>\n<p>Most doors have hinges, but sliding doors do not. They usually have tracks or grooves instead, allowing them to slide easily to one side.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Standard Hinges</h2>\n<p>These hinges are metal, joining one edge of the door to the door frame or wall. Remember that the door swings open toward the side with the hinges. (So, if the hinges are on the PCs&rsquo; side, the door opens toward them; otherwise it opens away from them.) Adventurers can take the hinges apart one at a time with successful Disable Device checks (assuming the hinges are on their side of the door, of course). Such a task has a DC of 20 because most hinges are rusted or stuck. Breaking a hinge is difficult. Most have hardness 10 and 30 hit points. The break DC for a hinge is the same as for breaking down the door.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nested Hinges</h2>\n<p>These hinges are much more complex than ordinary hinges, and are found only in areas of excellent construction. These hinges are built into the wall and allow the door to swing open in either direction. PCs can&rsquo;t get at the hinges to fool with them unless they break through the door frame or wall. Nested hinges are typically found on stone doors but sometimes on wooden or iron doors as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pivots</h2>\n<p>Pivots aren&rsquo;t really hinges at all, but simple knobs jutting from the top and bottom of the door that fit into holes in the door frame, allowing the door to spin. The advantages of pivots are that they can&rsquo;t be dismantled like hinges and they&rsquo;re simple to make. The disadvantage is that since the door pivots on its center of gravity (typically in the middle), nothing larger than half the door&rsquo;s width can fit through without squeezing. Doors with pivots are usually stone and often quite wide to overcome this disadvantage. Another solution is to place the pivot toward one side and have the door be thicker at that end and thinner toward the other end so that it opens more like a normal door. Secret doors in walls often turn on pivots, since the lack of hinges makes it easier to hide the door&rsquo;s presence. Pivots also allow objects such as bookcases to be used as secret doors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Secret Doors</h2>\n<p>Disguised as a bare patch of wall (or floor or ceiling), a bookcase, a fireplace, or a fountain, a secret door leads to a secret passage or room. Someone examining the area finds a secret door, if one exists, on a successful Perception check (DC 20 for a typical secret door to DC 30 for a well-hidden secret door).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many secret doors require special methods of opening, such as hidden buttons or pressure plates. Secret doors can open like normal doors, or they might pivot, slide, sink, rise, or even lower like a drawbridge to permit access. Builders might put a secret door low near the floor or high in a wall, making it difficult to find or reach. Wizards and sorcerers have a spell, phase door, that allows them to create a magic secret door that only they can use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Doors</h2>\n<p>Enchanted by the original builders, a door might speak to explorers, warning them away. It might be protected from harm, increasing its hardness or giving it more hit points as well as an improved saving throw bonus against disintegrate and similar spells. A magic door might not lead into the space behind it, but instead might be a portal to a faraway place or even another plane of existence. Other magic doors might require passwords or special keys to open them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Portcullises</h2>\n<p>These special doors consist of iron or thick, ironbound wooden shafts that descend from recesses in the ceilings above archways. Sometimes a portcullis has crossbars that create a grid, sometimes not. Typically raised by means of a winch or a capstan, a portcullis can be dropped quickly, and the shafts end in spikes to discourage anyone from standing underneath (or from attempting to dive under it as it drops). Once it is dropped, a portcullis locks, unless it is so large that no normal person could lift it anyway. In any event, lifting a typical portcullis requires a DC 25 Strength check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 13-2: Doors</h2>\n<table style=\"height: 177px; width: 97.8261%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 81.0458%; height: 16px;\" colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.6928%; height: 16px;\" colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\">Break DC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Door Type</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Typical Thickness</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Hardness</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Hit Points</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Stuck</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Locked</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Simple wooden</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">1 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">10 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">13</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Good wooden</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">1-1/2 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">15 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">16</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 17px;\">Strong wooden</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 17px;\">2 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 17px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 17px;\">20 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 17px;\">23</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 17px;\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Stone</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">4 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">60 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">28</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">28</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Iron</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">2 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">60 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">28</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">28</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Portcullis, wooden</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">3 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">30 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">25*</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">25*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Portcullis, iron</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">2 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">60 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">25*</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">25*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Lock</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">15</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">30 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Hinge</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">30 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>*DC to lift.
