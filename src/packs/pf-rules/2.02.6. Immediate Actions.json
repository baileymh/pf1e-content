However, unlike a swift action, an immediate action can be performed at any time&mdash;even if it&rsquo;s not your turn. Casting feather fall is an immediate action, since the spell can be cast at any time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Using an immediate action on your turn is the same as using a swift action and counts as your swift action for that turn. You cannot use another immediate action or a swift action until after your next turn if you have used an immediate action when it is not currently your turn (effectively, using an immediate action before your turn is equivalent to using your swift action for the coming turn). You also cannot use an immediate action if you are flat-footed.</p>"
