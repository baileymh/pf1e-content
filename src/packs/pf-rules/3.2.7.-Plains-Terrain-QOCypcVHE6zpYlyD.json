Farms are common in settled areas, while grasslands represent untamed plains. The battlefields where large armies clash are temporary places, usually reclaimed by natural vegetation or the farmer&rsquo;s plow. Battlefields represent a third terrain category because adventurers tend to spend a lot of time there, not because they&rsquo;re particularly prevalent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The table below shows the proportions of terrain elements in the different categories of plains. On a farm, light undergrowth represents most mature grain crops, so farms growing vegetable crops will have less light undergrowth, as will all farms during the time between harvest and a few months after planting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The terrain elements in the table below are mutually exclusive.</p>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"width: 74.7969%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 98.7084%;\" colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\">Plains Category</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 41.5129%;\" scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.0331%;\" scope=\"col\">Farm</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 20.2842%;\" scope=\"col\">Grasslands</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 22.8782%;\" scope=\"col\">Battlefield</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 41.5129%;\">Light undergrowth</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.0331%;\">40%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 20.2842%;\">20%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 22.8782%;\">10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 41.5129%;\">Heavy undergrowth</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.0331%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 20.2842%;\">10%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 22.8782%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 41.5129%;\">Light rubble</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.0331%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 20.2842%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 22.8782%;\">10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 41.5129%;\">Trench</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.0331%;\">5%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 20.2842%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 22.8782%;\">5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 41.5129%;\">Berm</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.0331%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 20.2842%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 22.8782%;\">5%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<h2>Undergrowth</h2>\n<p>Whether they&rsquo;re crops or natural vegetation, the tall grasses of the plains function like light undergrowth in a forest. Particularly thick bushes form patches of heavy undergrowth that dot the landscape in grasslands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Light Rubble</h2>\n<p>On the battlefield, light rubble usually represents something that was destroyed: the ruins of a building or the scattered remnants of a stone wall, for example. It functions as described in the @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.3YyU7Yg6wbShgOKM]{3.2.6. Desert Terrain} section.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Trench</h2>\n<p>Often dug before a battle to protect soldiers, a trench functions as a low wall, except that it provides no cover against adjacent foes. It costs 2 squares of movement to leave a trench, but it costs nothing extra to enter one. Creatures outside a trench who make a melee attack against a creature inside the trench gain a +1 bonus on melee attacks because they have higher ground. In farm terrain, trenches are generally irrigation ditches.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Berm</h2>\n<p>A common defensive structure, a berm is a low, earthen wall that slows movement and provides a measure of cover. Put a berm on the map by drawing two adjacent rows of steep slope (described in @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.RVKULXygOAXTZ1WC]{3.2.4. Hills Terrain}), with the edges of the berm on the downhill side. Thus, a character crossing a 2-square berm will travel uphill for 1 square, then downhill for 1 square. Two square berms provide cover as low walls for anyone standing behind them. Larger berms provide the low wall benefit for anyone standing 1 square downhill from the top of the berm.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fences</h2>\n<p>Wooden fences are generally used to contain livestock or impede oncoming soldiers. It costs an extra square of movement to cross a wooden fence. A stone fence provides a measure of cover as well, functioning as low walls. Mounted characters can cross a fence without slowing their movement if they succeed on a DC 15 Ride check. If the check fails, the steed crosses the fence, but the rider falls out of the saddle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Other Plains Terrain Features</h2>\n<p>Occasional trees dot the landscape in many plains, although on battlefields they&rsquo;re often felled to provide raw material for siege engines (described in @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.a0xDSVGQRE2pVzkA]{3.3.2. Urban Features}). Hedgerows (described in Marsh Terrain) are found in plains as well. Streams, generally 5 to 20 feet wide and 5 to 10 feet deep, are commonplace.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stealth and Detection in Plains</h2>\n<p>In plains terrain, the maximum distance at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 6d6 &times; 40 feet, although the specifics of your map might restrict line of sight. Cover and concealment are not uncommon, so a good place of refuge is often nearby, if not right at hand.</p>"
