When a creature wielding a melee weapon made of mindglass succeeds at a saving throw against a psychic or mind-affecting effect from a creature, the weapon stores some of that energy and holds it for a future attack. A mindglass weapon can store this energy for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell, or half the creature&rsquo;s CR if the effect wasn&rsquo;t a spell or spell-like ability. If the weapon hits a creature while still holding this energy, it suffuses the target with a disruptive field for 1 round. On a critical hit, the disruptive field effect instead lasts for a number of rounds equal to the weapon&rsquo;s critical multiplier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While affected by this field, a target must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell&rsquo;s level) to cast any spell or spell-like ability (in addition to any other required concentration checks). If the check is failed, the affected creature&rsquo;s spell or spell-like ability is wasted. A Small or Medium weapon made of mindglass costs an additional 13,000 gp.</p>"
