In addition, whenever a character gains a level, she earns an additional hero point. Aside from these basic rules, awarding additional hero points is up to the GM. The following options are just some of the ways that a GM might award additional hero points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Character Story</h2>\n<p>GMs can award a hero point for the completion of a written character backstory. This reward encourages players to take an active role in the history of the game. In addition, the GM can use this backstory to generate a pivotal moment for your character concerning his past. When this key event is resolved, the GM can reward another hero point. Alternatively, the GM might award a hero point for painting a miniature or drawing a character portrait in the likeness of your character, helping the rest of the group visualize your hero.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Completing Plot Arcs</h2>\n<p>The GM might award a hero point to each of the PCs who were involved in completing a major chapter or arc in the campaign story. These hero points are awarded at the conclusion of the arc if the PCs were successful or advanced the story in a meaningful way.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Faith</h2>\n<p>In a campaign where the gods play an important role in every character&rsquo;s life, hero points might represent their favor. In such a setting, the GM can award hero points to characters whenever they uphold the tenets of their faith in a grand way, or whenever they take on one of the faith&rsquo;s major enemies. Such hero points might be temporary, and if not spent on the task at hand, they fade away.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Group Service</h2>\n<p>The GM can award hero points for acts outside the game as well. Buying pizza for the group, helping to clean up afterwards, or even hosting the game for a night might be worth a hero point. This sort of hero point should be given out of generosity, not as a payment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Heroic Acts</h2>\n<p>Whenever a character performs an exceptionally heroic act, she can be awarded a hero point. This might include anything from slaying an evil dragon when the rest of the group has f led to rescuing townsfolk from a burning building despite being terribly wounded. It does not have to be related to combat. Convincing the reticent king to send troops to help with a bandit problem or successfully jumping a wide chasm might earn a character a hero point, depending on the circumstances. Note that a hero point should only be awarded if the PC involved did not spend a hero point to accomplish the task.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Return from the Dead</h2>\n<p>When a character dies, she does not lose any hero points she has accumulated. If she died with no hero points remaining, she gains 1 hero point when she is brought back from the dead through powerful magic, such as raise dead or resurrection.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Maximum Hero Points</h2>\n<p>Characters can have no more than 3 hero points at any one time. Excess hero points are lost.</p>"
