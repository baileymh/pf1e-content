Designing Spells}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 131</em></p>\n<p>Most spells that directly affect creatures with a magical effect should allow a saving throw. Spells that create nonmagical materials that then strike or impede creatures (such as ice storm and sleet storm) do not normally require a saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spells that require the caster to make an attack roll to hit (even if it&rsquo;s a ranged touch attack) may or may not require a saving throw (enervation and searing light do not, disintegrate does). Attack effects that do not require rolling damage should always allow a saving throw to reduce or negate the effect; otherwise, the spell becomes an obvious choice for anyone of the level to cast it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tip: When deciding whether or not the spell should have a saving throw, consider how you&rsquo;d feel if someone used the spell on your favorite PC. If your PC didn&rsquo;t get any chance to resist the effect with a save or to dodge it entirely because of a failed attack roll, would you be annoyed, embarrassed, or angry? If so, you should give the spell some kind of save or attack roll, just so it&rsquo;s not an always-effective option.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fortitude Saves</h2>\n<p>Spells with Fortitude saves usually physically transform the target, apply an effect you&rsquo;d normally resist with a Fortitude save (such as disease or poison), or are a form of attack that sheer physical toughness is enough to resist. In general, making a successful Fortitude save means the effect hits, but the target toughs it out, like a bear shrugging off the stinky musk sprayed by a skunk. Note that if your spell only affects creatures&mdash;not objects&mdash;then nonliving creatures such as constructs and undead are immune to the spell. For example, this makes them immune to creature-oriented polymorphing spells, but not spells such as disintegrate, which can attack objects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Reflex Save</h2>\n<p>Spells with Reflex saves usually create a physical burst or spread in an area, like an explosion, which the target is able to dodge with a successful saving throw. In general, making a successful Reflex save means the target dodged the effect, or the effect rolled over or around the target with a lesser effect. Note that you shouldn&rsquo;t build a spell where the caster makes an attack roll and the target also makes a Reflex saving throw; doing so brings Dexterity into play twice for the same spell (once for the target&rsquo;s AC, once for the target&rsquo;s Reflex save modifier).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Will Saves</h2>\n<p>Spells with Will saves are mental, mind-affecting attacks; the target resists with pure mental power, by using evasive thoughts or noticing flaws in the spell&rsquo;s assault that can negate its effectiveness. A Will save is like a mental version of a Fortitude save; the effect &ldquo;hits&rdquo; the target, and whether or not it succeeds depends on the target&rsquo;s willpower. Most direct-attack Will-save spells (such as sleep and phantasmal killer) are mind-affecting effects (see Descriptors, below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some spells can be cast on objects, and the object only gets a saving throw if it is a magic item or is held by a creature; these spells should have &ldquo;(object)&rdquo; listed after the type of saving throw (see shrink item).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Helpful spells and spells that do not harm the target in any way either should have no saving throw, or should allow a saving throw but have &ldquo;(harmless)&rdquo; listed after the type of saving throw (see fly).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spells that only affect the caster never require a saving throw (you&rsquo;d never try to resist a beneficial spell you&rsquo;re casting on yourself ), so you don&rsquo;t list a saving throw for those spells at all (see true strike).</p>"
