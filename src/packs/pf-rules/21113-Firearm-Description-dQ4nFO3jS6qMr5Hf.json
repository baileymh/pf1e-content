Firearm Description}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 137</em></p>\n<p>There are two general categories of firearms: early and advanced.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Firearms are further divided into one-handed, twohanded, and siege firearms. As the category&rsquo;s name implies, one-handed firearms need only one hand to wield and shoot. Two-handed firearms work best when you use twohands while shooting them. Two-handed firearms can be shot with one hand at a &ndash;4 penalty on the attack roll. Siege weapons are typically mounted on some sort of platform, movable or otherwise, and have greater power but a much slower rate of fire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Scatter Weapon Quality</h2>\n<p>A weapon with the scatter weapon quality can shoot two different types of ammunition. It can fire normal bullets that target one creature, or it can make a scattering shot, attacking all creatures within a cone. Cannons with the scatter weapon quality only fire grapeshot, unless their descriptions state otherwise. When a scatter weapon attacks all creatures within a cone, it makes a separate attack roll against each creature within the cone. Each attack roll takes a &ndash;2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not foil a scatter attack. If any of the attack rolls threaten a critical, confirm the critical for that attack roll alone. A firearm that makes a scatter shot misfires only if all of the attack rolls made misfire. If a scatter weapon explodes on a misfire, it deals triple its damage to all creatures within the misfire radius.</p>"
