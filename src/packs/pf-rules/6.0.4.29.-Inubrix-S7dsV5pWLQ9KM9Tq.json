This quality earned the pale metal the nickname &ldquo;ghost iron.&rdquo; Inubrix is associated with necromancy magic, temperance, and gluttony. Inubrix is the softest of the solid skymetals, being only slightly less malleable than lead. It doesn&rsquo;t function well for crafting armor as a result, and though inubrix weapons can penetrate most metal armors with relative ease, the weapons tend to break easily. Inubrix has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An inubrix weapon deals damage as if it were one size category smaller than its actual size, and is always treated as if it had the broken condition. It ignores all armor or shield bonuses granted by iron or steel armor or shields. Inubrix weapons cannot damage these materials at all (and, by extension, cannot harm iron golems or similar creatures). An inubrix weapon costs +5,000 gp.</p>"
