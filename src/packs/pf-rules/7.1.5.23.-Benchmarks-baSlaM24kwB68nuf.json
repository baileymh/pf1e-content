Other spells are perfect examples of what a spell of that level or purpose should be able to do. These are &ldquo;benchmark&rdquo; spells, and when designing a new spell you should always compare your spell to the benchmark spells. If your spell is better than the benchmark spell, you should reduce its power or increase its spell level. The following is a list of benchmark spells by sorcerer/wizard spell level, with explanations of why they are benchmarks. If you create a spell and it&rsquo;s better than a comparable benchmark spell, your spell is too powerful.</p>"
