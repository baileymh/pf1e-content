Items not normally made of wood or only partially of wood (such as a battleaxe, mace, or other metal item with a wooden haft) either cannot be made from blackwood or do not gain any special benefit. The armor check penalty of a blackwood shield is reduced by 2 compared to an ordinary shield of its type.</p>\n<p>When wielded against creatures with the water subtype, mundane blackwood weapons ignore 1 point of the creature&rsquo;s DR (if any), and enchanted blackwood weapons ignore a number of DR equal to 2 times the weapon&rsquo;s enhancement bonus. To determine the price of a blackwood item, use the original weight but add 20 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item. Blackwood has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 7.</p>"
