A traveler in the Ethereal plane experiences the real world as if the world were an insubstantial ghost, and can move through solid objects without being seen in the real world. Strange creatures dwell in the Ethereal Plane, as well as ghosts and dreams, many of which can sometimes extend their influence into the real world in mysterious and terrifying ways. Powerful spellcasters utilize the Ethereal Plane with spells like blink, etherealness, and ethereal jaunt.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>GameMastery Guide pg. 191</em></p>\n<p>The Ethereal Plane is coexistent with the Material Plane and often other planes as well. The Material Plane itself is visible from the Ethereal Plane, but it appears muted and indistinct; colors blur into each other and edges are fuzzy.</p>\n<p>While it is possible to see into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane, the latter is usually invisible to those on the Material Plane. Normally, creatures on the Ethereal Plane cannot attack creatures on the Material Plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible, insubstanial, and utterly silent to someone on the Material Plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Planar Traits</h2>\n<p>The Ethereal Plane has the following traits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No Gravity</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Alterable Morphic</strong>: The plane contains little to alter, however.</li>\n<li><strong>Mildly Neutral-Aligned</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Normal Magic</strong>: Spells function normally on the Ethereal Plane, though they do not cross into the Material Plane. The only exceptions are spells and spell-like abilities that have the force descriptor and abjuration spells that affect ethereal beings; these can cross from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane. Spellcasters on the Material Plane must have some way to detect foes on the Ethereal Plane before targeting them with force-based spells. While it&rsquo;s possible to hit ethereal enemies with a force spell cast on the Material Plane, the reverse isn&rsquo;t possible. No magical attacks cross from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane, including force attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Occult Adventures pg. 240</em></p>\n<p>The Ethereal Plane is the seat of emotional forces, the mist-shrouded home of haunts and horrors, and the ever-present doorway between the worlds of the Inner Sphere. The Ethereal Plane coexists with these planes, interpenetrating them and generally mimicking their contours and vistas, albeit with greatly reduced visibility thanks to drifting fog and the slow rise and fall of fading sheets of light like the somber interior of a thunderstorm. From within the Ethereal Plane, these neighboring worlds appear hazy and indistinct, as if viewed through frosted glass. Inhabitants of neighboring planes can&rsquo;t perceive the Ethereal Plane at all, though certain mortals blessed or cursed with psychic sensitivity sometimes catch glimpses of its vistas. Since the Ethereal Plane is generally invisible from the other planes of the Inner Sphere, creatures under the effects of spells like ethereal jaunt and etherealness cannot be seen by creatures who are not themselves ethereal. Normally, creatures on the Ethereal Plane cannot attack creatures on the Material Plane, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Within the mists of the Ethereal Plane, warped, indistinct versions of locations overlap their Inner Sphere counterparts. This, coupled with the inherent weightlessness of creatures in the plane, makes it tempting to use the Ethereal Plane as a vantage to scout out unknown locales by passing through incorporeal walls and floating over traps with ease. The natural denizens of the plane make this a frightful prospect, however, and ensure that most forays into the Ethereal Plane are brief endeavors. Among the deadliest of local hazards are the blood-red xill&mdash;warlike, plane-shifting outsiders who incubate their eggs in living mortals. Worse still, hideous, cackling night hags use the Ethereal Plane as a byway to the Dimension of Dreams, where they slip into nightmares to abduct mortal souls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The twisted remnants of mortal souls comprise the vast majority of the Ethereal Plane&rsquo;s inhabitants. Some souls, freed from their physical bodies by death, remain tethered to the Ethereal Plane by profound emotional distress and cannot proceed along multiversal currents to join the River of Souls flowing inexorably toward the Boneyard until they sever the powerful emotional ties that bind them. Indeed, the longer these souls remain stalled on their afterlife journey, the closer they slide toward the Negative Energy Plane, and the more of their memories and personalities become subsumed by raw emotional distress and psychic damage. These souls eventually manifest as incorporeal undead, frequently in the form of wraiths and spectres.</p>\n<p>Spiritualists call out to the spirits of the Ethereal Plane and open their physical minds as refuges for them to inhabit. With practice and the help of a trained spiritualist, a spirit can even take its own physical form on the neighboring planes by cloaking itself in a sheath of ectoplasm, the ghostly substance that acts as a veil between worlds. These spirit guides are known as phantoms, and while they are loyal to the spiritualist to whom they are bound, the emotional connection to the Ethereal Plane remains strong, manifesting in jealousy and fiery outbursts from even the kindest of souls. The ectoplasmic nature of the Ethereal Plane is extraordinarily susceptible to the thoughts and emotions of the plane&rsquo;s inhabitants. The ethereal version of a physical location is informed not just by its actual dimensions and appearance, but also by the memories and impressions of the spirits that haunt it.</p>\n<p>For example, on the Ethereal Plane, an old mansion might look as it did in the era of its ghostly inhabitants. If those spirits find final rest, their memories cannot sustain the structure, and it falls into an ethereal ruin. Some incorporeal spirits become so entwined with the emotional nature of the plane that they can manifest these ectoplasmic vistas in an overlapping location on a neighboring plane, temporarily cloaking it in a disturbing reflection of some past incarnation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a similar way that locations in the outside world possess overlapping etheric reflections, mortal creatures also have ethereal doppelgangers in the form of etheric doubles that exactly overlie their physical forms. The etheric double is a vessel for the cosmic breath of life that gives a creature animate force, most commonly known as ki. This energy collects in seven blazing vortices of colorful energy known as chakras, which bind the etheric double and the physical body together and distribute vital life energy to both. This energy extends 2 to 3 feet beyond the outlines of the creature&rsquo;s physical form to create its aura, a nimbus of colorful occult energies that reveals much about a creature&rsquo;s disposition and emotional state.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A creature&rsquo;s etheric double, aura, and chakras are not visible except to those with the knowledge or magic to see them. From the Material Plane, this involves esoteric use of the Perception skill by a creature with the Psychic Sensitivity feat or any of a number of spells. From within the Ethereal Plane, all it takes to observe the interplay of these forces is simple concentration&mdash; if you know what to look for, it becomes plainly visible. Interpreting this information, of course, is another matter. An etheric double is outlined in violet-gray or blue-gray luminescence. Unlike an astral body generated by astral projection or a lucid body of the Dimension of Dreams, an etheric double is not normally capable of acting as a separate vehicle of consciousness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, the sweeping expanse of the Ethereal Plane is home to countless pocket realities known as demiplanes. Many of these unique realms are the private domains of powerful arcane spellcasters, the playgrounds of minor gods, the experiments of the inscrutable elohim, or the prisons of creatures that pose such danger to the cosmos that they must never be released.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Denizens</h2>\n<p>Despite its barren emptiness, the Ethereal Plane is far from uninhabited. The most notorious of its denizens are the xills, blood-red planar marauders with the power to step into the Material Plane and abduct creatures to serve as living hosts for their eggs. These alien outsiders have a tyrannical military culture and see all other creatures as fodder for their expansion&mdash;particularly phase spiders, a race that the xills have warred against for eons. Vile sahkils move through the Ethereal Plane as well, seeping out from the nightmare realm to torment the mortal world, and while they are most at home in that demiplane, they are disturbingly common foes across the Ethereal Plane as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These are far from the only creatures lurking in the mists, however. Aether elementals twist and dance in places where the Elemental Planes brush close to the Ethereal Plane, mighty etheric dragons lurk in secluded holdings, and phase spiders spin their twisted web settlements when not battling against their xill enemies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfettered phantoms wander the mists, desperately seeking escape from the ravenous entropy of the Negative Energy Plane, while the enigmatic caulborn sift memories and secrets from mortal emotions. Animate dreams that have escaped from the countless dreamscapes floating through the Ethereal Plane, along with more dangerous nightmare creatures, wander the mists serving their own strange intentions. And though they are more commonly associated with the evil-aligned planes, night hags stalk the Ethereal Plane (often riding atop their nightmare steeds) in search of dreaming mortals to prey upon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Xevnorvex</h3>\n<p>The eerie creatures known as caulborn have long wandered the planes searching for psychic energies and new lore to add to their collective minds. As the Ethereal Plane is rich in both, it is no surprise that the caulborn first emerged into reality. Today, the caulborn primarily dwell on the Material Plane, but their Ethereal fortress, Xevnorvex, is every bit as strange and off-putting as its creators&mdash;a vast, grublike life-form that bears obvious kinship to the caulborn, wriggling its way through the misty void. Its insides are a mix of raw brain tissue used for memory accumulation and organic chambers suitable for caulborn habitation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Divinities</h2>\n<p>Few deities are known to make their homes in the mists of the Ethereal Plane, for there is little of substance to claim, and the lack of large quantities of quintessence limits options for expanding divine realms. Sahkil tormentors dwell in one of the largest demiplanes drifting within the Ethereal Plane. The only real exception is a patron of night hags who has long dwelled on the Ethereal Plane to be closer to the dreams of mortals and gods alike. Many night hags believe that her continued presence is one of the things that gives them power over dreaming mortals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Movement on the Ethereal Plane</h2>\n<p>The Ethereal Plane&rsquo;s lack of gravity and near-total absence of solid matter would normally make movement close to impossible; however, as a result of its psychic resonance, creatures can move themselves through the plane via a sustained force of will. This requires the same action as regular movement, but the creature only moves at half its normal base speed (or one-quarter its normal speed if it lacks an Intelligence score). A creature with a swim or burrow speed can use that speed to determine its halved movement rate instead.</p>\n<p>Creatures capable of flight or whose movement is based on non-terrestrial means such as ectoplasmic gliding can move at their full speed. Movement in this fashion is a purely mental action, and a creature that is paralyzed can still move normally in this manner. Any effect that prevents thought components from functioning also prevents movement in this way on the Ethereal Plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vision in the Ethereal Plane</h2>\n<p>The ever-present mist and fog on the Ethereal Plane give the realm an eerie, gray-green glow such that true darkness is rare, but the mist also distorts and obscures line of sight beyond 300 feet. From this distance to a distance of 900 feet, creatures and objects are visible as blurry, indistinct shapes in the mist and gain concealment. Beyond 900 feet, vision is obscured completely, although certain immense objects may be visible as lighter or darker shapes in the mist at great distance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abilities that allow for sight through mist or fog grant the ability to see normally, yet this does nothing to change the fact that there is rarely anything of import to see in this mostly empty realm.</p>"
