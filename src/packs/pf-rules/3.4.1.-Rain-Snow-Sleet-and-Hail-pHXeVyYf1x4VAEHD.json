Torrential downpours and blizzards obscure vision as effectively as a dense fog.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most precipitation is rain, but in cold conditions it can manifest as snow, sleet, or hail. Precipitation of any kind followed by a cold snap in which the temperature dips from above freezing to 30&deg; F or below might produce ice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Rain</h2>\n<p>Rain reduces visibility ranges by half, resulting in a &ndash;4 penalty on Perception checks. It has the same effect on flames, ranged weapon attacks, and Perception checks as severe wind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Snow</h2>\n<p>Falling snow has the same effects on visibility, ranged weapon attacks, and skill checks as rain, and it costs 2 squares of movement to enter a snow-covered square. A day of snowfall leaves 1d6 inches of snow on the ground.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Heavy Snow</h2>\n<p>Heavy snow has the same effects as normal snowfall but also restricts visibility as fog does (see @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.zbaKzSfM3Synw9Cd]{3.4.3. Fog}). A day of heavy snow leaves 1d4 feet of snow on the ground, and it costs 4 squares of movement to enter a square covered with heavy snow. Heavy snow accompanied by strong or severe winds might result in snowdrifts 1d4 &times; 5 feet deep, especially in and around objects big enough to deflect the wind&mdash;a cabin or a large tent, for instance. There is a 10% chance that a heavy snowfall is accompanied by lightning (see @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.CGWYylbSPcCdf6xq]{3.4.2. Storms}). Snow has the same effect on flames as moderate wind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sleet</h2>\n<p>Essentially frozen rain, sleet has the same effect as rain while falling (except that its chance to extinguish protected flames is 75%) and the same effect as snow once on the ground.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hail</h2>\n<p>Hail does not reduce visibility, but the sound of falling hail makes sound-based Perception checks more difficult (&ndash;4 penalty). Sometimes (5% chance) hail can become large enough to deal 1 point of lethal damage (per storm) to anything in the open. Once on the ground, hail has the same effect on movement as snow.</p>"
