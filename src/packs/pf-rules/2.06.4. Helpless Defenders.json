Helpless Defenders}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 197</em></p>\n<p>A helpless opponent is someone who is bound, sleeping, paralyzed, unconscious, or otherwise at your mercy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Regular Attack</h2>\n<p>A helpless character takes a &ndash;4 penalty to AC against melee attacks. In addition, a helpless character is treated as having a Dexterity of 0, giving him a &ndash;5 penalty to AC against both melee and ranged attacks (for a total of &ndash;9 against melee and &ndash;5 against ranged).</p>\n<p>A helpless character is also flat-footed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Coup de Grace</h2>\n<p>As a full-round action, you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace (pronounced &ldquo;coo day grahs&rdquo;) to a helpless opponent. You can also use a bow or crossbow, provided you are adjacent to the target.</p>\n<p>You automatically hit and score a critical hit. If the defender survives the damage, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. A rogue also gets her extra sneak attack damage against a helpless opponent when delivering a coup de grace.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents.</p>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t deliver a coup de grace against a creature that is immune to critical hits. You can deliver a coup de grace against a creature with total concealment, but doing this requires two consecutive full-round actions (one to &ldquo;find&rdquo; the creature once you&rsquo;ve determined what square it&rsquo;s in, and one to deliver the coup de grace).</p>"
