Mounts that do not possess combat training (see the Handle Animal skill) are frightened by combat. If you don&rsquo;t dismount, you must make a DC 20 Ride check each round as a move action to control such a mount. If you succeed, you can perform a standard action after the move action. If you fail, the move action becomes a full-round action, and you can&rsquo;t do anything else until your next turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your mount acts on your initiative count as you direct it. You move at its speed, but the mount uses its action to move. A horse (not a pony) is a Large creature and thus takes up a space 10 feet (2 squares) across. For simplicity, assume that you share your mount&rsquo;s space during combat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Combat while Mounted</h2>\n<p>With a DC 5 Ride check, you can guide your mount with your knees so as to use both hands to attack or defend yourself. This is a free action.</p>\n<p>When you attack a creature smaller than your mount that is on foot, you get the +1 bonus on melee attacks for being on higher ground. If your mount moves more than 5 feet, you can only make a single melee attack. Essentially, you have to wait until the mount gets to your enemy before attacking, so you can&rsquo;t make a full attack. Even at your mount&rsquo;s full speed, you don&rsquo;t take any penalty on melee attacks while mounted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your mount charges, you also take the AC penalty associated with a charge. If you make an attack at the end of the charge, you receive the bonus gained from the charge. When charging on horseback, you deal double damage with a lance (see Charge).</p>\n<p>You can use ranged weapons while your mount is taking a double move, but at a &ndash;4 penalty on the attack roll. You can use ranged weapons while your mount is running (quadruple speed) at a &ndash;8 penalty. In either case, you make the attack roll when your mount has completed half its movement. You can make a full attack with a ranged weapon while your mount is moving. Likewise, you can take move actions normally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Casting Spells While Mounted</h2>\n<p>You can cast a spell normally if your mount moves up to a normal move (its speed) either before or after you cast. If you have your mount move both before and after you cast a spell, then you&rsquo;re casting the spell while the mount is moving, and you have to make a concentration check due to the vigorous motion (DC 10 + spell level) or lose the spell. If the mount is running (quadruple speed), you can cast a spell when your mount has moved up to twice its speed, but your concentration check is more difficult due to the violent motion (DC 15 + spell level).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>If Your Mount Falls in Battle</h2>\n<p>If your mount falls, you have to succeed on a DC 15 Ride check to make a soft fall and take no damage. If the check fails, you take 1d6 points of damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>If You Are Dropped</h2>\n<p>If you are knocked unconscious, you have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle (75% if you&rsquo;re in a military saddle). Otherwise you fall and take 1d6 points of damage. Without you to guide it, your mount avoids combat.</p>"
