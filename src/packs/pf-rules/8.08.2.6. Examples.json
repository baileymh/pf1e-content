Magic Item Creation}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 165</em></p>\n<p>To help explain these rules, the following section includes a number of sample wordspells that could be created using the words of power system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Burst Fire Blast (magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3)</h2>\n<p>This simple wordspell does 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to anything caught in a 10-footradius burst. If the wordcaster boosts the target word, this wordspell more closely resembles fireball, dealing damage in a 20-foot-radius burst. The targets receive a Ref lex saving throw to halve the damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Selected Ice Blast Life Leech (magus 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6)</h2>\n<p>This wordspell causes the target to take 10d6 points of cold damage and 1d4 temporary negative levels, and to become entangled for 1d4 rounds. The target receives either a Fortitude save or a Ref lex save, chosen by the caster. If the save is successful, the target takes half the cold damage, takes no negative levels, and is not entangled. A sorcerer, witch, or wizard can boost the target word to make this spell affect multiple targets, but doing so increases the spell&rsquo;s overall level to 9th.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Selected Alignment Shield Enhance Form Grave Bane (cleric 6)</h2>\n<p>This wordspell grants the target a number of bonuses. First, it grants the target a +2 bonus to AC and on saving throws when it is attacked by creatures of one alignment type (chosen by the wordcaster). The wordspell also grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (chosen by the wordcaster).</p>\n<p>Finally, the wordspell grants an additional +4 sacred bonus on saving throws made against death spells and death magic effects; the subject cannot gain negative levels while this wordspell is in effect, and the target is automatically stabilized if brought below 0 hit points. All of these effects last for 1 round per level, as that is the duration of the effect word with the shortest duration. Note that alignment shield is only 1st level, and could be replaced with a 2nd-level effect word without changing the overall level of the spell.</p>"
