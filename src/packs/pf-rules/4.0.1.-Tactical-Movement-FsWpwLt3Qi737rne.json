Characters generally don&rsquo;t walk during combat, for obvious reasons&mdash; they hustle or run instead. A character who moves his speed and takes some action is hustling for about half the round and doing something else the other half.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hampered Movement</h2>\n<p>Difficult terrain, obstacles, and poor visibility can hamper movement (see Table 7&ndash;7 for details). When movement is hampered, each square moved into usually counts as two squares, effectively reducing the distance that a character can cover in a move. If more than one hampering condition applies, multiply all additional costs that apply. This is a specific exception to the normal rule for doubling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In some situations, your movement may be so hampered that you don&rsquo;t have sufficient speed even to move 5 feet (1 square). In such a case, you may use a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. Even though this looks like a 5-foot step, it&rsquo;s not, and thus it provokes attacks of opportunity normally. (You can&rsquo;t take advantage of this rule to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited to you.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t run or charge through any square that would hamper your movement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 7-7: Hampered Movement</h2>\n<table style=\"height: 80px; width: 45.4415%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.5116%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Condition</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.8244%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Additional Movement Cost</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.5116%; height: 16px;\">Difficult Terrain</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.8244%; height: 16px;\">&times;2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.5116%; height: 16px;\">Obstacle*</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.8244%; height: 16px;\">&times;2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.5116%; height: 16px;\">Poor Visibility</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.8244%; height: 16px;\">&times;2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.5116%; height: 16px;\">Impassable</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.8244%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>* May require a skill check</p>"
