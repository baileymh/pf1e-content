Sometimes a few combatants on each side are aware and the other combatants on each side are unaware.</p>\n<p>Determining awareness may call for Perception checks or other checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Surprise Round</h2>\n<p>If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise round happens before regular rounds begin. In initiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take a standard or move action during the surprise round. You can also take free actions during the surprise round. If no one or everyone is surprised, no surprise round occurs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Unaware Combatants</h2>\n<p>Combatants who are unaware at the start of battle don&rsquo;t get to act in the surprise round. Unaware combatants are flat-footed because they have not acted yet, so they lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>"
