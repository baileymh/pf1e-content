Saving Throws}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 180</em></p>\n<p>Sometimes a combatant in a melee lets her guard down or takes a reckless action. In this case, combatants near her can take advantage of her lapse in defense to attack her for free. These free attacks are called attacks of opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Threatened Squares</h2>\n<p>You threaten all squares into which you can make a melee attack, even when it is not your turn. Generally, that means everything in all squares adjacent to your space (including diagonally). An enemy that takes certain actions while in a threatened square provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you&rsquo;re unarmed, you don&rsquo;t normally threaten any squares and thus can&rsquo;t make attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Reach Weapons</h2>\n<p>Most creatures of Medium or smaller size have a reach of only 5 feet. This means that they can make melee attacks only against creatures up to 5 feet (1 square) away. However, Small and Medium creatures wielding reach weapons threaten more squares than a typical creature. In addition, most creatures larger than Medium have a natural reach of 10 feet or more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Provoking an Attack of Opportunity</h2>\n<p>Two kinds of actions can provoke attacks of opportunity: moving out of a threatened square and performing certain actions within a threatened square.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Moving</h2>\n<p>Moving out of a threatened square usually provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents. There are two common methods of avoiding such an attack&mdash;the 5-foot step and the withdraw action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Performing a Distracting Act</h2>\n<p>Some actions, when performed in a threatened square, provoke attacks of opportunity as you divert your attention from the battle. @Compendium[pf-content.gm-quick-reference.SWqKXW5UFTffIcpI]{Combat Actions (AoO)} notes many of the actions that provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>Remember that even actions that normally provoke attacks of opportunity may have exceptions to this rule.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Making an Attack of Opportunity</h2>\n<p>An attack of opportunity is a single melee attack, and most characters can only make one per round. You don&rsquo;t have to make an attack of opportunity if you don&rsquo;t want to. You make your attack of opportunity at your normal attack bonus, even if you&rsquo;ve already attacked in the round.</p>\n<p>An attack of opportunity &ldquo;interrupts&rdquo; the normal flow of actions in the round. If an attack of opportunity is provoked, immediately resolve the attack of opportunity, then continue with the next character&rsquo;s turn (or complete the current turn, if the attack of opportunity was provoked in the midst of a character&rsquo;s turn).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Combat Reflexes and Additional Attacks of Opportunity</h2>\n<p>If you have the Combat Reflexes feat, you can add your Dexterity bonus to the number of attacks of opportunity you can make in a round. This feat does not let you make more than one attack for a given opportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two attacks of opportunity from you, you could make two separate attacks of opportunity (since each one represents a different opportunity). Moving out of more than one square threatened by the same opponent in the same round doesn&rsquo;t count as more than one opportunity for that opponent. All these attacks are at your full normal attack bonus.</p>"
