This makes the metal relatively useless for crafting metal objects (although many gifted metallurgists, such as Xin himself, have had some success creating djezet alloys), but most who seek out this metal intend to use it instead as an additional material component for spellcasting, since it possesses an ability to enhance magic.</p>\n<p>Djezet is associated with enchantment magic, love, and lust. Used as an additional material component, a dose of djezet increases the effective level of a spell by +1, as if it were being modified by the Heighten Spell feat. In order to function as an additional material component, the spellcaster must use a number of doses of djezet equal to the spell&rsquo;s level&mdash;additional djezet used beyond this amount does nothing. Djezet costs 200 gp per dose.</p>"
