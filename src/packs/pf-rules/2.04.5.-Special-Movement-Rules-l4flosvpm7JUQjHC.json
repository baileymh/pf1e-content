Special Movement Rules}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 194</em></p>\n<p>These rules cover special movement situations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Accidentally Ending Movement in an Illegal Space</h2>\n<p>Sometimes a character ends its movement while moving through a space where it&rsquo;s not allowed to stop. When that happens, put your miniature in the last legal position you occupied, or the closest legal position, if there&rsquo;s a legal position that&rsquo;s closer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Double Movement Cost</h2>\n<p>When your movement is hampered in some way, your movement usually costs double. For example, each square of movement through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, and each diagonal move through such terrain counts as 3 squares ( just as two diagonal moves normally do).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If movement cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as 4 squares (or as 6 squares if moving diagonally). If movement cost is doubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if diagonal) and so on. This is an exception to the general rule that two doublings are equivalent to a tripling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Minimum Movement</h2>\n<p>Despite whatever penalties to movement you might have, you can take a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. This rule doesn&rsquo;t allow you to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited. Such movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal (despite the distance covered, this move isn&rsquo;t a 5-foot step).</p>"
