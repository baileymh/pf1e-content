Designing Spells}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 128</em></p>\n<p>The intended function is the most important consideration when designing a spell. Specifically, function refers to the tangible game effects of the spell, such as dealing damage, applying a condition such as sickened, or giving a bonus on saves or attack rolls. Everything else is cosmetic at this point&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s slashing damage or fire damage, makes a target sickened or confused, grants an insight bonus on saves or an enhancement bonus on attack rolls, or looks like unicorns or fire demons. Some sample functions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deal damage to one opponent</li>\n<li>Deal damage to multiple opponents</li>\n<li>Apply a condition or effect to one opponent</li>\n<li>Apply a condition or effect to multiple opponents</li>\n<li>Give a defensive bonus to one ally</li>\n<li>Give a defensive bonus to multiple allies</li>\n<li>Give an offensive bonus to one ally</li>\n<li>Give an offensive bonus to multiple allies</li>\n<li>Heal one ally</li>\n<li>Heal multiple allies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A spell can do several of these things at once, or give the caster a choice between several options, but such spells should always be less powerful than a single-purpose spell of the same spell level, so keep that in mind when designing the spell. Note that &ldquo;condition or effect&rdquo; is the broadest category in the above list, which includes actual conditions like sickened and panicked, as well as effects like teleportation.</p>"
