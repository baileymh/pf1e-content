Adding to these abilities requires the expenditure of Construction Points (CP), as described in the Animated Object monster entry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Augmented Critical (Ex, 1 CP)</h2>\n<p>Increase the threat range for the animated object&rsquo;s melee attacks by 1 or the threat multiplier by 1. This cannot combine with itself or with the piercing attack or slashing attack object abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Exceptional Reach (Ex, 1 CP)</h2>\n<p>The object gains +5 feet of reach with one melee attack. Increase reach on all attacks for an additional +1 CP.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Improved Attack (Ex, 1 CP)</h2>\n<p>All the animated object&rsquo;s melee or ranged attacks do damage as though it were one size category larger. A crafter must purchase Improved Attack separately for melee and ranged attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Piercing Attack (Ex, 1 CP)</h2>\n<p>Replace one melee attack with an attack that does the same amount of piercing damage and has a &times;3 multiplier. Replace all melee attacks for an additional +1 CP. Object abilities that specify slam attacks do not work on piercing attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ranged Attack (Ex, 2 CP)</h2>\n<p>Replace one slam attack with a ranged attack. It does the same amount of damage, and has a range of 20 feet. Replace all attacks for an additional +2 CP. Object abilities that specify slam attacks do not work on ranged attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Slashing Attack (Ex, 1 CP)</h2>\n<p>Replace one slam attack with an attack that does slashing damage and has either a 19&ndash;20 threat range (for blade-like attacks) or a &times;3 threat multiplier (for axe- or scythelike attacks). Replace all melee attacks for an additional +1 CP. Object abilities that specify slam attacks do not work on slashing attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Trip (Ex, 2 CP)</h2>\n<p>The object gains the trip special ability with one of its slam attacks.</p>"
