Scholars suspect that these features have grown in the stones of the bridge over the ages since Earthfall, and were not originally intended or even anticipated by the structure&rsquo;s architects. Bridge stones harvested from underwater rubble or mined from offshore pilings are not only of great value to builders and sculptors, but also of particular interest to those seeking to create stone constructs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Physical Properties</h2>\n<p>Irespan basalt is as hard as iron, while retaining its other stony features for carving and building. It has hardness 10 and typically fetches a price of about 5 sp per pound. However, since few buyers are interested in stones of less than 1,000 pounds, the Irespan basalt trade is relatively limited to specialists capable of harvesting and transporting such heavy blocks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Building Constructs</h2>\n<p>When a construct&rsquo;s materials consist entirely of Irespan stone, its Craft DC increases by +5, but the required Caster Level decreases by 1. In addition, stone constructs crafted from Irespan stone gain a +2 bonus to Strength and gain twice as many bonus hit points as normal from the construct type.</p>"
