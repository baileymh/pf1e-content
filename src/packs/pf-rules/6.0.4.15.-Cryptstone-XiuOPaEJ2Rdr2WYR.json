While cryptstone may appear ancient and pitted, the supernatural essence of the Boneyard has infused it with power over the eons. A weapon made of cryptstone grants a +1 bonus on weapon damage rolls against undead creatures; this damage is multiplied on a critical hit. Additionally, any nonmagical weapon made of cryptstone affects incorporeal undead as if it were a magic weapon, and weapons made of cryptstone that have the disruption special ability increase the DC of that ability by +1.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cryptstone can be used to craft bludgeoning melee weapons and ammunition that deals bludgeoning damage. Weapons made of cryptstone are always considered masterwork, and the masterwork costs are included in the listed prices. Items not primarily made from stone are not meaningfully affected by being partially made from cryptstone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cryptstone has the same hit points and hardness as steel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 57.7843%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 54.8246%;\" scope=\"col\">Type of Cryptstone Item</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.4444%;\" scope=\"col\">Item Price Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 54.8246%;\">Ammunition</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.4444%;\">+10 gp per item</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 54.8246%;\">Weapon</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.4444%;\">+500 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
