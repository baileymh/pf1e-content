This easily worked metal can be used in place of steel for both weapons and armor. For simplicity&rsquo;s sake, similar or component metals such as brass, copper, or even tin can use the following rules, even though in reality bronze is both harder and more reliable than those metals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Light and one-handed weapons can be crafted from bronze. Likewise, spear points, arrowheads, and axe heads can be crafted from bronze, even those that are parts of twohanded weapons. Bronze is too weak to be used for twohanded weapons made entirely out of metal, and cannot typically be used to craft polearms, with the exception of the rhomphaia (see page 35).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bronze weapons have the hardness of their base weapons but also have the fragile quality. Bronze weapons deal the same damage as steel weapons of the same type, and have the same cost and weight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bronze can be used to create any medium or light armor that are made entirely of metal or that have metal components. Bronze armor protects a creature as well as steel armor does, but it has the fragile quality. Bronze armor has the same cost and weight as normal steel armor of its type. Bronze armor has hardness 9. Magically strengthened bronze does not have the fragile quality and can be made into heavy armor.</p>"
