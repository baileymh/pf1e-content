Surprise}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 178</em></p>\n<p>At the start of a battle, each combatant makes an initiative check. An initiative check is a Dexterity check. Each character applies his or her Dexterity modifier to the roll, as well as other modifiers from feats, spells, and other effects. Characters act in order, counting down from the highest result to the lowest. In every round that follows, the characters act in the same order (unless a character takes an action that results in his or her initiative changing; see @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.K9b3WAUD63Up5YM2]{2.08. Special Initiative Actions}).</p>\n<p>If two or more combatants have the same initiative check result, the combatants who are tied act in order of total initiative modifier (highest first). If there is still a tie, the tied characters should roll to determine which one of them goes before the other.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Flat-Footed</h2>\n<p>At the start of a battle, before you have had a chance to act (specifically, before your first regular turn in the initiative order), you are flat-footed. You can&rsquo;t use your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) while flat-footed. Barbarians and rogues of high enough level have the uncanny dodge extraordinary ability, which means that they cannot be caught flat-footed. Characters with uncanny dodge retain their Dexterity bonus to their AC and can make attacks of opportunity before they have acted in the first round of combat. A flat-footed character can&rsquo;t make attacks of opportunity, unless he has the @Compendium[pf-content.pf-feats.Rc5rGOpYGM2jHKjS]{Combat Reflexes} feat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Inaction</h2>\n<p>Even if you can&rsquo;t take actions, you retain your initiative score for the duration of the encounter.</p>"
