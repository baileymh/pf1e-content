A creature standing in the same square as a tree gains partial cover, which grants a +2 bonus to Armor Class and a +1 bonus on Reflex saves. The presence of a tree doesn&rsquo;t otherwise affect a creature&rsquo;s fighting space, because it&rsquo;s assumed that the creature is using the tree to its advantage when it can. The trunk of a typical tree has AC 4, hardness 5, and 150 hp. A DC 15 Climb check is sufficient to climb a tree. Medium and dense forests have massive trees as well. These trees take up an entire square and provide cover to anyone behind them. They have AC 3, hardness 5, and 600 hp. Like their smaller counterparts, it takes a DC 15 Climb check to climb them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Undergrowth</h2>\n<p>Vines, roots, and short bushes cover much of the ground in a forest. A space covered with light undergrowth costs 2 squares of movement to move into, and provides concealment. Undergrowth increases the DC of Acrobatics and Stealth checks by 2 because the leaves and branches get in the way. Heavy undergrowth costs 4 squares of movement to move into and provides concealment with a 30% miss chance (instead of the usual 20%). It increases the DC of Acrobatics checks by 5. Heavy undergrowth is easy to hide in, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. Running and charging are impossible. Squares with undergrowth are often clustered together. Undergrowth and trees aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive; it&rsquo;s common for a 5-foot square to have both a tree and undergrowth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Forest Canopy</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s common for elves and other forest dwellers to live on raised platforms far above the surface floor. These wooden platforms often have rope bridges between them. To get to the treehouses, characters ascend the trees&rsquo; branches (Climb DC 15), use rope ladders (Climb DC 0), or take pulley elevators (which can be made to rise a number of feet equal to a Strength check, made each round as a full-round action). Creatures on platforms or branches in a forest canopy are considered to have cover when fighting creatures on the ground, and in medium or dense forests they have concealment as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Other Forest Terrain Elements</h2>\n<p>Fallen logs generally stand about 3 feet high and provide cover just as low walls do. They cost 5 feet of movement to cross. Forest streams average 5 to 10 feet wide and no more than 5 feet deep. Pathways wind through most forests, allowing normal movement and providing neither cover nor concealment. These paths are less common in dense forests, but even unexplored forests have occasional game trails.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stealth and Detection in a Forest</h2>\n<p>In a sparse forest, the maximum distance at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 3d6 &times; 10 feet. In a medium forest, this distance is 2d8 &times; 10 feet, and in a dense forest it is 2d6 &times; 10 feet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because any square with undergrowth provides concealment, it&rsquo;s usually easy for a creature to use the Stealth skill in the forest. Logs and massive trees provide cover, which also makes hiding possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The background noise in the forest makes Perception checks that rely on sound more difficult, increasing the DC of the check by 2 per 10 feet, not 1.</p>"
