Normally, charged items have 50 charges at most (10 for staves). If such an item is found as a random part of a treasure, roll d% and divide by 2 to determine the number of charges left (round down, minimum 1). If the item has a maximum number of charges other than 50, roll randomly to determine how many charges are left.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Prices listed are always for fully charged items. (When an item is created, it is fully charged.) For an item that&rsquo;s worthless when its charges run out (which is the case for almost all charged items), the value of the partially used item is proportional to the number of charges left. For an item that has usefulness in addition to its charges, only part of the item&rsquo;s value is based on the number of charges left.</p>"
