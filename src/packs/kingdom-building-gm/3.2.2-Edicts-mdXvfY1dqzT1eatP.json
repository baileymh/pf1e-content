  "content": "<p>Edicts are the official pronouncements by your government about how you are running the kingdom that turn. For example, you may decide to have low or high taxes, to have more or fewer holidays, and how much effort to put into improving the kingdom's infrastructure. Edicts fall into four types: Holiday, Improvement, Promotion, and Taxation.</p>\n<p>In the Edict phase of the kingdom turn, you may set the Holiday, Promotion, and Taxation edict categories to whatever level you want, as well as decide how much of your allowed improvement from the Improvement edict you'll use. For example, you may decide that this turn holidays are quarterly, promotions are aggressive, taxation is minimal, and you won't build any improvements.</p>\n<h1>Improvement Edicts</h1>\n<p>Improvements are physical improvements you can make to your kingdom: founding new settlements, adding buildings to a settlement, building roads, creating facilities such as mines to tap natural resources, and claiming more hexes for your kingdom. Your kingdom's Size limits how many improvements you can make each turn; see Table: Improvement Edicts. You can make all of the improvements listed on the appropriate row of the table. For example, if your kingdom's Size is 5, on each turn you can create 1 new settlement, 1 new building, 2 terrain improvements, and claim 1 more hex.</p>\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>Improvement Edicts are detailed in greater depth in Steps 2, 3 and 4 of the Edict Phase.</p>\n<h1>Holiday Edicts</h1>\n<p>Holidays are general celebrations or observances that take place across the kingdom. The BP expenditure includes lost revenue from citizens not working during the holidays, preparations and logistical arrangements that occur year round, and the cost of the actual celebrations (these annual costs are averaged over the year and included in the listed Consumption modifier that you pay each turn).</p>\n<p>The number of holidays per year is the number you promise to uphold and the number that the common folk expect to enjoy over the next months. The Loyalty and Consumption modifiers change as soon as you change the number of holidays per year. The listed number assumes that you are fulfilling your promise - if you announce 12 holidays in the coming year but don't actually hold and pay for them, the GM should increase your kingdom's Unrest to reflect public disappointment and outrage.</p>\n<p><strong>Example: </strong>Logan is the Ruler of a kingdom with some Loyalty issues. He issues a Holiday edict that there will be 24 kingdom-wide official holidays in the next year (Loyalty +4, Consumption +8). In the second turn, he worries about the increased Consumption's effect on the Treasury, so he issues a new Holiday edict decreeing that until further notice, there will be no kingdom-wide holidays. He loses the previous +4 Loyalty bonus and incurs a -1 Loyalty penalty for the new Holiday edict, but no longer has to pay the 8 Consumption each turn for his previous edict. If he frequently changes Holiday edicts from high to low levels, the GM may decide that his citizens no longer believe such promises and he won't gain any benefits from having a high level of Holiday edict until he becomes consistent.</p>\n<h1>Promotion Edicts</h1>\n<p>Promotion edicts are events and actions the kingdom uses to attract new citizens and increase the well-being of the kingdom, such as recruitment campaigns, advertisements about services and goods, and propaganda to improve the perception of your kingdom at home and abroad. Promotions increase Consumption, but also increase Stability.</p>\n<h1>Taxation Edicts</h1>\n<p>Setting the tax level determines how much revenue you collect from taxes in the Income phase. Higher taxes increase your kingdom's Economy (making it easier for you to succeed at Economy checks to generate revenue) but make your citizens unhappy (reducing Loyalty).</p>\n<h1>Table: Holiday Edicts</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Per Year</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Loyalty</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Consumption</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>-1</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Table: Promotion Edicts</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Promotion Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Stability</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Consumption</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>-1</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Token</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Standard</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aggressive</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expansionist</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Table: Taxation Edicts</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tax Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Economy</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Loyalty</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>None</td>\n<td>+0</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Light</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Normal</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Heavy</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>-4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Overwhelming</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"
