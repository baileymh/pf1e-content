A Shrine increases one attribute, and only by 1; for example, a lawful good Shrine increases Economy by 1 or Loyalty by 1.<br /><br />Instead of granting alignment-based bonuses, a religious building may grant bonuses based on the portfolio of its chosen god. For example, a Temple of the goddess of wine may increase Economy and Loyalty (the same attributes as a Tavern) each by 2, and a Temple of the god of greed may increase Economy and Stability (the same attributes as a Black Market) each by 2. These values replace the building&rsquo;s normal modifiers to Economy, Loyalty, and Stability, and should never provide bonuses greater than the building&rsquo;s normal bonuses (+1 for a Shrine, +4 for a Temple, +8 for a Cathedral).</span></p>",
