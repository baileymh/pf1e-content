If your kingdom controls 0 hexes, skip the Upkeep phase and proceed to the Edict phase.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.kingdom-building-gm.FSnZzkLWx7JXVTNH]{Phase 2 - Edict} Declare official proclamations about taxes, diplomacy, and other kingdom-wide decisions.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.kingdom-building-gm.fGcu61Aqr7vZZr0E]{Phase 3 - Income} Add to your Treasury by collecting taxes and converting gp into BP, or withdraw BP from your kingdom for your personal use.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.kingdom-building-gm.UcG7OO0sjsXtqoPD]{Phase 4 - Event} Check whether any unusual events occur that require attention. Some are beneficial, such as an economic boom, good weather, or the discovery of remarkable treasure. Others are detrimental, such as foul weather, a plague, or a rampaging monster.</p>\n<p>These phases are always undertaken in the above order. Many steps allow you to perform an action once per kingdom turn; this means once for the entire kingdom, not once per leader.</p>"
