  "content": "<p>In the Event phase, a random event may affect your kingdom as a whole or a single settlement or hex.</p>\n<p>There is a 25% chance of an event occurring. If no event occurred during the last turn, this chance increases to 75%.</p>\n<p>Some events can be negated, ended, or compensated for with some kind of kingdom check. Others, such as a rampaging monster, require you to complete an adventure or deal with a problem in a way not covered by the kingdom-building rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Example: </strong>The GM rolls on one of the event tables and determines that a monster is attacking one of the kingdom's hexes. Instead of attempting a Stability check to deal with the monster (risking increasing Unrest if it fails), Jessica and the other leaders go on a quest to deal with the monster personally. They defeat the monster, so the event does not generate any Unrest. At the end of this phase, the kingdom's scores are unchanged: Economy 55, Loyalty 42, Stability 55, Unrest 4, Consumption 4, and Treasury 27 BP.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.kingdom-building-gm.0ldugHkgrlRY8tDu]{Kingdom Events}</p>"
