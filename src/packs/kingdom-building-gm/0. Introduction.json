  "content": "<p>Some heroes found kingdoms, driving out hostile&nbsp; monsters to make room for peaceful settlers. Others lead&nbsp; soldiers into battle, waging great and terrible wars. This&nbsp; chapter presents rules for building a kingdom and waging&nbsp; war that focus on the larger tactics of city planning and&nbsp; troop strategy rather than managing details of individual&nbsp; settlers and soldiers.</p>\n<p>This manuel uses &ldquo;kingdom&rdquo; as a universal term to&nbsp; represent all kinds of domains, regardless of size, form of&nbsp; government, and gender of the ruler. Most of the decisions&nbsp; are in the hands of the players, and these rules are written&nbsp; with that assumption, using terms like &ldquo;your kingdom&rdquo;&nbsp; and &ldquo;your army.&rdquo; However, the GM is still in charge of the&nbsp; campaign, and is expected to make judgments about the&nbsp; repercussions of player decisions. While players running&nbsp; a kingdom should be allowed to read these rules (having&nbsp; them do so makes much of the kingdom building easier&nbsp; for the GM), the players shouldn&rsquo;t think they can abuse&nbsp; these rules to exploit weird corner cases. For example,&nbsp; players may decide to construct a city full of graveyards&nbsp; because of the bonuses they provide to the city, but if the GM believes that is unreasonable, he could decide that&nbsp; the city is prone to frequent undead attacks. Likewise,&nbsp; a settlement with more magic shops than houses and&nbsp; businesses may slowly become a ghost town as all the&nbsp; normal citizens move elsewhere out of superstitious fear.&nbsp; As with a normal campaign, the GM is the final arbiter&nbsp; of the rules, and can make adjustments to events as&nbsp; necessary for the campaign.</p>\n<h1>Kingdom Building</h1>\n<p>Ruling a kingdom is a complex and difficult task, one undertaken only by the very ambitious. Many PCs are content to live as mercenaries or treasure hunters, no interest in being responsible for the health and well-being of subjects; for these characters, a kingdom is simply a place they pass through on the way to the next adventure. However, characters who are keen to spread their wings and forge a place of power and inf luence in the world can use this chapter to create a different sort of campaign. If the PCs are interested in ruling only a single town or castle and the small region around it, kingdom building can focus primarily on the settlement and the PCs&rsquo; personal demesne. If the PCs have larger goals, such as carving out a new, independent kingdom, these rules allow them to build cities and engage in trade, diplomacy, and war.</p>\n<p>These rules assume that all of the kingdom&rsquo;s leaders are focused on making the kingdom prosperous and stable, rather than oppressing the citizens and stealing from the treasury. Likewise, the rules assume that the leaders are working together, not competing with each other or working at odds. If the campaign begins to step into those areas, the GM is free to introduce new rules to deal with these activities.</p>\n<p>Like the exploration system, the kingdombuilding rules measure terrain in hexes. Each hex is 12 miles from corner to corner, representing an area of just less than 95 square miles. The hex measurement is an abstraction; the hexes are easy to quantify and allow the GM to categorize a large area as one terrain type without having to worry about precise borders of forests and other terrain features.</p>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>The key parts of the kingdom-building rules that you&rsquo;ll be referencing are as follows:</p>\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span> Explanation of the kingdom terminology used throughout this chapter.</p>\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span> Step-by-step instructions for founding a kingdom.</p>\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span> The turn sequence for an established kingdom.</p>\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span> The game statistics for terrain improvements.</p>\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span> Step-by-step instructions on how to found your first settlement.</p>\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span> The game statistics for the types of buildings.</p>\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span> The settlement District Grid.</p>\n<p>&bull;<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span> The kingdom sheet.</p>\n<p>Following the main rules and the types of buildings are several optional rules for kingdom building, such as modifying the effect of religious buildings based on alignment or deity portfolio, tracking Fame and Infamy scores for your kingdom, rules for different types of government, and special edicts you can declare during the turn sequence.</p>"
