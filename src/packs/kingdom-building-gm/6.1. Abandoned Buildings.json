If this occurs, you lose the building&rsquo;s benefit and Unrest increases by 1.<br /><br />If you build a replacement for the abandoned building, on the next Upkeep phase you may attempt an Economy check to activate the abandoned building; success means the abandoned building is occupied and provides its bonuses. If you fail, you may keep trying on the next turn.</span></p>",
