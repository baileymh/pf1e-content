The oil is used to reduce the sound armor and weapons make while moving. Applying this oil to a single piece of equipment takes 1 minute and grants the wearer a +2 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks for 30 minutes. A vial of this oil is enough to coat one Medium piece of equipment, while a Large piece of equipment requires 4 vials. Two pieces of Small equipment can be covered with a single vial of oil. Exposure to or submersion in large amounts of water, such as swimming, immediately ends the effect of the oil.</p>",
