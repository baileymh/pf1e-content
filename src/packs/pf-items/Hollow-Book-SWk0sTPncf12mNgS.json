However, it is designed to hold a concealed item within its pages. One type of hollow book simply has a cavity cut into the interior pages that can hold a small pouch or similar item. Flipping the cover of this type of book open instantly reveals its true nature. Another type has a much thinner cavity cut into its unusually thick cover. The cavity is concealed by the book's end-paper, which is affixed to the inside of the cover by a gentle adhesive and can be peeled back and then reclosed repeatedly. A small packet of folded documents can be carefully hidden inside the cavity, and a successful DC 20 Perception check is required to notice the hidden space.</p>",
