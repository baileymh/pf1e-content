Travelers in the Dragon Empires leave these offerings at the small shrines or holy sites that can be found scattered along roads. For 1 hour after a traveler leaves a spirit offering, any kami (<em>Bestiary 3</em> 159) the traveler encounters has its initial attitude improved by one step. This attitude adjustment reverts to normal after 10 minutes unless the creature's attitude is adjusted further during that time, such as via the Diplomacy skill, in which case the kami's attitude does not revert after the offering's effect expires. Once a spirit offering has been used to improved a kami's attitude, it cannot be reused.</p>",
