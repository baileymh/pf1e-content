This requires seven separate successful DC 14 Craft (alchemy) checks, one every 24 hours during this week. If even one of those checks is a failure, the dose of merfolk's comb is ruined.<br/><strong>Use</strong> Anyone who eats a dose of merfolk's comb gains the ability to breathe water as well as air for 8 hours.</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbolN.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"The herbalism subsystem is not legal for play; instead a PC with at least one rank in Craft (alchemy) and 1 rank in either Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) can purchase the herbs in this book at a 10% discount that does not stack with other discounts; if a PC's ranks in these skills are 5 or higher, the discount increases to 15%, and if a PC's ranks in these skills are 10 or higher, the discount increases to 20%\"/>Description</h2><p>This vibrant yellow and pale-green variety of seaweed has wide fronds with lines of narrow fringe along the upper edge.</p>",
