This grants the creature a new saving throw to immediately end a single mind-affecting effect currently affecting the creature (effects that allow no saving throw cannot be removed in this way). An unwilling creature can be dosed with the pollen as a touch attack that provokes an attack of opportunity. A creature can be affected by a dose of nepenthe only once in a single 24-hour period. This is a poison effect.</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbolN.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"The herbalism subsystem is not legal for play; instead a PC with at least one rank in Craft (alchemy) and 1 rank in either Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) can purchase the herbs in this book at a 10% discount that does not stack with other discounts; if a PC's ranks in these skills are 5 or higher, the discount increases to 15%, and if a PC's ranks in these skills are 10 or higher, the discount increases to 20%\"/>Description</h2><p>This foot-tall blue-green pitcher plant produces a pollen that smells faintly of mint and lures insects and even small vertebrates toward its dangerous mouth.</p>",
