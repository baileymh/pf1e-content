      "value": "<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Adventurer's Armory pg. 19</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 20 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Black Market</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>Description</h2><p>The milk of this vibrantly green cactus, when mixed with resins and other ingredients, congeals into sticky, black chunks with an exceedingly sour taste. Though pesh comes in several different varieties, refined pesh is both the most potent and expensive type. Taking refined pesh gives a person 15 temporary hit points for 1 hour, a +2 morale bonus on saves versus fear effects for 1 day, and a -4 penalty to Dexterity and Wisdom for 1 day. Pesh is addictive (Fortitude DC 10 to resist), and long-term users suffer Dexterity and Wisdom damage. </p><h2 class=\"framing\">False Pesh</h2><p> <em>Dark Markets - A Guide to Katapesh pg. 14</em><br/> False pesh looks much the same as real pesh, but the genuine plant is a spined cactus that grows in desert areas, while the imposter is a sticky, more bulbous plant that requires extra moisture to flourish. A character can make a DC 15 Knowledge (nature) check to tell the real plant from the fake.<br/><br/> Imitation raw pesh formed from the false pesh plant is much harder to differentiate from the real drug. Both appear as milky white, cheese-like blocks; the false pesh has a milder odor and a stickier gloss to its surface, but the differences are minor. A DC 25 Alchemy check discerns true raw pesh from false.<br/><br/> Anyone ingesting false raw pesh must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 10 minutes. After 1 minute they must make another DC 25 Fortitude save or suffer the secondary effect of 1d4 points of Constitution damage. For refined false pesh, the save DC is 30 and the secondary effect is 1d6 points of Constitution damage. The Alchemy check to distinguish it from true refined pesh is DC 30.</p>",
