      "value": "<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Blood of the Elements pg. 21</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 200 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 2 lbs.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Tools</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>Description</h2><p>This vibrant, variegated gemstone is found naturally on the Elemental Plane of Earth but can also be artificially reproduced, albeit with a fair amount of difficulty. The catalyst is highly sought for its remarkable ability to enhance and alter alchemical tools and weapons.<br/><br/> As a move action, you can apply the catalyst to one of the following items to enhance or alter the alchemical item's effects (items marked with an asterisk ['*'] are detailed in <em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment</em>). If the item is not used within 3 rounds, the benefit of the enhanced alchemical item is lost and the item reverts to normal. Once applied to an item, a planar alchemical catalyst is expended.<br/><br/> <em>Alchemist's Fire</em>: The type of energy damage changes to acid, cold, or electricity (user's choice).<br/><br/> <em>Flash Powder</em>*: The DC of the Fortitude save increases to 15, and targets are dazzled for 1d4+1 rounds whether or not they succeed at their saving throw.<br/><br/> <em>Holy Water</em>: The splash area becomes difficult terrain for undead and evil outsiders, and undead or evil outsiders that end their turn in the affected area take 2 points of damage. Both of these effects last 3 rounds.<br/><br/> <em>Impact Foam</em>*: The foam does not dissolve when exposed to acid or water, and instead becomes a pliable-yet-rigid platform that can be dragged onto water and used as a makeshift raft for up to 5 Medium creatures. The 10-minute duration still applies.<br/><br/> <em>Liquid Blade</em>*: The blade deals 2 points of bleed damage on a hit (this does not stack with bleed damage from other sources).<br/><br/> <em>Liquid Ice</em>*: In addition to its normal effects, the liquid ice acts as a smokestick, except it emits dense white fog rather than smoke.<br/><br/> <em>Shard Gel</em>*: The shard gel remains embedded in the target on a direct hit, continuing to deal 1d3 points of damage each round after until the gel dissolves (5 rounds) or the target takes a full round action to remove it.<br/><br/> <em>Tanglefoot Bag</em>: The DC of the Reflex saving throw increases to 17, the penalty on attack rolls is -3, and the tanglefoot bag can affect targets up to size category Huge.<br/><br/> <em>Thunderstone</em>: In addition to being deafened, targets that fail their Fortitude saves are staggered for 1 round. Affected targets are deafened for 1d4 rounds whether or not they succeed at their saving throw.</p>",
