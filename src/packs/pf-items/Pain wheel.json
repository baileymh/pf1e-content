When you whirl this cruel weapon above your head as a standard action, it scatters salt in a 5-foot radius centered on your space. Creatures in the affected area (including you) that have fewer than their maximum number of hit points must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be sickened by pain for 1d6 rounds. Creatures affected by bleed effects take a -5 penalty on their saves. A successful DC 11 Heal check ends the sickened condition, as does the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. A pain wheel must be loaded with a pound of salt (a move action) before it can be used. You can also load a dose of itching powder (<em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment </em>108) or another alchemical powder normally used as a splash weapons into a pain wheel; when a pain wheel is used this way, the affected area (including your square) is treated as the splash radius for the purpose of determining the powder's effects, and there is no way to deal a direct hit with the powder.</p>",
