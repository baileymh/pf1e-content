When you hold the mouthpiece in your mouth, the tube extends past your face and toward the back of your head, allowing you to breathe indefinitely when swimming facedown or barely submerged. If you submerge the tip of the snorkel, it floods with water and can't be used to breathe until you clear the water from it (requiring a move action and full access to air). A typical snorkel's length is about 15 inches; any shorter than this and it tends to fill with water when you swim, but any longer and you're not moving enough fresh air through the snorkel to be effective.<br/><br/> <em>Masterwork Snorkel</em>: This snorkel has a valve at the top to keep out of the water, keeping it from being flooded from splashes or when you submerge. It also has a sump and valve near your mouth, preventing water from reaching your mouth and automatically draining excess water when you surface.</p>",
