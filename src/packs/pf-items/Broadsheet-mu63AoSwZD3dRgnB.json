Most cities in technologically developed nations with printing presses have multiple wealthy or government-backed publishers that put out broadsheets. A broadsheet typically provides information as if the reader had attempted a Diplomacy check to gather information about the topic of the broadsheet (usually news of current politics, scandals, or business) and the result of the check were 10. Rather than 1d4 hours, gathering information in this way takes only as long as is required to read the broadsheet. Broadsheets printed with engraved-plate printing presses are at least a few weeks out of date, but those printed with movable-type presses can contain news from as recently as yesterday.</p>",
