(fuel)</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2><p>This steel sphere is about the size of a standard cannon ball, though it's significantly lighter. Small holes pock the surface of the sphere, which can be unscrewed into two hemispherical pieces. By filling the intricate hollows in an opened powder ball with a specific mixture of volatile chemical reagents (which can typically be purchased in Highhelm for around 200 gp) and inserting a proprietary fuse, an individual can use the weapon as a time-delayed explosive device, throwing it as a splash weapon or simply placing it where she wants it to explode. The fuse can be ignited as a move action; 1d4 rounds afterward, the powder ball explodes, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to anything in a 10-foot-radius burst (DC 15 for half ). A powder ball explodes in this way three times- the second explosion occurs 1d3 rounds after the initial explosion, and the third explosion occurs 1d2 rounds after the second. After the third explosion, the empty powder ball can be refilled and used again.</p>",
