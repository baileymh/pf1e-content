At the end of this preparation time, the yellow spots' color changes to bright orange or dark brown-there's a 50% chance of either development.<br/><strong>Use</strong> When eaten without proper preparation, a fairy cap is mildly poisonous (<em>save</em> Fort DC 13, <em>onset</em> 1 minute, <em>frequency</em> 1/minute for 6 minutes, <em>effect</em> nauseated for 1 minute, <em>cure</em> 1 save), but when properly prepared, it takes on a notunpleasant tangy flavor. The final color of a properly prepared fairy cap's spots determines its effect when consumed. A cap with orange spots causes a Large or smaller creature to grow one size category, while one with brown spots causes the eater to shrink one size category. These effects function as per <em>enlarge person</em> or <em>reduce person</em>, except they can affect any Large or smaller living creature; the effects persist for 10 minutes in either case. Whether or not it is prepared, a fairy cap is quite chewy, and eating it is a full-round action.</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbolN.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"The herbalism subsystem is not legal for play; instead a PC with at least one rank in Craft (alchemy) and 1 rank in either Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) can purchase the herbs in this book at a 10% discount that does not stack with other discounts; if a PC's ranks in these skills are 5 or higher, the discount increases to 15%, and if a PC's ranks in these skills are 10 or higher, the discount increases to 20%\"/>Description</h2><p>This toadstool's pale-gray cap is stippled with yellow spots.
