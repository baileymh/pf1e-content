(treated hemp), 5 lbs. (woven kelp)</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2><p>Rope used by surface dwellers breaks down when submerged for long periods, so undersea dwellers make use of rope designed to withstand their environment. Treated hemp rope is usually created by surfacers in the same manner as hemp rope, but it is infused with beeswax or linseed oil to preserve its integrity underwater. This rope is therefore only commonly used by underwater races that trade with land dwellers on a regular basis. Woven kelp rope is crafted from specially grown seaweed by undersea communities and is much more common in insular or deepwater communities.<br/><br/> Both types of marine rope are sold in 50-foot lengths. Treated hemp has 2 hit points and can be broken with a DC 23 Strength check. Woven kelp has 3 hit points and can be broken with a DC 24 Strength check.</p>",
