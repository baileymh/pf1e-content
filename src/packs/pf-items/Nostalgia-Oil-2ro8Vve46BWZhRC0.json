Nostalgia oil is a vial of concentrated aromatics that evoke positive memories of the Grand Lodge and common trials overcome during a Pathfinder's training. By dabbing this oil on her face, neck, or arms as a standard action, a Pathfinder gains a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws against effects with the emotion<sup>UM</sup> descriptor and on secondary saving throws made to resist <em>dominate person</em> and similar compulsion effects that would force her to harm her allies or betray her mission. Applied in this way, a vial of nostalgia oil remains potent for 8 hours or until washed off with soap and water. Nostalgia oil can also be thrown as a splash weapon, extending its benefits for 1 hour to any Pathfinder struck with a direct hit. Alternatively, a creature can mix it with a pint of lantern oil or piece of incense, which grants half the nostalgia oil's benefits to all Pathfinders within 20 feet of the lantern or censor for 1 hour; any strong wind (21+ mph) dissipates the aroma for 1 minute.<br/><br/> Crafting a vial of nostalgia oil requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check. Although most nostalgia oil is mixed to benefit only Pathfinder agents, other mixtures might be created to benefit only members of another clan, neighborhood, or organization.</p>",
