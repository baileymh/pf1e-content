This equipment package is well-suited to a cleric, inquisitor<sup>APG</sup>, paladin, warpriest<sup>ACG</sup>, or even a fighter with a religious background. It's especially suited to characters who focus on supporting their party members and making them more effective in a fight. Even more than with other equipment packages, the GM should consider substituting the masterwork longsword in this package with a masterwork melee weapon appropriate to the PC's faith. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch. <br/><b>Armor</b>: Heavy steel shield, masterwork breastplate. <br/><b>Weapons</b>: Cold iron morningstar, heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork longsword. <br/><b>Combat Gear</b>: Alchemist's fire (3), holy water (4), <i>oil of bless weapon</i>, <i>potions of cure light wounds</i> (2), <i>potion of protection from evil</i>, sunrods (3). <br/><b>Other Gear</b>: Backpack, bedroll, belt pouch, candles (5), chalk (5 pieces), crowbar, flint and steel, holy symbol (silver), mess kit<sup>UE</sup>, sack, silk rope (50 ft.), trail rations (5 days), waterskin, 7 gp. <br/><b>Total Weight</b>: 102 lbs.
