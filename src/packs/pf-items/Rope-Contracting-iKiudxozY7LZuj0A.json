When any part of the rope is touched to an open flame, it suddenly contracts to one-fifth its original length, pulling any creature or object attached to one side to within 10 feet of the other; if multiple creatures are moved into the same square, they fall prone in randomly determined adjacent squares. Because of the sudden jerk, a creature holding a contracting rope must succeed at a DC 10 Climb check to avoid dropping it as it contracts (unless it is knotted around the creature's waist, clamped in a locked gauntlet, or otherwise firmly attached to the creature). The rope fails to contract if it would pull more than 1,000 pounds horizontally or lift more than 250 pounds vertically. Once activated, the rope slowly unravels to its normal length over the course of 24 hours and can't be activated again until such time has passed.</p>",
