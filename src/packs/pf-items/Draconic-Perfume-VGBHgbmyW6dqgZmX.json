Dragon musk is secreted in dragons' oil glands, and harvesting it is a very delicate procedure. Though only mildly fragrant, dragon musk can elicit a variety of effects when added to perfume. The effect depends largely on the other ingredients in the perfume, but a single application of draconic perfume lasts only 1 hour, regardless of its specific properties. Some of the more common additives are listed below.<br/><br/> <em>Rosewood and myrrh</em>: This concoction is an aphrodisiac, and any creature wearing this perfume gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks and increases the DCs of any charm subschool spells cast during this time by 2.<br/><br/> <em>Sage, bergamot, and cedar ash</em>: This pungent aroma has an imposing effect. Any creature wearing this perfume gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks and does not take any penalties for attempting to Intimidate a larger opponent.<br/><br/> <em>Sulfur and honeycomb</em>: This aroma is sometimes called 'Hell's Smell.' Any creature wearing this scent gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks and increases the DC of any compulsion subschool spells cast during this time by 2.<br/><br/> Each vial of draconic perfume contains 1 application of the scent. Producing draconic perfume requires 1 vial of musk, the Dragoncrafting feat, and a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.</p>",
