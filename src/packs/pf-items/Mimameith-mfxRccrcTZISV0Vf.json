When a mimameith tree is burned but lives, its bark regrows over time with pale gray scarring-such bark bears special properties. Once harvested, this bark can be processed alchemically. Doing so requires a 5-pound dose of the bark to be soaked in water for 8 hours and then boiled off to a thin layer of tacky paste with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.<br/><strong>Use</strong> When a dose of the pasty residue from mimameith bark is applied to a creature's skin as a standard action, the subject gains damage reduction 2/bludgeoning, fire resistance 5, and immunity to bleed effects for 1 hour.</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbolN.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"The herbalism subsystem is not legal for play; instead a PC with at least one rank in Craft (alchemy) and 1 rank in either Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) can purchase the herbs in this book at a 10% discount that does not stack with other discounts; if a PC's ranks in these skills are 5 or higher, the discount increases to 15%, and if a PC's ranks in these skills are 10 or higher, the discount increases to 20%\"/>Description</h2><p>The bark of this wide-trunked but relatively squat tree is resistant to cutting and fire.</p>",
