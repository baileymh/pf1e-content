Those who don't use a tossglove when attempting to sling such creatures provoke an attack of opportunity from the animal they attempt to throw or stash. The glove has overlapping plates that cover the goblin's arm up to the elbow. It's a full-round action to put on or take off a tossglove, and while it's worn, that hand can't be used to perform acts of fine manipulation (such as making a Disable Device check or firing an arrow). The gloved hand can still wield a melee weapon.</p>",
