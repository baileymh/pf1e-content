Processing a dose of the pigment takes 4 hours and requires a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check. Angelstep pigment costs twice as much as the raw fungus.<br/><strong>Use</strong> As part of an attempt to stabilize a dying creature, a dose of raw angelstep can be rubbed on the creature to grant a +4 bonus on the Heal check to stabilize the creature. A dose of angelstep pigment applied to the skin of a Medium or smaller creature helps to protect that creature against death for 2d4 hours. The next time the wearer of angelstep pigment drops to negative hit points, it gains a +4 alchemical bonus on its next 1d6 Constitution checks to stabilize. The pigment loses its effect once all these checks are attempted or once the victim is stabilized.</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbolN.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"The herbalism subsystem is not legal for play; instead a PC with at least one rank in Craft (alchemy) and 1 rank in either Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) can purchase the herbs in this book at a 10% discount that does not stack with other discounts; if a PC's ranks in these skills are 5 or higher, the discount increases to 15%, and if a PC's ranks in these skills are 10 or higher, the discount increases to 20%\"/>Description</h2><p>This iridescent white shelf fungus is said to have first grown from the footsteps of an angel, though some claim it instead comes from the footsteps of a djinni.</p>",
