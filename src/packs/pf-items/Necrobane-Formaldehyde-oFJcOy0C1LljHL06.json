When introduced into a dead body, necrobane formaldehyde slows the process of decay, keeping the corpse from stinking and rotting for 1d6 days after death. Treating a body with necrobane formaldehyde takes 1 hour and requires a successful DC 25 Heal check. A corpse injected with necrobane formaldehyde is more difficult to resurrect as an undead creature for 1d6 days after injection. Anyone attempting to seed unlife in a corpse treated in this substance must succeed at a DC 14 caster level check to complete the process or the spell fails and its components are wasted. This is also the case for creatures that ingest necrobane formaldehyde and subsequently die before the effect's duration has expired.<br/><br/> If an undead creature ingests necrobane formaldehyde (perhaps by eating part of an embalmed corpse), the undead creature becomes fatigued for 2d6 rounds.<br/><br/> When ingested by a living creature, necrobane formaldehyde nauseates the imbiber for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save reduces the nauseated effect to sickened and halves the Constitution damage (minimum 1). This is a poison effect, though the pungent aroma and unmistakably toxic taste of necrobane formaldehyde makes it difficult to use as a surreptitious weapon.<br/><br/> Crafting necrobane formaldehyde requires a successful DC 23 Craft (alchemy) check.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 23</p>",
