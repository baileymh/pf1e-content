Inside, festering chunks of monkey meat are covered in fungal mycelium and seeded with fly eggs, though the mixture's potency is not evident until it's exposed to air. Once the jar is opened (a standard action), the stench quickly becomes overpowering as the jar's contents swell and rot at an accelerated rate. Any living creature within 15 feet of the jar when it is opened must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds.<br/><br/> Vermin and undead have a hard time distinguishing carrion bait from rotten human flesh, but intelligent undead that succeed at a DC 15 Perception check realize the difference. Regardless, any creature that spends more than 1 round eating the carrion bait quickly realizes its error, since the bait continues to swell and grow even as it's digested. One round after eating carrion bait, an affected undead or vermin becomes staggered for 1d4 rounds as its belly bulges to incredible proportions (other creature types cannot stomach carrion bait and instead are nauseated for 2d4 rounds). If the affected creature is already staggered, its movement speed instead decreases by 10 feet for the duration of the carrion bait's effect. Crafting carrion bait requires a successful DC 19 Craft (alchemy) check.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 19</p>",
