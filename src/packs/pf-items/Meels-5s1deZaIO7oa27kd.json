They range in size from only a few pounds to specially crafted lead or stone meels which weigh as much as a human. This set contains three wooden meels of more common dimensions. Athletes practice with meels by taking a club in each hand and swinging them in a rhythmic fashion around the body. Training with a set of meels requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 10 Strength check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks and treat your Strength score as 1 higher for the purpose of determining your carrying capacity. This bonus lasts for 24 hours.</p>",
