When loaded with a splash weapon or a vial of poison (contact or inhaled poisons only) and armed as a full-round action, an angry jack attacks the next creature to open the box, using its spring-loaded interior to launch that item at the target as a ranged touch attack (attack bonus +0). A creature struck by a contact poison in this way is exposed to the poison as normal, but a creature is automatically exposed to a loaded inhalation poison with no attack roll needed. Identifying an angry jack requires a successful a DC 20 Perception check. A character who is trained in the Disable Device skill can spend 10 minutes disguising an armed angry jack, allowing her to roll a Disable Device check and use the result as the Perception DC for others to detect the true nature of the angry jack. The user can't take 10 or 20 on the Disable Device check.</p>",
