      "value": "<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Heroes of the Darklands pg. 31</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 50 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1 lb.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Tools</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2><p>Created by dwarves after the Quest for Sky, this faintly glowing collection of minerals allows photosynthetic plants to grow in underground environments without sunlight. Sunsoil has since spread to a handful of agricultural communities throughout the Darklands, particularly among duergar plantations and svirfneblin enclaves. One pound of sunsoil covers a 20-footby- 20-foot area of regular earth and takes 1 minute to distribute evenly. A treated area allows plants to grow without sunlight for 4 months. Light-based spells and magical effects trigger an alchemical reaction in sunsoil. Any spell with the light descriptor cast on a pound of sunsoil causes all areas covered in the soil to be treated as areas of bright light for 1 round. This light counts as natural sunlight for creatures vulnerable to such effects. After being subjected to such an effect, sunsoil immediately becomes normal dirt.</p>",
