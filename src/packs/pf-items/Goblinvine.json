On a failure by 5 or more, the leaves become torn and ruined. If gloves or gauntlets aren't worn, the preparer is automatically exposed to the goblinvine's effects. If the preparation check's result is a natural 1, the preparer is exposed to those effects regardless of any hand protection worn. The goblin vine must then be stored in an area of bright light for at least 1 hour for the inner surface of the leaves to properly 'sweat' and build up enough irritating oil to function as a thrown weapon.<br/><strong>Use</strong> Once woven into a tight ball of vines and left to sweat, a ball of goblinvine leaves can be used as an improvised thrown weapon as a ranged touch attack. On a hit, a target must succeed at a DC 10 Fortitude save or develop a distracting, itchy rash that imposes a -2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. This effect persists for 10 minutes or until the rash is tended with a successful DC 12 Heal check attempted as a full-round action. This is a poison effect, but creatures with the goblinoid subtype are immune to the effect. Innovative characters (including many goblins) have developed other uses for goblinvine, including as snares and ropes to make those bound or entangled itchy as well, but since goblinvine is relatively fragile, it makes for a very poor substitute for rope.</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbolN.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"The herbalism subsystem is not legal for play; instead a PC with at least one rank in Craft (alchemy) and 1 rank in either Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) can purchase the herbs in this book at a 10% discount that does not stack with other discounts; if a PC's ranks in these skills are 5 or higher, the discount increases to 15%, and if a PC's ranks in these skills are 10 or higher, the discount increases to 20%\"/>Description</h2><p>The leaves of this invasive creeper are wide and covered with tiny hairlike filaments.</p>",
