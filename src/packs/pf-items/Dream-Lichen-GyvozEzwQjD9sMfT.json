This requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check and 8 hours of work.<br/><strong>Use</strong> A creature that sleeps for at least 8 hours with a dose of dream lichen in contact with its body has vivid dreams in which it endures and recovers from a supernatural affliction. Upon waking, the creature can attempt a new saving throw against a single curse or mind-affecting effect from which it is currently suffering. Alternatively, the user automatically succeeds at a saving throw to remove a temporary negative level.</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbolN.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"The herbalism subsystem is not legal for play; instead a PC with at least one rank in Craft (alchemy) and 1 rank in either Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) can purchase the herbs in this book at a 10% discount that does not stack with other discounts; if a PC's ranks in these skills are 5 or higher, the discount increases to 15%, and if a PC's ranks in these skills are 10 or higher, the discount increases to 20%\"/>Description</h2><p>This multicolored, shimmering lichen grows in places where powerful magical creatures have slept and dreamt.</p>",
