A dose of nightsage burns for 10 minutes and can be extinguished and reignited for multiple uses (but it is always used in 1 minute increments, regardless of the actual time spent burning).<br/><br/>While nightsage burns, each corporeal undead creature within a 5-foot radius gains a +2 profane bonus on saving throws against positive energy effects (including channel energy effects). Necromancers are fond of supplying their undead minions with small thuribles containing a burning stick of nightsage that can be worn while carrying out their commands. A moderate or stronger wind extinguishes a burning stick of nightsage.</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbolN.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"The herbalism subsystem is not legal for play; instead a PC with at least one rank in Craft (alchemy) and 1 rank in either Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) can purchase the herbs in this book at a 10% discount that does not stack with other discounts; if a PC's ranks in these skills are 5 or higher, the discount increases to 15%, and if a PC's ranks in these skills are 10 or higher, the discount increases to 20%\"/>Description</h2><p>The fragrant purple blossoms of this night-blooming wildflower are so deep in hue that they appear almost black.</p>",
