Since this is impractical, alchemists developed a technique to store greater amounts of air in a smaller volume using pressure. Each pressurized air tank is a little smaller than half the size of a tank, but it contains enough air for a swimming character to breathe for 1 hour (the pressurized air itself weighs 7 pounds, so an empty tank weighs only 23 pounds). When a small crank is manipulated as a standard action, the tank releases just enough air for a breath, which the diving character breathes in through a straw-like tube with a semipermeable end piece that allows air out but not water in. The process of refilling the air tank requires 5 gp of materials and a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check (failure destroys the tank) or the services of a kineticist with basic aerokinesis.</p>",
