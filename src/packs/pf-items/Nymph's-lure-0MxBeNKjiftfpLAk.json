It is used in a rite of passage in certain hunter-gatherer societies, where young men and women are given a dose of the poison and sent into the wild to hunt game and prove their worth, but it is also used as a punishment in some places, with the condemned being given several doses of the poison and then forced into the wild without any weapons or equipment.</p>",
