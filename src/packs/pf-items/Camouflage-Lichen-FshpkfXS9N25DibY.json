Where other races would be appalled at the thought of plants taking root in their flesh, oreads see it as a natural and healthy extension of their elemental nature. For this reason, oread herbalists developed several strains of moss and lichen specifically adapted to grow on their bodies. Camouflage lichen is the most common variety of these oread plants. It takes 1 minute to apply a paste of camouflage lichen spores to the skin, and an additional 24 hours for the fungus to sprout. After this time, the oread is covered in a thin green layer of living plant matter, granting her a +4 bonus on Stealth checks made in green forest and jungle environments. Red-orange and white varieties exist, providing bonuses in appropriately colored environments (red-orange among autumn leaves or in red deserts, white in snow, and so on). Camouflage lichen has a short lifespan; it withers and dies 3 days after being applied, crumbling away into harmless powder. This item only works on oreads and other creatures with rocklike bodies.</p>",
