A single herbalist can prepare up to a dozen doses simultaneously in this manner. At the end of the week, a successful DC 15 Craft (alchemy) check results in all of the doses being ready for use; failure indicates that all the doses have spoiled.<br/><strong>Use</strong> When a dose of prepared leechwort is used in conjunction with a Heal check to stabilize a dying creature, provide longterm care, treat wounds from caltrops (or similar effects), or treat deadly wounds, it grants a +1 alchemical bonus on the Heal check. This increases to a +2 alchemical bonus on Heal checks to staunch bleeding.</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbolN.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"The herbalism subsystem is not legal for play; instead a PC with at least one rank in Craft (alchemy) and 1 rank in either Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) can purchase the herbs in this book at a 10% discount that does not stack with other discounts; if a PC's ranks in these skills are 5 or higher, the discount increases to 15%, and if a PC's ranks in these skills are 10 or higher, the discount increases to 20%\"/>Description</h2><p>When dried and ground into a powder, the mottled red-andgray bark of this shrub is a boon to healers.</p>",
