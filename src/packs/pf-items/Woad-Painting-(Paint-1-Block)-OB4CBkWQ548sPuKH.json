(kit), - (paint, 1 block)</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2><p>Though associated with the woad plant, the alchemical ingredients of this blue paste can vary considerably. When preparing a spell, you can grind the spell's material components and mix them into this paste to paint the components directly onto your flesh, allowing you to cast that spell as if you had applied Eschew Materials. Additionally, by painting complex woad designs that symbolize gestures for 10 minutes and succeeding at a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 15 + the spell level, you can also cast the spell as if you had applied Still Spell. You can have only one spell painted on you in this way at a time, and if you cast the prepared spell or the paint is removed for any reason, the effects of the woad paint are spent.<br/><br/> Woad paint is sold in small, concentrated blocks (costing 60 gp each) that must be ground into paste on a wooden or stone pallet with a small amount of water and material spell components. A typical kit contains a pallet and 5 small blocks of paint. One block produces enough paint for 10 component designs or one stilled spell design. Woad paint has no benefit for a non-spellcaster.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 30</p>",
