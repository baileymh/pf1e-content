Perfect ice is an alchemically engineered form of water that briefly converts any moisture it touches into a similar state. When a flask of perfect ice is opened or broken (such as by being thrown as a splash weapon), the snowflake within expands rapidly, forming a layer of ice and snow with a 60-foot radius along any nearby surface. Any living creature that touches an area of perfect ice or starts its turn in a space of perfect ice takes 4d6 points of damage from desiccation as some of the water in its body crystallizes (Fortitude DC 18 half). Creatures with the water subtype take half again as much damage (150%) and receive no saving throw. The ice crystals that form along flat surfaces are large and strong, and are treated as caltrops. The ice persists for 10 minutes, after which it vaporizes or reverts to a normal state for its temperature. To avoid the hazards of its large area of effect, many users propel the vial from a launching crossbow (<i>Pathfinder Player Companion: Adventurer's Armory</i> 4) or use similar means to extend their throwing range.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><b>Craft (Alchemy)</b> DC 25</p>",
