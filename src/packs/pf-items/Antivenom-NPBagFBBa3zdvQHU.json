      "value": "<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Wilderness pg. 143</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> varies; <strong>Weight</strong> -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Remedies</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2><p>While antitoxin, as presented in the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>, presents a generalized tool for protecting oneself from poison, more specialized antivenoms can provide even greater protection against specific poisons. Creating a dose of antivenom requires a dose of the specific poison that the antivenom is designed to protect against.<br/><br/> <strong>Antivenom Effects</strong>: A single dose of antivenom automatically neutralizes the first exposure of the specific poison it is made to combat and provides a +8 alchemical bonus on saving throws against additional exposure to that specific poison; this bonus decreases by 1 every hour, until the effect ends after 8 hours.<br/><br/> <strong>Crafting Antivenom</strong>: To create a dose of antivenom, a living creature must first be exposed to a half dose of the poison in question. The creature suffers the poison's effects normally, except the saving throw DC to resist the poison is reduced by 2. In order to be able to produce antivenom, the creature must succeed at the necessary saving throws to be cured of the poison. If the poison's duration expires without the creature being cured, no antivenom can be harvested. Once the creature has resisted the poison's effects, a viable sample of the creature's blood can be extracted with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) or Heal check. This blood must then be refined to extract the natural antibodies that combat the poison in a process that takes 1 hour and requires a successful Craft (alchemy) check (DC = 5 + the poison's saving throw DC). Success yields 1 dose of antivenom. Antivenom can also be harvested in the same fashion from a creature that has been afflicted by a full dose of poison, rather than a creature deliberately given a half dose for this purpose. Regardless of how much poison the creature is exposed to, the antibodies in its system can be harvested only for 24 hours after it has recovered from the poison.<br/><br/> <strong>Purchasing Antivenom</strong>: Antivenom is not particularly expensive, but because it is highly specialized, it can be difficult to find. A dose of antivenom has a market price equal to half the market price of a dose of the poison in question, but it is treated as though its price were five times the market price of the poison for the purposes of determining its availability in any given settlement. Alternatively, if 1 or more doses of the poison in question can be provided, most alchemists will supply as much antivenom as they can produce from the doses for a fee of 10% of the market price of the poison.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC varies</p>",
