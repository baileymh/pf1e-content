They're kept in place by locking hinges and crude gyroscopes that compensate for normal head movements. While the lenses are properly aligned, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise and Craft checks involving items that are small or highly detailed and on sight-based Perception checks when she uses an action to inspect something within 5 feet. However, the arms become misaligned if the wearer falls prone or is grappled, or if the helmet is damaged (hardness 5, 2 hit points). If the arms are misaligned, they lose their usefulness until readjusted (a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity).</p>",
