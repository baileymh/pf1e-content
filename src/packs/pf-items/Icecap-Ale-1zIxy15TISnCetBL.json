Icecap ale grants a +2 alchemical bonus to the drinker's Strength and Constitution for 1 minute, as well as a +4 alchemical bonus on saving throws against compulsions and fear. However, after this initial surge of energy, the drinker becomes fatigued and takes a -4 penalty on Dexterity- and Strength-based skill checks for 1 hour. In addition, the drinker loses all memory of events that transpired during the 1d4 minutes directly following consumption of a draught of icecap ale; a successful DC 20 Fortitude save negates this memory loss. Additional doses of icecap ale imbibed during the hour following an initial dose cause the drinker to become sickened for 1 minute (instead of gaining a bonus to Strength and Constitution) and to suffer all the negative effects of icecap ale.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Alchemical Recipe</h2><p><strong>Recipe</strong> (50 spirit of wine + 40 urea)/distillation; <strong>Craft</strong> 20<br/><strong>Time</strong> 1 week; <strong>Tools</strong> brewer's kit; <strong>Type</strong> alcohol</p>",
