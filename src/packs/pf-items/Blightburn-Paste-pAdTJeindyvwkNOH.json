Inside the compartment is a half-ounce of deep green paste. This paste is made of animal fat mixed with groundup blightburn. Once the box is opened, blightburn paste limits teleportation within 60 feet and irradiates anyone within 60 feet, afflicting them with blightburn sickness (see sidebar for details on both effects). Any creature that touches the paste is afflicted with blightburn sickness (no save), and takes 2d6 points of fire damage per round until the paste is cleaned away with a successful DC 15 Heal check. Crafting this item requires a successful DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check. <br/> <h1>Blightburn</h1> The mineral blightburn is the deadliest radioactive substance in the Darklands. The green-glowing crystal burns anyone who touches it, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage per round of contact, and its radiation causes blightburn sickness. The substance also limits teleportation. Anyone casting a teleportation spell in or teleporting to a cavern with blightburn in its walls must succeed at a DC 30 caster level check.<br/> </p><h2 class=\"title\">Blightburn Sickness</h2><p> <strong>Type</strong> disease, contact (see text); <strong>Save</strong> Fortitude DC 22<br/> <strong>Frequency</strong> 1/day<br/> <strong>Effect</strong> 1d6 Con damage and 1d6 Cha damage; contact is automatic when a creature comes within a 60-foot radius, and can be blocked only by lead sheeting, 1 foot of stone, or a force effect; <strong>Cure</strong> 2 consecutive save<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 30</p>",
