If no event occurred during the last turn, this chance increases significantly.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some events can be negated, ended, or compensated for with some kind of kingdom check. Others, such as a rampaging monster, require you to complete an adventure or deal with a problem in a way not covered by the kingdom-building rules.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</text>\n\t\t\t"
