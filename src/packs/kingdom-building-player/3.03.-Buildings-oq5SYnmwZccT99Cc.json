Some buildings also intersect with the mass combat rules, notably with fortifications and reserve armies.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Demolition: </b>If a lot has a building, you can clear it for new construction. Doing so costs 1 BP. You may construct a building on a lot the same turn you demolish the old building there. You do not regain BP for a demolished building (but see Rebuilding, below).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Destroyed Lots: </b>If an event or a pillaging army destroys 1 or more lots, the devastation causes Unrest to increase per lot destroyed.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Rebuilding: </b>If you rebuild the same type of building on a destroyed lot, the cost is halved, as you can reuse some of the materials for the same purpose. If you rebuild a different type of building on that lot, reduce the cost of the new building by 1/4 the cost of the old building (minimum 1 BP). If you build smaller buildings on top of a site that held a multi-lot building, split the discount evenly over the new buildings.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</text>\n\t\t\t"
