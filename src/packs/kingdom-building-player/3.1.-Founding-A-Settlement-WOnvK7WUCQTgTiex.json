  "content": "<p>Before you can start your own kingdom, you first need a base of operations - a fort, village, or other settlement - where you can rest between adventures and where your citizens know they can find you if they need help or want to pay their taxes. Once you have a kingdom, you'll want to create more settlements in order for the kingdom to grow and prosper. To found a settlement, you must perform the following steps. (These steps assume you're building a new settlement from scratch; if you're attempting to incorporate an existing settlement into your kingdom, see Free City Terrain Improvement.)</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1 </strong>- Acquire funds. You'll need money and resources in the form of build points.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2 </strong>- Explore and clear a hex . You'll need to explore the hex where you want to put the settlement. See the Exploration Time column on Terrain and Terrain Costs (see below) to see how long this takes. Once you have explored the hex, clear it of monsters and dangerous hazards. The time needed to clear it depends on the nature of the threats; this step is usually handled by you completing adventures there to kill or drive out monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3 </strong>- Claim the hex as yours. Once you have BP and have explored and cleared the hex, you can claim it. Spend 1 BP to do so; this represents setting up very basic infrastructure such as clearing paths, hiring patrols, setting up a tent city, and so on. This establishes the hex as part of your kingdom (or the beginning of your kingdom).</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4 </strong>- Prepare the site for construction . To put a settlement on a claimed hex, you'll need to prepare it. Depending on the site, this process may involve clearing trees, moving boulders, digging sanitation trenches, and so on. See the Preparation Cost column on Terrain and Terrain Costs (see below) for the BP cost. If your settlement is in a hex containing a canal, lake, ocean, river, or similar large body of water, you must decide which of your settlement's borders are water (riverbanks, lakeshores, or seashores) or land. Some types of buildings, such as Mills, Piers, and Waterfronts, must be adjacent to water.</p>\n<p>A new settlement consists of 1 district, represented by the District Grid map. Mark the four borders on the District Grid as land or water, as appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5 </strong>- Construct your first buildings . Construct 1 building in your settlement and pay its BP cost. If this is your kingdom's first settlement, you should start with an Inn, Shrine, Monastery, or Watchtower. In addition, you may also purchase and construct 1 House, Mansion, Noble Villa, or Tenement. If your first building is an Inn, you must construct a House or Tenement next to it, as building an Inn requires an adjacent House or Tenement.</p>\n<p>When you complete these steps, you've founded your settlement! If this is your first settlement, it's considered your kingdom's capital city.</p>\n<h1>Capital City</h1>\n<p>A kingdom should have a capital city - the seat of your power. Your first settlement is your capital. If you want to designate a different settlement as the capital, you may do so in Step 6 of the Edict phase. Your capital city primarily comes into play if your kingdom loses hexes. If you change the capital city, attempt a Stability check. Success means Unrest increases by 1; failure means Unrest increases by 1d6.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.kingdom-building-player.JWKZgqSZ2jmSEpxQ]{2.2.2.1. Terrain and Terrain Costs}</p>"
