In most cases, each lot represents numerous buildings of that type, rather than a single edifice.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Cost: </b>The cost in BP to construct the building.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Lots: </b>How many lots the building fills.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Kingdom </b>: Building modifiers to Economy, Loyalty, and Stability stack, affect your entire kingdom, and are ongoing from turn to turn. Modifiers to Unrest occur once when the building is completed. This category also lists any bonuses to Fame from having the building.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Discount: </b>Some buildings halve the cost of constructing a related type of building in the same settlement. This cost reduction applies only to the first constructed building of the types listed in this line. For example, an Academy halves the cost of your next Library in that settlement; if you build a second Library in that settlement, you pay the normal cost for it. If 2 buildings give the same discount, only one discount applies per new building, but you may construct 2 buildings at the discounted cost. For example, Market and Theater both halve the cost of an Inn; if your settlement has a Market and a Theater, you may construct 2 Inns at half cost (the Market discounts one, and the Theater discounts the other).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Limit: </b>This lists limitations on the number of buildings of this type, special requirements for adjacent buildings, or prohibitions against certain buildings being adjacent.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For most buildings, you can construct as many of them as you want in a settlement, but some are limited in the number that can be built per settlement or district. For example, you can only construct 1 Arena per settlement.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some buildings require that you construct them adjacent to at least 1 or 2 of a specific kind of building or feature of the settlement. For example, a Shop or Tavern must be adjacent to a House or Mansion. The required adjacent building can only count toward 1 building that requires it. For example, if you have a House and a Shop, that House can't be used to meet the requirement for another Shop or a Tavern; you have to construct a new House and use it to meet the requirement of the new Shop or Tavern.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some buildings cannot be adjacent to certain buildings. For example, you can't construct a Tannery next to a House, Mansion, Noble Villa, or Tenement. If you want to use a lot for this type of building, you must demolish all prohibited adjacent structures first (see Demolition).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you get overzealous in constructing a particular type of building in a settlement, the GM should feel free to add events to discourage this practice. For example, a settlement with too many Dumps is prone to otyugh and wererat attacks, and a settlement with too many Graveyards tends to have frequent undead attacks. This should not occur, however, if you build too many Houses, Parks, Tenements, or Waterways.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Upgrade To/From: </b>Some buildings can be converted into a more advanced form of the existing building, such as converting a Shrine into a Temple. To upgrade a building, pay the BP cost difference between the current building and the new building. Remove the modifiers from the old building and apply the modifiers from the new building. Upgrading counts as constructing a building for the purpose of the maximum number of buildings you can construct on your turn. You can't upgrade a building to a larger one if there isn't space in the District Grid for the building's new size.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Special: </b>This lists any other effect the building has, such as increasing Defense, the settlement's base value, or the output of a nearby Mine.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Magic Items: </b>This lists any magic item slot the building creates, which may be filled in the Upkeep phase (see Magic Items in Settlements). If a building lists multiple options within a category (such as \"1 minor potion or wondrous item\"), it has an equal chance for each option.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Settlement: </b>This lists settlement modifiers from page 205 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide that affect specific skills within the settlement. These modifiers are ongoing from turn to turn, but apply only to skill checks within that settlement (not other settlements in the hex or anywhere else in your kingdom). Note that the GameMastery Guide also uses a settlement statistic called Economy; to avoid confusion with the Economy kingdom score, this book renames the Economy settlement statistic \"Productivity.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Note: </b>These buildings are tokens within the Kingdom Building token folder. You can drop these onto a district grid to represent the various grids of your city.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Academy (52 BP, 2 Lots)</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>An institution of higher learning that can focus on any area of knowledge or education, including magic.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Kingdom </b>Economy , Loyalty</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Upgrade From </b>Library; <b>Upgrade To </b>University</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Magic Items</b></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Settlement </b>Lore , Productivity , Society ; increase Lore bonus for questions relating to one Knowledge or Profession skill</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Alchemist (18 BP; 1 Lot)</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The laboratory and home of a creator of potions, poisons, and alchemical items.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Kingdom </b>Economy</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Limit </b>Adjacent to 1 House</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Special </b>Base value</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Magic Items</b></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Arena (40 BP, 4 Lots)</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A large public structure for competitions, demonstrations, team sports, or blood sports.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Kingdom </b>Stability ; Fame</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Limit </b>1 per settlement</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Upgrade From </b>Theater</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Settlement </b>Crime</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Bank (28 BP, 1 Lot)</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A secure building for storing valuables and granting loans.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Kingdom </b>Stability; Fame</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Special </b>Base value</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Bardic College (40 BP, 2 Lots)</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A center for artistic learning.
