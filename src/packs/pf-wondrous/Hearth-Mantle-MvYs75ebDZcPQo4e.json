Hearth mantles a re f avored b y t he faithful of Erastil, particularly those among his worshipers who rely upon the hunt for their livelihood. With a hearth mantle, one never has to worry about building a campfire in the wild.  A hearth mantle's wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against fire-based effects; the mantle itself is immune to fire damage. Once per day, the wearer can cause the leather exterior of the mantle to smolder for 1 minute. While smoldering, the hearth mantle sheds light as a torch.  If the user takes a full-round action to carefully spread a hearth mantle on the ground with its exterior facing up, a campfire ignites on the mantle's fire rune. This campfire burns for 8 hours and requires no fuel. Any creature that sleeps within 20 feet of the mantle for the full duration of the campfire recovers a number of hit points equal to twice its character level, as if it had undergone complete bed rest for a full 24 hours. The campfire is automatically extinguished if the hearth mantle is picked up, but can also be extinguished through normal means.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, nap stack, produce flame</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 87",
