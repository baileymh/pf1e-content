      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The snakelike mouthpiece of the Dominion has a fanged mouth for a head and a trachea for a tail. Though not mobile, the mouthpiece periodically thrashes and bites. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a mouthpiece of the Dominion can be forced into or pulled out of the throat of a Small or Medium creature that is willing or helpless. Installing or removing a mouthpiece deals 2 points of Constitution damage to the wearer.  The mouthpiece of the Dominion m erges w ith t he wearer's own mouth and throat. The wearer gains a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if the wearer is Small). If the wearer already has a natural bite attack, its damage is increased by one step. In addition, the wearer gains a +1 bonus to the DC of his audible bardic performances and any sonic or language-dependent spells and spell-like abilities he uses.  Any neh-thalggu within telepathic range of the wearer can speak audibly through the mouthpiece of the Dominion. If multiple creatures wish to speak at the same time (either the wearer or one or more neh-thalggus), they must make opposed Charisma checks to determine who controls the mouthpiece each round. When speaking through the mouthpiece, a neh-thalggu can have any audible bardic performance or any sonic or language-dependent spell or spell-like ability it uses originate from the wearer instead of itself. These effects have their DC increased by the mouthpiece.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, beast shape I, magic mouth</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 88",
