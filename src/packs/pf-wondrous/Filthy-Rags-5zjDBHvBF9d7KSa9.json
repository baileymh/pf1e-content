      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>These ragged robes are threadbare and frayed, caked with dirt and grime. Through constant exposure to innocuous forms of disease, the wearer becomes inured to sickness and filth, gaining a +4 alchemical bonus on saving throws versus disease and effects that cause the nauseated or sickened condition. Filthy rags can be worn in conjunction with armor.  10th Level: The rags begin to crawl with insects and spiders, granting the wearer familiarity with the feeling of tiny creatures crawling over her body. After wearing the rags for 24 consecutive hours, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against the distraction ability of swarms. Once per day, she can make the spiders in her rags swarm out and attack her foes, causing the rags to expel spiders as the spell vomit swarm.  11th Level: Wasps build a small hive somewhere in the rags' interior. When the wearer uses vomit swarm, she can choose between spiders and wasps.  13th Level: The rags' diseases become more communicable. Any living creature striking the wearer with a bite attack contracts filth fever. A successful DC 14 Fortitude negates the disease. Oozes and vermin are immune to this effect, as are creatures such as otyughs and rats that are at home in exceptional filth.  16th Level: Army ants build a colony within the rags, and the rags' filth becomes utterly vile. The wearer can also choose army ants when using vomit swarm. Any biting creature that fails its saving throw against the rags' filth fever becomes nauseated for 1d4 rounds, and even on a successful save, the creature is still sickened for 1 round.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, contagion, remove sickness, stinking cloud, vomit swarmARG</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
