      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This flowing, black silken cloak glitters with an iridescent sheen like the feathers of a crow's wing. When the wearer moves, the fabric seems to dance on the air, as though it longed to take flight. The wearer can speak with birds while wearing the cloak, as if under the effects of speak with animals. Druids of northern Avistan have long favored these cloaks as a means of communicating with birds of the region, but they grew increasingly popular among several sects in Lirgen as well in the decades leading up to the Age of Lost Omens- despite the fact that crows themselves are not native to that particular land. Certainly, the exotic nature of the ebon feathers had an aesthetic appeal, for in a land where brightly colored songbirds were the norm, the concept of a midnight black avian couldn't help but to be somewhat intriguing to the residents.  As a move action, the wearer of a crow brother's cloak can command the item to dissolve into a swirling murder of crows, which faithfully surround the wearer for up to 13 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive. The murder of crows functions as a bat swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 30). The murder of crows deals no damage to the wearer and provides concealment as long as the wearer remains within it. As a free action, the wearer can recall the swarm into cloak form or issue it a simple command (such as to direct its movement or to instruct it to follow the wearer). If the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, it returns to its cloak form immediately and cannot be transformed again for 24 hours.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, speak with animals, summon swarm</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Seers Of The Drowned City",
