      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Orcs turn the bodies of their slain enemies into these kettle-like drums, using the foes' skins for the drumheads and the femurs as the drumsticks. The drums come with a harness that is worn across the shoulders and back so that the drummer can play and walk simultaneously.  When war drums of savagery are beaten rhythmically during battle, all of the drummer's allies within 60 feet of the drums who can hear the pounding gain the effects of the rage spell. This effect lasts for as long as the drummer continues to play, but once the drumming stops, the effect can't begin again for 1 day. Allies who move within 60 feet of the drums after the drumming has begun but while they're still sounding gain the benefits of the effect. Any allies who move out of range of the drums temporarily lose the benefits of effect, but they regain the benefits when they move back within range of the drums.  If the drummer plays the war drums of savagery as part of a bardic performance, those affected by the rage effect don't take the penalty to AC as long as the drummer's bardic performance continues.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, rage</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Monster Codex",
