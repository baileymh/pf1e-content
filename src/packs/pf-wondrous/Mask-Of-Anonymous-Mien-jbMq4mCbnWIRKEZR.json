      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This featureless mask is little more than a white disk with eyeholes and a pair of short leather straps for tying. After donning the mask, the wearer can meditate for 1 minute in order to assume a faceless identity, becoming an utterly generic and unremarkable member of the wearer's race and gender. Knowledge checks about the wearer's faceless identity don't reveal information about his true identity, unless his true identity is revealed to the world at large. Additionally, attempts to scry or otherwise locate the wearer work only if the creature is attempting to locate the wearer's faceless identity (or the creature knows the wearer's faceless identity and the wearer's true identity are one and the same). Otherwise, the spell has no effect, revealing nothing but darkness, as if the target were invalid or did not exist. In addition, if the wearer owns multiple masks of anonymous mien, the faceless identity he assumes is the same for all such items.  A vigilante who wears a mask of anonymous mien treats the faceless identity created by the item as a vigilante identity for the purpose of his class abilities, although this identity is separate from his actual vigilante identity.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, alter self, nondetection</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Spymaster's Handbook",
