      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This leather harness has four clockwork arms attached to it. When it's worn, the arms are positioned behind the wearer's shoulders, with one pair slightly higher than the wearer's and the other set slightly lower, and they spring to life and move under the wearer's control. The arms lack the agility to aid in casting spells, crafting, picking locks, or completing any other fine motor skill, and can't use items placed in their hands. However, each arm's hand can hold any item the wearer could hold in one hand, allowing the wearer to have up to six total pieces of equipment ready for use at once. Once per round as a free action, the wearer can switch which items are held by which hands. Weapons wielded by the arms can't be used for most attacks but can take advantage of a foe's distraction or lowered guard-each clockwork arm wielding a weapon can make one attack of opportunity per round, and all such attacks are treated as off-hand attacks.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, animate objects</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Melee Tactics Toolbox",
