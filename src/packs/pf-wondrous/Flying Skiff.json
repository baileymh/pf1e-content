      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>A flying skiff is a long, flat-bottomed vehicle akin to a naval ship, and is covered in metallic veins. Without a psychic pilot, a flying skiff acts in all regards as a keelboat (Pathfinder RPG  Ultimate Combat 184). A single Large direct-fire siege engine can be mounted on the front of a flying skiff.  A control helmet that fits a Small, Medium, or Large creature is linked by long, curling cables to the metal veins of the skiff. Whenever a psychic creature (one with levels in an occult class, the Psychic Sensitivity feat, or the ability to use psychic spell-like abilities) wears the control helmet, the flying skiff gains the following abilities.  • The skiff can fly with a maximum speed of 100 feet and acceleration of 30 feet.  • The skiff gains fast healing 5 when reduced below half its starting hit points. Damage above this threshold must be repaired normally.  Along with the abilities granted to the flying skiff when piloted by a psychic creature, the pilot gains the following additional abilities.  • Anytime the pilot casts one of the following psychic spells, the spell affects the entire crew of the flying skiff: intellect fortress, mental barrier, thought shield, and tower of iron will. This includes all variants of these spells. The effect ends for a creature that departs the skiff before the spell's duration ends.  • The pilot can aim and fire the siege weapon on the flying skiff with her mind (using the same number of actions this would normally take). This does not grant her the ability to reload the siege weapon with her mind.  • Once per day, the pilot can take a full-round action to transport the flying skiff and all crew onboard as plane shift.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, intellect fortress III*, mental barrier III*, overland flight, plane shift, thought shield III*, tower of iron will II*</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Occult Adventures",
