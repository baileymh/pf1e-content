      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This regal-looking robe is trimmed with softly glowing sigils and attuned to one of three types of alignment. It can have geometric sigils (1-45 on d%, lawful alignment), smooth sigils (46-75 on d%, neither lawful nor chaotic alignment), or jagged sigils (76-100 on d%, chaotic alignment). To most wearers, the robe offers no powers and has no effects unless the wearer's alignment doesn't match that of the robe (see below). Only a psychic spellcaster can call upon this potent magic item's powers, which are as follows.  • The wearer gains DR 2/-.  • The wearer gains spell resistance 18.  • The wearer gains a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws.  • The save DCs of all spells with the mind-affecting descriptor cast by the wearer increase by 1.  If a robe with geometric sigils is donned by a chaotic character, he immediately gains 3 permanent negative levels. The same is true with respect to a robe with jagged sigils donned by a lawful character. A lawful or chaotic character who puts on a robe with smooth sigils, or a neutral character who dons a robe with geometric or jagged sigils, gains 2 permanent negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the garment is worn and cannot be overcome in any way (including through restoration spells). Negative levels are immediately removed if the robe is removed from the wearer.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, antimagic field, mage armor, creator must be of same alignment as robe</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Psychic Anthology",
