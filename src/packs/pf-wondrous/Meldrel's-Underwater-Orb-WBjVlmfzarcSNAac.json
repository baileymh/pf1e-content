      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This unpolished pearlescent stone, roughly 6 inches in diameter, contains an airless cyst of seawater with the preserved, pink-and-yellow body of a tropical fish, eyes agape, in the center. The stone once belonged to Meldrel Vallinia, an elven arcanist from the Shackles obsessed with the theory that terrestrial elves must have the unconscious ability to transform into aquatic elves.  Meldrel spent most of his long life trying to learn how to unlock this supposed ability. He researched the locations of aquatic elven communities and magically traveled to their depths, hoping his underwater kin possessed the forbidden knowledge he sought. Ultimately, Meldrel found no real proof to support his theory, although he managed to weave the strange magic he learned along the way into his orb. The fish inside, Meldrel claimed, was a gift from an aquatic elven king.  An occultist of 7th level or higher who has learned the transmutation implement school and uses Meldrel's underwater orb as an implement can use the following focus power.  One with the Depths (Sp): As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to give yourself a swim speed of 30 feet, as well as a +8 bonus on Swim checks and the ability to take 10 on Swim checks even if distracted or endangered. You can also use the run action while swimming, provided you swim in a straight line. Additionally, this effect allows you to breathe water freely. This effect lasts for 1 hour per occultist level you have.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be a 7th-level occultist who has learned the transmutation implement school</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Occult Realms",
