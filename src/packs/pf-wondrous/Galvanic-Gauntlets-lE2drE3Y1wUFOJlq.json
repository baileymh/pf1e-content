      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>These gloves are woven of a fine copper mesh and wire, and infuse the wearer's hands with an electric charge. The wearer can use the galvanic gauntlets to make a melee touch attack dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage. She gains a +3 bonus on the attack if the target is wearing metal armor or is composed of metal.  7th Level: The touch attack's damage increases to 2d6 points of electricity damage.  9th Level: If the wearer uses her hands to make unarmed strikes (including when making a combat maneuver check to damage an opponent in a grapple), those attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage on each hit, as if she were using a weapon with the shock weapon special ability.  11th Level: Any item held in the wearer's hands gains a powerful static charge, and any creature attempting to disarm the wearer of an object she is holding (or to make a steal combat maneuver against the gloves themselves) takes 1d6 points of electrical damage and must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by the shock. This static charge does not harm items the wearer is holding.  13th Level: The shock ability of the gauntlets improves to the shocking burst weapon special ability.  15th Level: Once per day when the wearer hits a creature with the gauntlets' touch attack, she can create electric arcs that strike nearby creatures. This functions as though the target  of the attack had been the primary target of a chain lightning spell (Reflex DC 19 half), though the hit creature doesn't take any additional damage.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, chain lightning, shocking grasp</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
