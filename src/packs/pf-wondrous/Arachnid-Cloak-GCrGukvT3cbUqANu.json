      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This red-and-violet silk garment, delicately embroidered with a barely perceptible weblike pattern, grants its wearer a +2 luck bonus on saving throws against spider poison.  7th Level: The cloak allows its wearer to move at half speed among spider webs without any chance of being trapped by them.  10th Level: The wearer is treated as if constantly under the effects of a spider climb spell.  12th Level: The wearer cannot be entrapped by web spells or webs of any sort, and can climb along webs like a spider, moving at her full climb speed.  14th Level: Normal spiders, including spider swarms and  unusually large spiders, will not attack the cloak's wearer unless she attacks them first or they are instructed to do so by some other creature, such as through a use of vermin empathy or a spell. The cloak's wearer can summon forth a swarm of spiders once per day as the spell summon swarm.  16th Level: The cloak's wearer can attempt to influence spiders, as the mite's vermin empathy ability. The wearer does not gain a racial bonus to vermin empathy. She can change into the form of a Small or Medium spider and back at will as a standard action, as vermin shape I.  17th Level: The cloak's wearer can summon a swarm of spiders at will, instead of once per day. When she changes into the form of a spider, she can change into the form of a Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large spider as vermin shape II.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, spider climb, summon swarm, vermin shape II, web</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
