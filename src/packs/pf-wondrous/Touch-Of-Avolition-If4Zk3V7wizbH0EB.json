      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This thin disk of woven material is 2-1/2 inches in diameter. From its edges protrude fine, hair-like fibers about half an inch long. A touch of avolition is in fact an example of mi-go technology-as much fungus as anything else. Creatures like mi-go can handle a touch of avolition with ease, but humanoids and other fleshy users must wear gloves to avoid becoming the target of the item's effect. Applying a touch of avolition requires a successful touch attack. When placed against flesh (any living, corporeal, non-plant or non-ooze creature), a touch of avolition's fibers swiftly merge with the target unless the creature succeeds at a DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim becomes paralyzed for 7 rounds. It can attempt a new Fortitude as a standard action after the first round to end the effect early.  Once a victim recovers from the paralysis effect, the touch of avolition saps the user's willpower and dulls the senses, making creatures under these effects easier to mentally manipulate. The victim's Wisdom is reduced by 6 (minimum 1) as long as the touch of avolition remains attached. The fungal filaments of a touch of avolition dig deep, and merely ripping the patch free from the skin doesn't remove this Wisdom penalty, though the removal itself deals 1d4 points of damage to the victim. The effect is a curse effect, and it (and the paralysis) can be removed as such via remove curse or similar spells.  A touch of avolition works best when damp. The save DC to resist a dry touch of avolition is 10, its paralysis effect lasts for only 2 rounds, and its Wisdom penalty is reduced to 2. The effects of multiple touches of avolition do not stack.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, bestow curse, hold person</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 88",
