      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>A detailed bronze figurine of a crowned honeybee adorns this iron choker. The first chokers of this type were created by a cabal of gnome priests of the Eldest from the Abendego Coast, who believed pain could forestall the bleaching.  When this choker is placed on a living creature's neck, the bee springs to life and latches itself to the wearer, embeds its stinger deep into her neck, and fills the wearer's throat with swarming bees. Although it produces a disconcerting feeling, this sting and the bees do no harm to the wearer other than to give her voice an aggressive buzzing quality that grants her a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks.  Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can swallow some of the bees in her throat as a swift action, which coats her throat in soothing, golden honey. For the next hour, her voice sounds silken and smooth, and she gains a +2 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks rather than on Intimidate checks.  Finally, the wearer can release the entire swarm as a standard action once per day. When she does so, she exhales a 15-foot cone of angry bees from her mouth. Those caught in the cone take 4d6 points of piercing damage and are staggered by the painful stings for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 16 Reflex saving throw halves the damage inflicted and negates the staggered condition.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, eagle's splendor, vomit swarm</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Seers Of The Drowned City",
