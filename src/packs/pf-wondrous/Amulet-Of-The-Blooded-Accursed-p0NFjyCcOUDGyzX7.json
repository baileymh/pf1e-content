      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Each different type of amulet of the blooded grants its wearer powers from one sorcerer bloodline, but makes him vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with the appropriate bloodline (such as a blood-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated bloodline wears the amulet, the wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of his bloodline powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of bloodline powers.     Accursed: This swirling green malachite hangs from a chain of oxidized copper. Sinister, unblinking eyes are etched upon its surface. The wearer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against charm, cold, fear, fire, and sleep effects. Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer can fix his gaze on any one creature within 60 feet. The target becomes staggered for 4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC 18). Only one target can be affected by the wearer's gaze at a time; if the wearer attempts to stagger a new opponent, the previous target immediately recovers whether the new attempt is successful or not.
