      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This wayfinder is constructed of delicate ivory. Its face constantly reshapes to form a relief of its bearer, and is capable of changing as quickly as two creatures can pass the wayfinder back and forth. The socket in which an ioun stone could normally be placed is instead filled with a permanently fixed gem that functions as a ring of minor spell storing. After wielding this wayfinder for 24 hours, its wielder can designate a series of conditions upon which the wayfinder will cast the highest-level spell stored in the gem with the wearer as the spell's target, as though it were using the contingency spell. For example, the wielder of a contingent wayfinder could place a cure moderate wounds spell in the wayfinder's gem, then specify that if she ever falls unconscious because of lethal damage, the spell must be cast on her. Once used in such a manner, the wayfinder requires 1 month to recharge its contingency effect, though a new spell can be cast into the enclosed gem at any time during this period. If the conditions of the contingency effect are not met within 1 week of when they were assigned, the user can change the conditions, though the spell stored in the gem can't be changed until it has been cast.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, contingency, imbue with spell ability, light</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Society Primer",
