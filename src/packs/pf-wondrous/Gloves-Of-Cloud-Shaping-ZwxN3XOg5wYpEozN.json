      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The wearer of these cloud-blue, cool-to-the-touch gloves can sculpt and shape creations of cloud and mist- both her own and those of others. The wearer can call upon the power of the gloves up to three times per day when creating a cloud of gas or mist with a spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or magical item in order to make the area of effect shapeable (Core Rulebook 215).  Alternatively, the wearer can use the gloves to disperse an existing cloud of gas or mist by touch, as if using dispel magic. If the effect is nonmagical, it is automatically dispersed in a 20-foot-radius spread centered on the wearer.  10th Level: The wearer can use fog cloud twice per day.  12th Level: The wearer can disrupt a creature under the effects of gaseous form. To do so, she must succeed at a melee touch attack against the gaseous target. If the attack hits, the wearer can choose to either lock the gaseous creature in place as if using hold monster or disperse the target, dealing 5d6 points of damage and nauseating the target for 5 rounds. In either case, the target is also locked into its gaseous form and can't resume solid form until the effect expires. A successful DC 17 Will saving throw negates this effect.  14th Level: The wearer can use cloudkill once per day.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, cloudkill, control weather, fog cloud</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
