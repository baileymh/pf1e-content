      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Typically crafted of bronze, brass, or copper with an upper section of silver or mithral, a censer of dreams protects sleeping minds from the fell influence of magical nightmares. A censer of dreams can burn any type of incense as per a normal censer, but can also be commanded to emit lavender-scented fumes that fill a 30-foot-radius spread for up to 8 continuous hours per day, as long as the censer remains immobile. Strong winds disperse this effect, and moving the censer causes the effect to end immediately, but otherwise, any creature that sleeps in this area gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws made against dream-or nightmare-related effects, such as the nightmare spell or the effects of the nightmares caused by the abysium reactor in this adventure. A night hag cannot use her dream haunting ability in an area under this effect, and at the GM's discretion, the effect can block other strange effects that target sleeping or dreaming minds. All creatures who sleep for the full 8 hours in this area awaken particularly refreshed, having had pleasant dreams in which they explored idyllic landscapes and spoke with charming and eccentric creatures. Upon awakening, these subjects heal as if they'd taken complete bed rest for an entire day and night (recovering twice their character level in hit points).<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, dream</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 65",
