      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Made of aged bronze and steel, this ring looks like it should have a gem set in it, but instead has an empty circular hole.  The hole in the ring holds a single firearm bullet; if one is placed inside (as a full-round action), it merges seamlessly into the ring. While a bullet is merged into the ring, the wielder can fire the bullet as though she were using a +1 pistolUE that can't misfire. Once the bullet has been fired from the ring, a new bullet can't be placed inside for 24 hours.  Each holdout ring is created with two +1 ammunition special abilities and one +2 ammunition special ability.  If the wearer has the grit class feature, she can expend grit (maximum 4 grit points) to imbue bullets merged with the gun with one or more of these abilities. Imbuing a bullet with a +1 special ability costs 1 grit point; imbuing one with a +2 special ability costs 2 grit points. Each ring's special abilities are established upon the item's creation and can't be changed. If a special ability has multiple versions, as does bane, the specific version must be set at that time (e.g., dragon bane). A typical holdout ring has the flaming, seeking, and shocking burstUE special abilities.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Forge Ring, magic weapon, telekinesis, creator must meet  the requirements for the ammunition special abilities that  can be imbued by the ring</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Inner Sea Combat",
