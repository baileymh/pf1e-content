      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Fashioned of dark brown or black cloth, this cloak resembles gigantic bat wings. It allows its wearer to hang upside down from the ceiling like a bat.  7th Level: The cloak grants its wearer a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks.  10th Level: The wearer can grasp the edges of the cloak to fly (as the fly spell) for up to 7 minutes three times per day, but only in dim light or lower. After each use of this ability, the wearer must wait for at least as long as the fly effect lasted until using this ability again.  12th Level: For each daily use of fly, the wearer can instead choose to transform into an ordinary bat as beast shape III for the same duration.  14th Level: The wearer can use fly or beast shape III any number of times per day, but is still subject to the dim light restriction and the limit on using the ability again after a previous use.  16th Level: The wearer can also transform into a dire bat with beast shape III, and he can summon a swarm of bats at will as summon swarm.  18th Level: The wearer constantly gains the echolocation of a bat. He can hear high-pitched sounds such as bat echolocation, and he gains blindsense 20 feet. This blindsense is sound-based, and is blocked by spells such as silence.  20th Level: The wearer's blindsense increases to blindsense 60 feet, like that of a dire bat. Instead of using beast shape or fly, he can transform himself into a bat swarm, gaining the abilities of a bat as beast shape III plus the bat swarm's distraction, immunity to weapon damage, swarm traits, and wounding abilities.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, beast shape III, echolocationUM, fly, summon swarm</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
