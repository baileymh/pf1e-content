      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The wearer of these ornate crystal lenses gains a +6 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks. When she uses Sense Motive to determine whether someone is lying to her, she gets a brief flash of the liar's thoughts at that instant.  9th Level: When the wearer concentrates, she can perceive the thoughts of a single creature as writing in the air, rendered in the subject's native language. This functions as though the wearer had concentrated on the creature for 3 rounds using detect thoughts, and can be blocked with a successful Will save with a DC equal to the wearer's character level + 6 (to a maximum DC of 20). A creature that succeeds at its save can't be affected again for 24 hours. Maintaining concentration requires a standard action each round (as for a spell), and once the wearer ceases concentrating on a creature, she cannot observe thoughts again for 1 minute. This ability can be used for a total of 5 minutes per day. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments. The glasses fail to function against creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower or without a written language.  11th Level: The competence bonus on Sense Motive checks increases to +8. The detect thoughts effect can be used for 10 minutes per day. In addition to seeing the creature's thoughts in its native language, the wearer gets visual impressions of the creature's thoughts. She might see the face of someone the creature is thinking about, for instance, or see an image of that creature stabbing someone if it's planning an attack.  13th Level: The competence bonus on Sense Motive checks increases to +10. The detect thoughts effect is constant-the wearer no longer needs to concentrate to maintain it, and there is no longer a limit on the number of rounds per day.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts, creator must have 10 ranks in Sense Motive</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
