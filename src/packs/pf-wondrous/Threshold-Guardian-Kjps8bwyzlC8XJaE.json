      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This wreath weaves garlic, wolfsbane, silver, and mandrake together to create a fetish capable of blocking nearly any type of creature.  Once placed over a doorway or other entrance, a threshold guardian prevents access by a specified type of creature. The user placing the wreath must spend 10 minutes concentrating on one creature type (or subtype in the case of humanoids and outsiders) from the list o f ranger favored enemies. Afterward, any creature of the chosen type or subtype trying to pass through the doorway (or another opening within 10 feet of the wreath) must attempt a DC 19 Will save. If the creature succeeds, it can move in and out without  hindrance, but if it fails, it can't move through the guarded threshold while the threshold guardian remains.  When a user places the threshold guardian, she can choose whether to block the chosen creature type or subtype in one direction or in both directions. A creature that attempts to cross the threshold several times doesn't receive additional saving throws; the results of the first saving throw stand as long as the threshold guardian is undisturbed, with no other limit on duration. Removing or destroying the threshold guardian (hardness 5, 10 hp) removes the effect. Creatures other than the one that placed a threshold guardian can't touch the threshold guardian, even with another held object, unless they succeed at a DC 19 Will save. Creatures can still attack the wreath with ranged attacks, though if placed cleverly, the wreath could have total cover from such attacks. Destroying the doorway on which it hangs causes the threshold guardian to cease functioning immediately.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, antilife shell, forbiddance</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Horror Adventures",
