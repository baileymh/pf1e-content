      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The eye of the overwatched is a 6-inch-wide stone ring inset with the symbol of a partly lidded eye. The flawless marble of onyx that's set as the eye's pupil contains glittering points of light that resemble stars.  Made from the exotic mineral called veinstone, the eye of the overwatched is an ancient amulet crafted by Ralzeros the Overwatched. While he lived, Ralzeros used his observatory to study the otherworldly forces that reside in the Dark Tapestry. In turn, those forces watched him, and he became increasingly paranoid as a result. Just before he disappeared following a duel with the Absalom mage Beldrin, Ralzeros constructed this amulet in hopes that it would protect him from his perceived spellcaster enemies.  He failed to create a traditional magic item, but an occultist who has learned the abjuration implement school and uses the eye of the overwatched as an implement can use the following focus power.  Spellarmor (Sp): As a swift action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to try to shake off unwanted magical effects. If you are under the effect of an enemy's  spell or spell-like ability when you activate this ward, you immediately receive a new saving throw with a +2 circumstance bonus. This focus power does not grant a saving throw if the original effect did not allow one.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be a 5th-level occultist who has learned the abjuration implement school</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Occult Realms",
