      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>These ornate military medals are awarded to crusaders and adventurers who excel and deserve commendation in the war against the Worldwound. A medal must be affixed to a worn article of clothing to function, but doesn't have to be worn visibly. Any number of righteous medals can be worn, but the effects of multiple medals of a single type don't stack. A righteous medal functions only if the wearer has legitimately achieved the feat for which she received the medal. As a swift action, the wearer can gain a +2 sacred bonus to the medal's associated ability score for 1 minute. In addition, each righteous medal grants a constant sacred bonus on one type of roll, as detailed below.   Righteous Medal of Agility: This triangular iron medal shows a demonic face surrounded by three swords. It is awarded to a hero who delivers a death blow to a demon in combat before that demon gets a chance to act in the combat. This medal is associated with Dexterity and grants a +1 sacred bonus on Initiative checks.   A mythic character who wears all six righteous medals gains one additional use of mythic power per day.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item; bless,  cat's grace</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 74",
