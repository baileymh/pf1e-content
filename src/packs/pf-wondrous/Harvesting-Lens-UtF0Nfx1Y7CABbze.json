      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This thick, intricate lens piece is covered in alchemical wiring. A small aperture on the side of the lens connects to a mundane glass vial, such as a vial used for potions. When slid onto the viewer's end of a telescope, a harvesting lens allows the telescope's user to harness the power of starlight or the void as she chooses.  When a vial is fitted to the lens and the telescope is aimed at a distant star in the night sky, the vial slowly fills with collected starlight. After 8 hours, the vial is filled with silvery liquid cosmic light. One filled and removed, the vial of starlight sheds light for 8 hours, as if it were affected by light. During this time, the vial can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. On a direct hit, the vial shatters in a blinding flash of light, affecting the target as a blinding ray (Fortitude DC 13 negates). If the vial misses, it breaks with no effect. Either way, a new empty vial must be attached to the harvesting lens to use it again.  Alternatively, a harvesting lens attached to a telescope can be pointed toward an empty, dark space between the stars. After 8 hours, the vial becomes full of thick, inky dark matter. For 8 hours after the vial of dark matter is filled and removed, an inky black haze surrounds any creature holding it, as the protective penumbra spell. A vial of dark matter can also be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon striking any solid body or surface, the vial breaks and releases a 10-footradius emanation of magical darkness that lasts for 3 minutes.  This effect otherwise acts as darkness.  Only vials that have been filled for 8 hours produce the above effects. Partially filled vials do not work.  Only one magical lens (such as this or a lens of starlight) can be attached to a telescope at a time.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, blinding rayARG, light, protective penumbraUM</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>People Of The Stars",
