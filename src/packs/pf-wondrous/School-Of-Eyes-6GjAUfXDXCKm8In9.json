      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This item is a flask of syrupy fluid with an eyeball floating in it. When a creature drinks the entire flask, 1d4 rounds later he is stunned for 1 round as 1d4+1 floating fish with large eyes for heads crawl out of his flesh. Once these eye-fish free themselves, they hover near the drinker, always staying in the drinker's square, and otherwise function as the eyes from a prying eyes spell, except they are Tiny rather than Fine. As long as the drinker has at least three of the fish in his square, he gains a +10 competence bonus on sight-based Perception checks. Every 1d6 x 10 minutes, 1d4+1 more eye-fish crawl out of his flesh, stunning him for 1 round each time. Each flask can produce up to 1d4+10 fish total; once this many have appeared, no more are created. The fish remain until they are destroyed or until 10 hours pass from the time the flask was used.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, prying eyes</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Ultimate Equipment",
