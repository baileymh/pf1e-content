      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>These unusual hand-mirrors allow the user to communicate with the spirits of the recently deceased, although such communication comes with great risk. On command, the user can look into the mirror and name a recently deceased individual, attempting to conjure the image of that person's spirit into the mirror.  There is a 70% chance that an attempt to contact a specific spirit succeeds. For each week that the specified creature has been deceased, this chance decreases by 10% (to a minimum of 0%). If the attempt is unsuccessful, the spirit mirror ceases to function for 1d4 days and can never contact that particular spirit. If the attempt is successful, the deceased person's image appears in the mirror, and the user can ask her up to three questions, as call spirit. The spirit also has the ability to telekinetically move objects within 20 feet of the mirror, as unseen servant.  This form of communication is highly dangerous, and allows malevolent spirits to attack the user. Each time the spirit mirror fails to contact a spirit, another spirit comes in its stead. Usually this spirit makes mischief by either giving inaccurate answers or by moving objects around, but there is a 10% chance that the spirit manifests as a random incorporeal undead and attacks the mirror's user.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, call spirit</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Occult Adventures",
