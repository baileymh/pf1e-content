      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Typically engraved with numerous skulls, this small metal coffer allows the safe transport of infectious substances of up to Tiny size. Closing the lid seals in the contents and holds them in stasis, rendering them immune to aging or any damage. In addition, any infectious material-such as the body of a creature that died of disease-is preserved for as long as the coffer is closed. A death's head coffer's dimensions are approximately 4 inches by 4 inches by 6 inches, so it can potentially hold several Tiny items.  A death's head coffer can spread infections between items. Any item placed into a coffer with a disease-ridden item (something capable of spreading a disease by contact) becomes infected with the same disease. For 1 week after being removed from the coffer, the newly infected item can spread the same affliction as the disease-ridden item to any creature that touches it. For example, if a coin is placed into a death's head coffer with a rat infected with the shakes, any creature that touches the coin must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become infected with the shakes as well.  After a death's head coffer is closed and then reopened, its magic dissipates, rendering the box completely mundane. Some death's head coffers feature complex locking mechanisms, which require successful Disable Device checks with a DC of 30 or higher to open.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, contagion, gentle repose</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Curse Of The Crimson Throne Chapter Appendix",
