Once per day, the wearer of a lesser glorious tabard can activate the tabard to gain a +2 sacred bonus to her AC and on saving throws for 10 minutes. Both bonuses apply only against attacks made or effects created by outsiders with the evil subtype or creatures with an evil aura.  A greater glorious tabard bears the symbol of the Glorious Reclamation in gold. It has all the powers of a lesser glorious tabard but can be used twice per day. In addition, whenever a greater glorious tabard is activated, all longswords within 20 feet shed light as per a torch and ignore the DR of evil creatures (except DR/epic) for 3 rounds. When a greater glorious tabard is used as a divine focus to cast a spell, the wearer does not need any material components that cost more than 5 gp.  A glorious tabard functions only for wearers who are both members of the Glorious Reclamation and followers of Iomedae.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, veil of heavenARG, weapons against evil (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods 245, greater glorious tabard only), creator must be member of Glorious Reclamation and follower of Iomedae</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 108",
