      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Each different type of amulet of the blooded grants its wearer powers from one sorcerer bloodline, but makes him vulnerable to attacks and effects that target creatures with the appropriate bloodline (such as a blood-hunting weapon). If a creature that already has the associated bloodline wears the amulet, the wearer does not gain the abilities listed below; instead, the effective level of his bloodline powers increases by 2. This effect does not stack with other abilities that increase the effective level of bloodline powers.   Celestial: This large, polished opal hangs from a chain of smoky gray steel. The wearer gains acid resistance 5 and cold resistance 5. Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer can unleash a ray of heavenly fire as a ranged touch attack, targeting any foe within 30 feet. Against evil creatures, the ray deals 1d4+4 points of damage. The damage is divine and not subject to energy resistance or immunity. The ray heals good creatures of 1d4+4 points of damage, but a good creature cannot benefit from the heavenly fire more than once per day. Neutral creatures are unaffected by the ray.
