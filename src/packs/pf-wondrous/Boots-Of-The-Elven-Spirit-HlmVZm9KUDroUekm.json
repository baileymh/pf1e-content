      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>These elegant, lightweight boots are durable yet soft in texture, being partially made of living leaves and other natural materials. They grant the wearer a +5 competence bonus on Acrobatics checks and allow her to treat the first square of difficult terrain she enters each round as if it weren't difficult terrain.  12th Level: The boots allow the wearer to ignore the adverse movement effects of difficult terrain entirely.  14th Level: The boots grant the wearer a +10-foot enhancement bonus to her base movement speed, and she leaves no tracks.  17th Level: The boots allow the wearer to walk so lightly that she doesn't trigger pressure plate traps and can walk across any surface-including water, but not air-as long as she ends her movement each round on a surface that can support her weight.  20th Level: The boots allow the wearer to gain the effects of haste for 10 rounds per day, as boots of speed. If the wearer also wears the cloak of the elven spirit (see page 171), the boots grant her the ability to use tree stride as the spell, entering up to 20 trees each day.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, expeditious retreat, feather step, haste, tree stride, creator must be an elf</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
