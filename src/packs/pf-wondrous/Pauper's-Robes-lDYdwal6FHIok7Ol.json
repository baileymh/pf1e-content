      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Dirt and grime from city streets cling to these dirty brown robes, covering them in an ever-present film of filth. A set of pauper's robes surrounds its wearer in mystery, making it difficult for creatures to remember details about him. Creatures that attempt to remember details of their interactions with the wearer of a set of pauper's robes must make a successful Will save to do so: recalling general details about the wearer (such as gender or race) requires a successful DC 13 Will save, and recalling more specific information (such as name, distinguishing features, or mannerisms) requires a successful DC 16 Will save. If the wearer of the robes takes any action that counts as an attack (as defined by the invisibility spell), creatures witnessing that action are immune to the memory-fogging influence of the pauper's robes for all interactions with the wearer over the next 24 hours.  As a standard action, the wearer of a set of pauper's robes can cause the garment to tarnish and dirty any valuables he carries, making jewelry appear to be little more than beads and twine or a magical sword look rusted and dull. Anyone who examines or interacts with such an object can see through the guise with a successful DC 13 Will save. This effect ends immediately once the object leaves the wearer's possession.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, disguise self, memory lapseAPG</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Heroes Of The Streets",
