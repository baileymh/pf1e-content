      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Each of these amulets is imbued with magic that allows it to protect its wearer against a very specific danger. A talisman triggers automatically as soon as the listed condition is fulfilled. Although talismans occupy the neck slot, up to three talismans can be worn on one cord or chain. Wearing multiple talismans in this way offers a greater variety of protection, but a wearer can benefit from only one talisman's effect at a time. If another talisman would be triggered while its wearer is under the effect of another talisman, that talisman is not triggered and can still be used later.  A lesser talisman carries only enough magical energy to protect its wearer once, after which it crumbles to dust.  Ankh Talisman: This cross has a loop at the top. When a living creature wears it as a talisman, it radiates a soft, golden glow. When the wearer is hit by a creature with the energy drain ability, he receives a saving throw to negate the energy drain, using the DC listed for the ability (which usually determines whether temporary negative levels become permanent). If the creature's energy drain allows an initial saving throw, the talisman grants a second saving throw if the wearer fails his initial saving throw. If he succeeds at the saving throw granted by the talisman, the talisman releases a blast of force that automatically hits the attacker (as per force punchOA).
