      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This colorful sash seems to be the sort normally worn by any common sailor or traveler, yet within its folds is a bountiful pocket. The wearer can reach into this hidden pocket and remove a piece of fruit a number of times per day equal to his character level. The type of fruit varies. One piece of fruit has enough nourishment and water to sustain one humanoid for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the fruit rots and cannot nourish anyone.  Once removed from its wearer, the sash doesn't produce fruit for anyone else for 24 hours. If redonned by its most recent wearer during that time, the sash resumes function normally (and the amount of fruit remaining within it isn't reset).  6th Level: Consuming a fruit produced from the sash cures a creature of 1 point of damage as if it were a goodberry. A given creature can recover a maximum of 8 hit points in this way in a 24-hour period.  8th Level: Three times per day, the wearer can draw forth a large, ripe piece of healing fruit that explodes when thrown. This functions as a splash weapon, but cures a target it hits of 1d6 points of damage and cures each creature it splashes on of 1 point of damage. This counts against the total number of pieces of fruit the sash can produce per day.  10th Level: Once per day, the wearer can draw forth one piece of fruit that acts as a potion of cure moderate wounds, delay poison, lesser restoration, or remove paralysis. This counts against the total number of pieces of fruit the sash can produce per day.  13th Level: The fruits produced by the sash cure 1d4 points of damage each instead of 1 point. An exploding fruit's healing power is unchanged.  15th Level: Once per week, the sash can produce the effects of heroes' feast.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, create food and water, cure moderate wounds, delay poison, goodberry, heroes' feast, lesser restoration, remove paralysis</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
