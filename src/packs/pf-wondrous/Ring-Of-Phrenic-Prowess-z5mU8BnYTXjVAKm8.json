      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This ring is made of rough iron and is set with four amethysts. It allows a wearer with a phrenic pool to store up to 4 points from her phrenic pool in the ring as a swift action. These points remain in the ring until used. A wearer can spend points stored in the ring as if they were in her phrenic pool, in addition to the following uses.  As a free action, the wearer can expend 1 point stored in the ring to gain a +2 bonus on concentration checks for 1 round.  As a standard action, the wearer can expend 1 point stored in the ring to attempt to flood a target with raw psychic power. The wearer makes a melee touch attack charged with psychic energy. If the touch attack hits, it deals 3d6 points of nonlethal damage and the target is stunned for 1 round. If the attack misses, the charge dissipates.  As an immediate action, the wearer can expend up to 4 points stored in the ring to gain the benefit of spell turning for 1 round. The number of spell levels she can turn is equal to the number of points expended.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Forge Ring, spell turning, telepathic bond</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Psychic Anthology",
