      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This gilded neckpiece is inlaid with sunstone and diamond and engraved with wreaths of laurel. The wearer possesses great eloquence and gravitas, gaining a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Perform (oratory) checks.  10th Level: The wearer's speeches can fill her allies with purpose. As a full-round action, she can attempt a DC 20 Perform (oratory) check to affect all allies who can hear her with good hope for 1 round. If she fails the check, all allies who heard her ineloquent speech cannot benefit from this ability for 24 hours.  12th Level: The wearer can improve someone's attitude up to three steps when using Diplomacy. When she uses Intimidate to influence someone, she can present herself as glorious and powerful without threatening them, causing the attempt to operate like a Diplomacy check to influence instead.  14th Level: When the wearer uses the gorget's good hope ability, it lasts 1 additional round for every 10 by which her result exceeds the Perform (oratory) check DC. Once per day, she can extend the duration to the full duration of good hope.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, good hope</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
