      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Carved from a white stone in the shape of a coiled dragon, this ring grants its wearer cold resistance 5. The ring has a crisp smell that lingers when it protects its wearer.  11th Level: The ring grants cold resistance 10.  14th Level: The ring grants cold resistance 20.  17th Level: The ring grants cold resistance 30. The wearer can see perfectly in snowy conditions, and does not take any penalties on Perception checks while in snow. Once per day, the ring's wearer can make a primary bite attack as a swift action. If she does not   possess a bite attack, her teeth elongate into draconic fangs as part of the swift action, granting a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage for a Medium wearer (1d4 for a Small wearer).  20th Level: The ring's wearer can transform into a frost drake once per day. This functions as transforming into a white dragon via form of the dragon II, except that the wearer's cold breath weapon affects a 10-foot-radius spread within 60 feet of her. All surfaces within the spread are coated with slippery ice that turns the area into difficult terrain for 2d4 rounds.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Forge Ring, form of the dragon II, haste, resist energy</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
