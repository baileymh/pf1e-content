      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>These crystal-accented bracers are bound with metallic straps and a fine lacework of embedded wire. The wearer can cause the bracers to create a shield of force to protect him. Each bracer can create a shield for up to 10 total minutes per day. This duration must be used in 1-minute increments. If only one force bracer is used, it creates a buckler, light shield, or heavy shield of force. If the wearer activates both force bracers, the shield of force is the equivalent of a tower shield.  Regardless of which type of force shield is created, the shield is weightless and has only half the normal armor check penalty, but otherwise follows all of the normal rules for shield use and proficiency. The shield grants the corresponding shield bonus to AC. Because the shield is made of force, its bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks.  10th Level: If the wearer has created a heavy shield of force, the wearer can expend 1 minute of the shield's duration to make a single shield bash attack as if the shield had the bashing shield special ability, with an enhancement bonus on the attack roll equal to 1/4 the wearer's Hit Dice (maximum +5).  12th Level: If the wearer has created a tower shield of force, the wearer can release the tower shield from his person and use it as a forceful hand with hit points equal to 1/2 the wearer's hit points. The wearer gains none of the benefits of using a tower shield while the forceful hand exists. Each round of using the forceful hand consumes 1 minute of duration from each bracer.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, forceful hand, shield</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
