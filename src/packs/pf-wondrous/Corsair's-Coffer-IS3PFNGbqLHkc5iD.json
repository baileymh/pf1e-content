      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This huge-sized lacquered chest is bound in gold-plated steel, with three hasps for securing locks and spade-shaped feet. The chest is airtight when closed, and can be commanded to bury itself in dirt, loose soil, or sand. Once per day, the chest can burrow down between 10 and 30 feet. The process takes 1 minute for every 10 feet the chest travels. The chest stops digging once it reaches the desired depth, if it encounters solid stone, or if its path is blocked by any other obstruction. A buried chest can be commanded to dig back to the surface by a creature standing within 5 feet of the location beneath which it buried itself. The chest doesn't leave a usable tunnel, nor does it dig any direction other than down or back up.  The chest opens into an extradimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. This allows the chest to hold a large volume of material, to a maximum of 3,000 pounds and 500 cubic feet. The contents of the chest don't change its weight. Any effort to overload the chest fails, and items must be drawn from the chest intentionally; it's not possible to tip the chest over and spill its contents. Retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. As with the secret chest spell, magic items placed inside a corsair's coffer don't offer any benefit to characters carrying it. The chest is treated as a bag of holding for the purpose of determining what happens if placed in another extradimensional or nondimensional space. There's enough air for living creatures placed within the chest to survive for 20 minutes, after which time they begin to suffocate.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, move earth, secret chest</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Lost Treasures",
