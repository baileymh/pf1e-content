      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Members of Absalom's prominent houses sometimes employ this variant harrow deck (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 293) to communicate covertly with their fellow schemers. The deck includes the standard 54 cards plus an additional six trump cards. The trumps cards can be removed from the deck, which can then be used to perform normal harrowings.  As a standard action, the user can hand a trump card from the deck to a willing creature. By performing a variant  harrowing that involves only the user and takes 10 minutes to complete, the user can learn the name of the most recent spell or magic item used to divine information about the trump card's recipient or learn the content of messages sent concerning the recipient within 1 mile.  Once per day, the user can speak a command word to reveal the information carried by the most recent such divination or message, as well as an identifying feature of the caster or item user. The caster or item user can negate this intrusion with a successful DC 16 Will saving throw. (If the saving throw fails and the user later casts scrying or uses a similar magical effect targeting the caster or item user, the user is treated as if he had met the target.)  The recipient of the trump card can convey a simple message of up to 25 words to the deck's user by concentrating while tearing up the card as a standard action. The next variant harrowing performed as described above reveals the message instead of its usual effect. Once all six trumps have been destroyed, the deck loses its power. A trump card can be returned to the deck instead of being used to convey a message.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, detect scrying, sending</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Inner Sea Intrigue",
