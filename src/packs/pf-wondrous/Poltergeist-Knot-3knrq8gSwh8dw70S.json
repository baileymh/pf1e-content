      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This hopelessly knotted ball of golden twine defies any efforts to untangle it, forming new snarls out of nowhere  just when it appears to be nearly unraveled.  On command, the twine unrolls and snakes out through the air toward a target within 50 feet. Unless the target succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save to avoid the poltergeist knot, at the twine's touch, the bindings of any containers the target is carrying (packs, pouches, sheaths, quivers, and so on) come undone and all their contents are swept up in a whirlwind, performing a madcap dance around the target's head.  Anyone can grab an item as it spins by succeeding at a steal combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322) against a CMD of 12. In addition, the spinning objects obstruct the target's sight; other creatures gain concealment against attacks made by the target. The equipment moves with the victim, whirling around her head for 3 rounds before falling to the ground.  A poltergeist knot affects laces and buckles only on exterior containers-bottles in a pouch or a bag of caltrops in a backpack, for example, are swept into the whirlwind but don't spill their contents. The poltergeist knot works on inanimate objects, but can't open locks. A creature who isn't carrying a significant amount of gear may be immune to the poltergeist knot's effect, at the GM's discretion.  Once used, the knot loses its magic and becomes 50 feet of tangle, mundane twine.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, open/close, pilfering handUC</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Daughters Of Fury",
