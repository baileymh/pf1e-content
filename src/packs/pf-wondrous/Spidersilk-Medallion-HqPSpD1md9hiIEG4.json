      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This silvery ornament is shaped like a spider and worn on a thick strand of silk. The medallion is made from a tough but vaguely spongy and sticky substance, and it once belonged to the famed Ustalavic witch Morgellia, known for her spiderlike abilities and the spider swarms she commanded.  Morgellia was adept at using the silk from her scarlet spider familiar to create clothes, jewelry, and, when  necessary, particularly effective webs to trap her enemies. She fashioned this very medallion from that silk and wore it every day of her adult life. When she died, the magic from Morgellia's familiar leaked into the bauble, imbuing it with latent magic.  An occultist of 3rd level or higher who has learned the conjuration implement school and uses the spidersilk medallion as an implement has access to the following focus power.  Mindweave Web (Sp): As a standard action, you can expend 1 point of mental focus to create a web, as per the spell. This web lasts for 1 minute per occultist level you have. Creatures in the effect's area when the web is created can attempt a DC 15 Reflex saving throw to avoid being grappled. At 7th level, you can expend 1 additional point of mental focus when creating this web to render the entire web non-flammable. When you create a web in this way, its duration is reduced to 1 round per occultist level you have. Webs created using a spidersilk medallion cannot be made permanent.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be a 3rd-level occultist who has learned the conjuration implement school</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Occult Realms",
