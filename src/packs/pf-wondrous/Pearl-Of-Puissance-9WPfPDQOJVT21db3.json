      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This seemingly normal pearl of average size and luster holds the secret to endless magical power. It acts as a pearl of power (1st level), and the user gains a +1 bonus to her caster level when she casts the spell from the slot she recalled with the pearl.  9th Level: The pearl acts as a pearl of power (2nd level).  11th Level: The pearl acts as a pearl of power (3rd level).  14th Level: The pearl acts as a pearl of power (5th level), but it grants the +1 caster level bonus only if used to recall a spell of 4th level or lower.  15th Level: The pearl acts as a pearl of power (6th level), but it grants the +1 caster level bonus only if used to recall a spell of 5th level or lower.  16th Level: The pearl acts as a pearl of power (7th level), but it grants the +1 caster level bonus only if used to recall a spell of 6th level or lower.  17th Level: The pearl acts as a pearl of power (8th level), but it grants the +1 caster level bonus only if used to recall a spell of 7th level or lower.  19th Level: The pearl acts as a pearl of power (9th level), but it grants the +1 caster level bonus only if used to recall a spell of 8th level or lower. Alternatively, the pearl can act as a pearl of power (two spells), but when used in this way, it doesn't provide a caster level boost.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be able to cast 9th-level spells</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
