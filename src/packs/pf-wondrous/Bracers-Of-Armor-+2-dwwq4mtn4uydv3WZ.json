      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>These items appear to be wrist or arm guards, sometimes etched with symbols of protection or depictions of vigilant-looking animals. Bracers of armor surround the wearer with an invisible but tangible field of force, granting him an armor bonus of +1 to +8, just as though he were wearing armor. Both bracers of armor must be worn for the magic to be effective.   Alternatively, bracers of armor can be enchanted with armor special abilities. See Table 3-3: Armor Special Abilities for a list of abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. Bracers of armor cannot have a modified bonus (armor bonus plus armor special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +8. Bracers of armor must have at least a +1 armor bonus to grant an armor special ability. Bracers of armor cannot have any armor special abilities that add a flat gp amount to their cost. Bracers of armor and ordinary armor do not stack. If the wearer receives a larger armor bonus from another source, the bracers of armor cease functioning and do not grant their armor bonus or their armor special abilities. If the bracers of armor grant a larger armor bonus, the other source of armor ceases functioning.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, mage armor, creator's caster level must be at least two times that of the bonus placed on the bracers, plus any requirements of the armor special abilities</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Ultimate Equipment",
