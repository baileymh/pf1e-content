      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>A necklace of beast's might is a crude necklace made from a particular part (or close analog) of a creature of a specific type: aberrations, animals, dragons, fey, magical beasts, oozes (often made using hardened leftovers), or vermin. Regardless of the parts used to make the necklace, the necklace quietly rattles when a creature of the specific type is within 100 feet of the wearer.
