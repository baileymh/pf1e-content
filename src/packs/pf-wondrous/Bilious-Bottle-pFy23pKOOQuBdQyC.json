When a bilious bottle is opened or shatters, the foul fluid inside immediately expands into a 30-foot-radius cloud of noxious vapors. These vapors are invisible, but any creature within the area of effect of the cloud must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw at the start of its turn or suffer one of the following random effects. The vapors created by a bilious bottle dissipate after 1 minute, or automatically if exposed to anything more than a moderate wind. The vapors created by a bilious bottle are a poison effect.  d8 Result  1 The subject takes 1d6 points of acid damage.  2 The subject's eyes glow red for 2 hours, during which time it gains darkvision out to 30 feet.  3 The subject takes 1d6 points of fire damage.  4 The subject develops wheezing, labored breathing for 2 hours, which imposes a -2 penalty on Stealth checks.  5 The subject takes 1d6 points of cold damage.  6 The subject develops a persistent nosebleed, taking 1d4 points nonlethal damage every 10 minutes for the next hour.  7 The subject takes 1d6 points of electricity damage.  8 The subject experiences a persistent adrenaline rush.
