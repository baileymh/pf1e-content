      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This sturdy tool has a wooden haft topped with a curved pick head backed with a sharp adze blade at one end and capped with an iron spike on the other. When used as a climbing aid, an alpine ice axe grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks to scale rock or ice walls. In addition, an alpine ice axe negates any Climb DC modifiers for climbing a slippery surface. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can strike an area of ice or snow with the ice axe to instantly create a series of sturdy handholds in the ice covering a distance of up to 40 feet. An ice wall with these handholds has a Climb DC of 15.   An alpine ice axe is a tool, not a weapon, but it may be used as an improvised weapon with the usual -4 penalty on attack rolls made with it. An alpine ice axe wielded as a weapon functions either as a +1 light pick when striking with the pick spike or as a +1 hand axe when striking with the adze blade. The ice axe uses the standard threat range and critical modifier for those weapons. An alpine ice axe deals double damage against inanimate ice or snow, and if used as a weapon against a creature made mostly of ice (such as an ice elemental or ice golem), an alpine ice axe bypasses that creature's damage reduction.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, shatter, snow shapeHOG, creator must have 5 ranks in the Climb skill</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 70",
