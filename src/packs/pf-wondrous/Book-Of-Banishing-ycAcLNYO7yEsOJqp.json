      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This immense tome contains dozens of banishing rituals, each written in an ever-changing mix of languages. It can be read only by way of comprehend languages or a similar translating effect. As a full-round action, a mythic creature can flip to and read an appropriate ritual of banishment for a particular category of extraplanar creatures, such as angels or devils. Creatures not of that category are unaffected. The reader's caster level for this ritual is double her mythic tier.   Once the ritual is read, the book counts as an object that the chosen creatures hate and fear, granting a +2 bonus on the reader's caster level check to overcome the chosen creatures' spell resistance. If other objects and substances that can affect the caster level check to overcome spell resistance are available, the book's user can apply those objects and substances when using the banishment ritual, further increasing her bonus.   A book of banishing can be safely read once per day. If read additional times during that period (regardless of who reads it), the reader must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or suffer the effects of a feeblemind spell. This save DC increases by 5 each additional time the book is read that day.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, Mythic Creator, banishment, any one of cloak of chaos, holy aura, shield of law, or unholy aura</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Mythic Adventures",
