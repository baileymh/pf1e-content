A clandestine voucher is commonly used to transfer bribes or payment when exchanging material wealth would be illegal or draw too much attention. The voucher comes with a magical quill that, when touched to a coin, transforms the coin into ink of that color. Each coin fills the quill enough to make a single dot on the parchment. The quill can hold 200 coins worth of ink, but the ink is ruined if multiple types of coins are mixed. A single clandestine voucher can hold a number of dots equal to 1,600 coins. Each dot takes the same amount of space regardless of the coin's denomination.  To retrieve the coins from the clandestine voucher, the owner must apply a solvent to the paper, such as diluted alcohol or citrus juice. Coins that were magical or otherwise different from ordinary coins are restored as mundane coins. If the voucher is otherwise destroyed or significantly damaged, any coins stored in it are lost, though any dots that are intact can be restored normally.  The voucher can be reused, but this requires purchasing a new magical quill at a cost of 25 gp and washing any solvent out of the parchment before applying new ink. Cursed coins can't be transformed into ink and stored in the quill.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, treasure stitchingAPG</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Villain Codex",
