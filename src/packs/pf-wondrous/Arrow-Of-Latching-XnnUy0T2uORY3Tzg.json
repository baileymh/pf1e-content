      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The shaft of this unassuming arrow appears tightly wrapped in 6-1/4 feet of twine from arrowhead to fletching. In reality, the twine actually consists of 100 feet of hemp rope, reduced to one-sixteenth its size. An arrow of latching functions as a mundane arrow when fired at a creature, but when fired at a Medium or larger object, it embeds itself if the attack roll hits an AC of 5 + the hardness of the target object.  While the arrow is so lodged, anyone within 200 feet of it can speak the appropriate command word to unfurl and lower the arrow's hemp rope, causing the rope to return to its true size and extend downward 100 feet. If the character who says the command word has a free hand and is within 100 feet of the arrow of latching when he utters the command, the rope swings directly into his hand. A character attempting to hit an object with an arrow of latching can make a single ranged attack with the arrow and speak the command word to extend the rope after attacking with the arrow as a full-round action. Once the arrow is fixed, the rope can be used for any purpose a rope could serve and can bear up to 1,000 pounds at a time. If this weight limit is exceeded, the arrow of latching snaps, and any creature or object supported by the rope falls.  The arrow remains embedded within the target object indefinitely, although the user can pull it free from the target object by speaking a second command word or by succeeding at a DC 15 Strength check. If removed, the arrow of latching loses its magic, reduced to a common arrow.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, animate rope, handy grapnelUI, shrink item</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Villain Codex",
