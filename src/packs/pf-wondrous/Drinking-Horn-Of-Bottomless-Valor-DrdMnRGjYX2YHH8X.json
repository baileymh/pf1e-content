      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This horn is bound with fittings of gold and decorated with ornate carvings depicting scenes of glorious battle. A fully charged horn has 3 charges-charges used are automatically renewed each day. So long as the horn has at least one charge remaining, it's owner can command it to fill with mead or a similar alcoholic drink. A creature can spend one or more charges while drinking from the horn to gain the following benefits:  1 charge: The drinker gains 1d8 temporary hit points (as if from an aid spell), which last for 1 minute.  2 charges: The drinker gains 1d8+5 temporary hit points and is enlarged, as the spell enlarge person, for 5 minutes.  3 charges: The drinker gains 1d8+10 temporary hit points, is enlarged for 10 minutes, and gains the benefit of a heroism spell for as long as she is enlarged.  A creature must drink deeply from the horn to receive its full benefit. Using 1 charge is similar to drinking a potion-it takes a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity (though certain abilities can reduce the action required). To use 2 charges, the drinker must spend a full round drinking from the horn, which always provokes and attack of opportunity. To use all 3 charges, the drinker must spend 2 full-round actions drinking from the horn.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, aid, enlarge person, heroism</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Ultimate Equipment",
