      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>These rough leather gloves grant an enhancement bonus of +1 to +5 on attack and damage rolls with improvised weapons. Alternatively, the gloves can grant melee weapon special abilities, so long as they can be applied to melee or thrown weapons (see pages 136- 137 of Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment for a list of abilities). Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses. Gloves of improvised might cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +5. Unlike an amulet of mighty fists, gloves of improvised might must have a +1 enhancement bonus to grant a melee weapon special ability.  Normal weapons are unaffected by gloves of improvised might except when used as an improvised weapon in a way specifically permitted by the weapon description, such as using an arrow or bolt as a melee weapon (or if the user has an ability that allows the use of normal weapons as improvised weapons). The wearer still takes a -4 nonproficiency penalty on attack rolls with improvised weapons, as normal, unless he has the Catch Off-Guard feat or a similar ability.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, greater magic weapon, creator's caster level must be at least three times the gloves' bonus, plus any requirements of the melee weapon special abilities</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Adventurer's Armory 2",
