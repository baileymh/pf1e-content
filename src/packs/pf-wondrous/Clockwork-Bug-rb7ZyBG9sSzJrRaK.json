      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This Fine brass construct is made to look like a beetle, and is sometimes painted in green, brown, or gray camouflage. A clockwork bug can record all nearby sounds within a 20-foot-radius spread onto a low-quality gemstone worth 10 gp, which is embedded in its body. The bug can record up to 1 hour of sound, which must be continuous; if the recording is stopped early, it cannot be restarted. Making the clockwork bug replay the recorded audio is a swift action. Once a gemstone is imprinted with an audio recording, it cannot be reused, and must be replaced with a fresh gemstone in order for the bug to make a new recording. Replacing a gemstone is a full-round action that requires a DC 25 Disable Device check. Failing this check causes the used gemstone to become cracked and erases any recorded sounds on that gemstone. Though a clockwork bug isn't treated as a creature and cannot move or perform other actions by itself, it can cling indefinitely to any surface onto which it is placed, including the underside of objects. These bugs are also equipped with a timer that can delay the start of recording process by up to 24 hours. Additionally, the bug is equipped with an optional self-destruct timer with a maximum duration of 72 hours. If engaged, the self-destruct sequence causes the bug to erase any information on its current gemstone and then send a surge of energy through its filaments, rendering itself useless and irreparable.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, ghost sound, creator must have 4 ranks in Craft (clockwork)</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Magical Marketplace",
