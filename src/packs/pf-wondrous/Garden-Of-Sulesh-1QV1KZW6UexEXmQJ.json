      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This magic metal imprint is a genie seal, a special type of item that must be crafted onto a receptacle that holds a genie via the minimus containment effect of a binding spell. Binding usually has an ending trigger condition set by the binder, such as services the genie must perform before the spell can come to an end.  When applied to an appropriate receptacle that contains a bound genie, the Garden of Sulesh gives a measure of freedom to the bottled genie in exchange for a greater demand from the binder. The genie can freely leave and return to its bottle whenever the bottle is not physically sealed. The genie is unable to move its bottle on its own, and is prevented from moving more than 300 feet from the bottle by indestructible golden chains of force.  While crafting the seal onto a genie's receptacle, the crafter can edit the ending trigger conditions of the binding spell used to trap the genie. The new trigger condition must be a task that the genie could feasibly accomplish (though a bound genie's nigh-immortal lifespan can allow for far-reaching demands). Each year that the genie fails to complete this task, it must grant one wish to the binder if able. A genie under this seal is otherwise unable to grant wishes until its task is complete.  If the genie is restrained or prevented from working on its task, there is a cumulative 1% chance each round that the genie into a berserk state because it can't engage in its all-consuming task. A creature actively working against the genie's task increases this chance by an additional 1% every round it remains within the genie's sight. A berserk genie attacks any creature within 300 feet of its bottle. A genie that has no further targets for its fury exits its berserk state and returns to its task after 1 minute, resetting the berserk chance to 0%.  Only one genie seal can be crafted onto a container; if a second seal is crafted onto a genie's container, the genie is immediate freed from service. If a seal is destroyed or removed, a new one can be crafted onto the receptacle.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, binding, geas/quest, creator must have personally bound the genie contained within the receptacle upon which the seal is to be placed</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Lost Treasures",
