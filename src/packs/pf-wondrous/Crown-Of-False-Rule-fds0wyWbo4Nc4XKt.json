      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This item appears to be a crown studded with gems, but its valuable metals are only veneers and its gems are clever fakes. The wielder can alter the crown's appearance at will to that of any crown or circlet she has seen before, but only for as long as she wears the crown. In any form, the crown is detectable as a valueless fake with a successful DC 30 Appraise check. The wearer of a crown of false rule is considered the rightful political ruler of wherever she is for the purposes of magical spells or effects; for example, the wearer can receive the benefits of a magic throne (see below), draw a sword that can be removed only by a king, open a vault that unlocks at the duchess's touch, and so forth. This ability does not function in areas without a monarch or similar ruler (such as in a democracy), and it is not effective against discern location or the actions of deities or similarly powerful beings. For the purposes of detect spells (and spells with similar capabilities), crown of false rule does not appear to radiate a magical aura.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, magic aura, veil</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Heroes Of The High Court",
