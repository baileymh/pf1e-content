      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Each of these amulets is imbued with magic that allows it to protect its wearer against a very specific danger. A talisman triggers automatically as soon as the listed condition is fulfilled. Although talismans occupy the neck slot, up to three talismans can be worn on one cord or chain. Wearing multiple talismans in this way offers a greater variety of protection, but a wearer can benefit from only one talisman's effect at a time. If another talisman would be triggered while its wearer is under the effect of another talisman, that talisman is not triggered and can still be used later.  A lesser talisman carries only enough magical energy to protect its wearer once, after which it crumbles to dust.  Triskelion Talisman: This bronze talisman is carved in the shape of three interlocking spirals. When the wearer fails a saving throw against an effect that would cause him to become entangled, paralyzed, or slowed, he receives a second saving throw. If he succeeds at the second saving throw, the wearer instead gains the benefits of longstrider for 5 rounds.
