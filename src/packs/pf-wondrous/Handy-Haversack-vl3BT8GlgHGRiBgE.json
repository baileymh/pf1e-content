      "value": "<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a bag of holding and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds. While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.</p>\n<p><strong>Base Item:</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Requirements</strong></h3>\n<p>Craft Wondrous Item, secret chest</p>\n<h3><strong>Source: </strong></h3>\n<p>Ultimate Equipment</p>",
