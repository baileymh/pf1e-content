      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This tarnished canister appears to be a normal gas cylinder for releasing poisonous gases (see page 66), but it is actually a strange combination of arcane magic and modern technology designed to trap free-roaming vaporous creatures. A gas-trap cylinder can be armed as a standard action, and the device activates 1 round later. Once a gas-trap cylinder is activated, it remains so for 10 minutes, and any creature composed primarily of air, fog, mist, or other vapor (including air elementals, hungry fogs, mihstus, trench mists, vampiric mists, and creatures in gaseous form) within 30 feet of the cylinder must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be sucked into the device, becoming trapped within. Once trapped, a creature is held in stasis until released. A gas-trap cylinder can hold one Gargantuan or Huge creature, or up to two Large creatures, four Medium creatures, or eight Small or smaller creatures.   Releasing creatures trapped in a gas-trap cylinder follows the same process as arming the cylinder. Arming the device requires a standard action, and the trapped creatures are released 1 round later. A gas-trap cylinder can also be perforated (hardness 10, hp 30) to release those trapped within. All of the creatures trapped within the cylinder are released at one time. Freed creatures are not under the control of the device's user and are free to act as they wish-often violently.   A gas-trap cylinder can hold a creature or creatures indefinitely, but once the trapped creatures are released, the cylinder becomes nonmagical.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, binding</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 71",
