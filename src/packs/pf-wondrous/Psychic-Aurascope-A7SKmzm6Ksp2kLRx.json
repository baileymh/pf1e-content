      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>A magical version of a haunt detector (see page 12), a psychic aurascope is filled with a strange, swirling white vapor. A psychic aurascope acts in all ways as a haunt detector, but in addition, while the aurascope's bulb is touching a creature or object, the user can utter a command word to activate the aurascope, causing the vapor contained within it to rapidly shift between multiple hues for as long as it continues to touch that creature or object. The hues displayed within the aurascope relate to the touched creature or object's alignment aura, emotion aura, health aura, and magic aura, allowing the user to use the read aura occult skill unlock (Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures 197) once per day, even if she has no levels in an occult class or doesn't have the Psychic Sensitivity feat. If the user has levels in an occult class or the Psychic Sensitivity feat, she can attempt a Perception check with a DC equal to 25 + the creature's Hit Dice or the item's caster level and apply the result to all of the target's auras instead of just one single aura. The user can use this version of the read aura occult skill unlock at will; it doesn't count as her one daily use of the read aura skill unlock.  In addition, if the user attempts to read the auras of an object that is associated with a haunt, the object's auras twist and writhe in the shape of skulls, anguished faces, and flashes of scenes relating to the haunt's formation, allowing her to use Knowledge (religion) to attempt to identify the haunt's elements, such as its area, notice DC, weakness, trigger, destruction requirements, and so on. The DC to identify a haunt's elements with a psychic aurascope is equal to 20 + the haunt's CR, which allows the user to determine one of the haunt's elements, chosen randomly. For every 5 by which the check's result exceeds this DC, the user randomly determines another one of the haunt's elements.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, analyze auraOA, speak with hauntACG</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Haunted Heroes Handbook",
