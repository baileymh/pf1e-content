      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This silver locket is suspended from a silver chain. As a standard action, a creature holding the locket can speak a command word to attempt to steal the sight of one creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude saving throw or its eyes are immediately sealed within the locket's interior and replaced with featureless, shadowy orbs, causing the creature to be permanently blinded. The wielder can speak a second command word to return the victim's eyes; otherwise, this blindness cannot be removed except by miracle or wish.  Each eye-stealing locket can contain only a single set of eyes at a time, and the creature in possession of the locket is treated as having a body part of the creature to whom the eyes belong for the purpose of spells such as scrying. If the wielder is a mesmerist and he uses an eye-stealing locket against the target of his hypnotic stare, he can apply the Will saving throw penalty from his hypnotic stare to the Fortitude saving throw the target attempts to prevent its eyes being stolen.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, blindness/deafness</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Blood Of Shadows",
