      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The cloak of moral refraction has long been a tool of the riftwardens-mystics who charge themselves with maintaining cosmic balance and closing extraplanar portals throughout the multiverse. The shimmering fabric of this light silver-and-red cloak never dirties or wrinkles, and when laid out flat, the cloak reflects light nearly as well as a mirror.  A fully charged cloak of moral refraction has 3 charges-charges used are automatically renewed at a rate of 1 charge per day at dawn. The wearer may use the cloak to expend these charges and create the following effects.  • 1 charge: Dispel an ongoing spell with an alignment descriptor, as the third function of dispel chaos/evil/good/law.  • 2 charges: Ready an action to counter a spell or spell-like ability with an alignment descriptor. The effect is automatically countered, and no caster level check is required. The charges are expended only after countering a spell or spell-like ability. If you ready this action but it is not triggered, the charges are not expended.  • 3 charges: As an immediate action, counter a spell or spell-like ability cast by an outsider with an alignment subtype. The effect is automatically countered, and no caster level check is required. In addition, the outsider must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be banished back to its home plane,  as banishment. An outsider with more than 26 Hit Dice is unaffected by the banishment effect.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item; banishment; dispel chaos, evil, good, and law; dispel magic; creator must be neutral</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Champions Of Balance",
