      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>A rod of wonder is a strange and unpredictable device that randomly generates any number of weird effects each time it is used.

These last 24 hours.  88-90 10-40 gems, value 1 gp each, shoot forth in a 30-foot-long stream. Each gem deals 1 point of damage to any creature in its path: roll 5d4 for the number of hits and divide them among the available targets.  91-95 Shimmering colors dance and play over a 40-foot-by-30-foot area in front of rod. Creatures therein are blinded for 1d6 rounds (Fortitude DC 15 negates).  96-97 Wielder (50% chance) or the target (50% chance) turns permanently blue, green, or purple (no save).  98-100 Flesh to stone (or stone to flesh if the target is stone already) if the target is within 60 feet (Fortitude DC 18 negates).<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Rod, confusion, creator must be chaotic</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Ultimate Equipment",
