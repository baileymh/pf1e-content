      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This squat and elongated silver teapot is engraved with images of clouds, stars and the setting sun. Glass windows on its side allow one to see its contents, and it can be filled via the lid on top. The teapot can be used normally with no ill effects, although it holds very little liquid.  If the teapot is filled with water and crushed gems however, any who drink from the teapot have their soul drawn into the pot, provided they consumed at least 1,000 gp worth of gem-dust for each HD they possess. The victim can make a DC 22 Will save to negate this effect. If the drinker's name is spoken as they drink, the DC increases by +2 and any spell resistance is ignored.  If the victim has their soul drawn into the Lover's Lament, they fall into a deathlike state although their body does not rot or decay and appears to be at rest. The liquid inside the lamp now functions as the gem from a successful soul bind spell, with the following differences: The soul can be restored to its owner by simply 'pouring' the soul back through the corpse's lips. The magic holding the soul inside the pot is intentionally weak, and destroying the pot or placing it in an antimagic field will also restore the soul to its original body, providing the body has not been damaged or removed from the plane. If there is no body for the soul to return to, it begins its journey to the afterlife.  The Lover's Lament was originally made for and used by an old aristocratic family who've long since been forgotten. When one of the family went to war, their significant other would trap their own soul in the Lament until their love returned, so they would be spared the pain of their parting. While awaiting their return, the magic of the Lament would cause them to dream of angels.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, gentle repose, prestidigitation, soul bind, trap the soul</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Rappan Athuk-New Encounters",
