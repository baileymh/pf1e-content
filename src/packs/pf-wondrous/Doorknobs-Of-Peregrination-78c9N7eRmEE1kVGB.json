      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>These matching doorknobs or handles with latches are made of solid brass and are inscribed with unusual spiraling patterns that appear to be merely decorative.  To use the doorknobs of peregrination, a user affixes the pair of them upon two entirely separate, unconnected portals. When one of the doors is opened by means of one such doorknob, it causes the other door to open as well, and the user and anyone with him can step through the opening as if the two doors were one. The doorknobs have a range of 400 feet; if the two doors are farther apart, the doorknobs of peregrination don't function, and if the door on either side is locked, stuck, or otherwise secured, the doorknob fails to open the first door (even if the second door is the one that is locked).  Doorknobs of peregrination can be removed and placed on a variety of doors as often as desired (placing a doorknob is a  standard action, as is removing one). They can be placed upon different types of doors, as long as the surface of each door is solid rather than open-air. Thus, the knob can't function on a gate or portcullis, but it works on an otherwise solid door with a small, sliding window (such as a prison door) as long as the window is closed at the time of use. A knob can be placed upon a door and activated to connect with its twin, and the user can remove the first knob while the door is open as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity in order to bring it with him when he steps through. If he does so, the magic of the portal lasts for 1 additional round and then fades.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, dimension door</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Villain Codex",
