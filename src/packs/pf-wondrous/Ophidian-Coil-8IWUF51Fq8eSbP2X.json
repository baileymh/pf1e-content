      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This small wooden ring resembles a serpent with tiny gemstone eyes coiling around the wearer's finger. If worn for 24 hours, it causes its wearer to manifest many serpentine traits. The wearer's skin develops a faint, diamond-shaped pattern, and the pupils of her eyes elongate. The wearer grows a pair of fangs, gaining a bite attack as a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of piercing damage for a Medium wearer or 1d3 points of damage for a Small wearer.  Three times per day as a free action, the wearer of the  ring may cause her fangs to drip with venom, making her bite attack poisonous for 1 round. The save DC of this poison is equal to 10 + 1/2 the wearer's Hit Dice + the wearer's Constitution modifier, but otherwise acts as black adder venom. If the wearer rolls a natural 1 on an attack with her poisonous bite, she is exposed to the poison.  Once per day as a standard action, the wearer may command her tongue to lengthen and become forked for 1 minute, gaining the scent special ability. While this ability is active, the wearer has a 20% chance of failure when casting any spell with a verbal component, as the tongue makes it difficult to speak.  The ring makes its wearer more sensitive to cold. She takes a -2 penalty to saves against spells with the cold descriptor and the effects of cold weather. Additionally, if the wearer is successfully affected by a spell with the cold descriptor, she is slowed for 1 round.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Forge Ring, beast shape I, poison</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Down The Blighted Path",
