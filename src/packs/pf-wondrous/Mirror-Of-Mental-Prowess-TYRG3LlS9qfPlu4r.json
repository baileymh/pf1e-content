      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This mirror resembles an ordinary looking glass 5 ft. tall by 2 ft. wide. The possessor who knows the proper commands can cause it to perform as follows.  Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the owner is within 25 ft. of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in an unknown language.  View other places as if with clairvoyance, but vision extends even onto other planes if the viewer is sufficiently familiar with them.  Use it as a portal to visit other places. The user first views the place with the clairvoyance function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured.  Others can follow her through the mirror if they like.  An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Any creature who steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror.  Once per week the mirror accurately answers one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown on its surface (giving answers similar to those from the legend lore spell).<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, detect thoughts, clairaudience/  clairvoyance, gate, legend lore</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Rappan Athuk",
