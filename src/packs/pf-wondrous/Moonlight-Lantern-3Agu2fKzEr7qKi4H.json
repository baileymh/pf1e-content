      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This intricate silver bullseye lantern filters its light through a stained-glass image of a howling wolf silhouetted by the moon. The pale blue light it casts does little to illuminate the surrounding area, casting dim light in a 60-foot cone directed by the lantern's bearer. The lantern can remain lit for 30 minutes per day. These minutes don't need to be used consecutively, but must be spent in 5-minute increments.  When the lantern's light falls on a creature that is not in its true form or that has more than one form-such as a creature that has been polymorphed, a doppelganger, or a lycanthrope-the light shows all of that creature's forms. Anyone who can see the target perceives any additional forms as semi-transparent illusions superimposed over the creature's current form. This is a divination effect and otherwise works as per true seeing.  Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can force a creature within the lantern's light to assume another of its forms. If the creature is under the effects of a spell with the polymorph descriptor, the bearer can attempt to dispel the effect (as per dispel magic) using the lantern's caster level. If the creature has the shapechanger subtype, it must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save to resist this effect. If it fails this saving throw, the bearer of the moonlight lantern can choose another of the target's forms and force it to transform immediately. The shapechanger doesn't need to spend an action to do so. The target must remain in the chosen form for at least 1 minute before it can shift again.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, dispel magic, greater polymorph, true seeing</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Horror Adventures",
