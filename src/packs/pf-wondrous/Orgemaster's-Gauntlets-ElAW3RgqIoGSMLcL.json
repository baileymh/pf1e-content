      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>These scorched gauntlets of heavy padded leather are reinforced with metallic mesh and ceramic pads to diffuse heat. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on Craft (armor) and Craft (weapons) checks.  8th Level: The wearer can use spark at will.  10th Level: The wearer gains fire resistance 5, and her hands are immune to fire damage, so she can pick up hot objects or touch flames without being harmed. Weapons affected by heat metal or similar effects deal no damage to the wearer, and the wearer likewise ignores damage from effects like fire shield (hot flames version) that deal fire damage to a creature attacking in melee.  11th Level: The forgemaster's gauntlets are +1 gauntlets.  12th Level: The wearer of the forgemaster's gauntlets can heat objects she touches. She can use heat metal (DC 13) at will. If she's targeting a metal object worn by a foe, she must succeed at a melee touch attack. If the targeted item is being held or wielded, the wearer of the forgemaster's gauntlets must attempt a combat maneuver check as if she were attempting to sunder the item. This maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the wearer does not have the Improved Sunder feat.  13th Level: The wearer's fire resistance increases to 10.  14th Level: The forgemaster's gauntlets are +1 flaming gauntlets.  15th Level: The forgemaster's gauntlets are +1 flaming burst gauntlets.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item; flame blade, flame strike, or fireball; heat metal; resist energy; sparkAPG; creator must have 5 ranks in Craft (armor) and Craft (weapons)</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
