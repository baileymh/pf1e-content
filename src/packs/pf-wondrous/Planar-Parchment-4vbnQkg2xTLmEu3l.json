      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Resembling ordinary paper, planar parchment is used when negotiating with outsiders via spells like planar ally or planar binding. Using the parchment as part of negotiations grants the user a +2 bonus on her Charisma check to coerce the called outsider if such a check is required.  Planar parchment offers some autonomy to outsiders called for longer missions via planar ally. The use of planar parchment increases the time for a planar ally from 1 day per caster level to 1 week per caster level for long-term tasks (without increasing the cost of the payment the outsider requires). An outsider that has its term of service increased in this way isn't bound to the plane to which it was called. After negotiations are complete, it can return to its home plane, but is still required to perform the services it agreed to complete.  Regardless of whether the outsider was called via planar ally or planar binding magic, the outsider maintains a connection with the planar parchment for the duration of its service. Any writings added to the parchment are instantly transmitted to the bound outsider, as a sending spell (with no chance of failure if the outsider is on another plane). These words disappear from the parchment 1 hour after being inscribed.  Finally, once an outsider is bound to service with a planar parchment, the parchment is inscribed with script visible only to the creature completing the negotiation, or via true seeing. Reading this script is a full-round action, akin to reading a scroll. Reading this aloud immediately summons the bound outsider to the location of the scroll.  A planar parchment can be used for only one negotiation, and then turns into a nonmagical piece of parchment.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, planar binding, sending</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Ultimate Intrigue",
