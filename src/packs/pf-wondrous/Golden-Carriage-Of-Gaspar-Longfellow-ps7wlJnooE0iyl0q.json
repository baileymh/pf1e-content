      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Crafted from the finest materials, the Golden Carriage of Gaspar Longfellow is a vehicle fit for royalty. Larger than an average carriage, the Golden Carriage can accommodate six occupants in the interior, as well as two drivers and a footman on the exterior. The interior is lavishly furnished and magically maintained-occupants are protected from extreme heat and cold as if under the effects of endure elements, and are treated as acclimated creatures for altitudes up to 15,000 feet (see altitude zones, Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 430). Both doors of the carriage are secured against intruders with alarm and arcane lock spells, and an invisible driver can control the reins as unseen servant if no living driver is controlling the carriage.  The most prominent features of the Golden Carriage are the four spectral steeds that pull it. Adorned in beautiful scarlet leather harnesses, these gray horses pull the carriage tirelessly over nearly any terrain. These horses function as phantom steed cast by a 12th-level caster, and grant their air walk, water walk, and other abilities to the carriage.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, phantom steed, secure shelter</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Lost Treasures",
