      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Short lengths of twine dangle sharp metal needles from each end of this cross-shaped wooden bar. To use a marionette crux, the wielder points the item at any humanoid within 25 feet and makes a ranged touch attack as a standard action as the strings suddenly extend out. If the attack hits, the needles pierce the victim's wrists and ankles, causing the victim to become sickened for 1 round by the momentary flash of pain.  In addition, the victim must make a DC 17 Will save to avoid being dominated by the crux, as if via dominate person.  The needles immediately retract back to the crux an instant after they strike a foe, but if the victim has been dominated, the crux's wielder can control its actions. Control lies with the crux, not the person who made the initial attack-passing the crux to another creature allows that creature to take control of the dominated humanoid. If the crux is given to the victim, the effect ends. The crux must be held in the user's hand in order for the user to issue a new command to the victim. Otherwise, the domination effect caused by a marionette crux lasts for a day, but additional uses of the crux can effectively extend the effect over a victim indefinitely. A marionette crux can maintain domination over only one creature at a time-if a second humanoid is dominated by the crux, the previously dominated human is released from the effect immediately.  A marionette crux can be activated up to two times per day.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, dominate person</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Rival Guide",
