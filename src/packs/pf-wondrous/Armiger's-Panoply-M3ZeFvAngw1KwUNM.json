      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>An armiger's panoply is a magic item set made up of one pair of bracers and a large leather sack. The bracers are normally forearm guards made in the style of masterwork padded or quilted cloth armor. They are often made of silk or high-quality linen, though they can also be crafted of leather or even chain links. A command word is normally inscribed on the inside of one of the bracers. The sack can be used to store a single suit of armor, including a shield. The armor retains its normal weight when stored. If items other than a suit of armor and a shield are put in the sack, they immediately fall through.  Three times per day, the wearer of the bracers can speak the panoply's command word to have the suit of armor and shield stored in the sack teleport onto the wearer. The sack must be within 500 feet of the wearer of the bracers in order to function. If the wearer is already in a suit of armor, it is teleported into the sack at the same time the new armor is teleported onto the user's body. As long as the armor to be worn is the same size as the user, it fits perfectly and doesn't interfere with anything else worn or hindering the user, including any grapple or tight space the wearer might be trapped in.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, effortless armorUC</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Knights Of The Inner Sea",
