      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This garment is lined with gilded leaves, magically preserved in their autumnal splendor. The leaves retain this natural appearance in urban areas or natural settings other than forests or wooded areas. When the wearer is in a forest environment, the vest's leaves change to match the local flora. As long as the wearer moves no more than half her base speed in a given round,  she gains a +4 bonus on Stealth checks and can attempt Stealth checks without cover or concealment. Each time the wearer attacks, the leaves turn blood red, negating this effect for 1 minute.  8th Level: Once per day, the wearer can detach one of the leaves of the garment and send it floating toward a location she specifies, borne on the wind but otherwise identical in effect to an animal messenger.  11th Level: Once per day, the wearer can either assume tree shape or transform herself into a cloud of leaves floating, falling, and swirling about in a mass the same size as the wearer's actual body. This leaf form is equivalent to gaseous form, but the wearer also gains vulnerability to fire.  13th Level: The wearer can, in place of using either of the vest's 11th-level abilities, choose to release a number of leaves equal to 1/2 her Hit Dice as remote magical sensors. These leaves are identical in effect to prying eyes, except that they have vulnerability to fire.  16th Level: The leaves warp and distort the wearer's location as blur, providing a 20% miss chance.  20th Level: The wearer can step into any tree that possesses leaves and out of another tree of the same kind that also possesses leaves, as tree stride. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Hit Dice.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, arcane eye, blendARG, blur, command plants, prying eyes, tree shape, tree stride</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
