      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>These coarse, heavy boots are fitted with numerous iron plates and rusted spikes that give them an intimidating appearance. The wearer can use brutish boots to attack as if using a masterwork cold iron gauntlet or masterwork cold iron spiked gauntlet, depending on which portion of the boot he uses.  These boots also protect the wearer's feet as if they had hardness 8. This hardness applies only against effects that directly affect the target's feet, such as caltrops, spike growth, spike stones, or stepping into a puddle of acid. It also applies against effects that deal damage to an attacker, such as fire shield, thorn body, or the barbed defense of a barbed devil, but only if the wearer is using the brutish boots to make the attack.  10th Level: If the wearer confirms a critical hit on an attack using the boots, he can attempt a combat maneuver check to trip the target. This maneuver doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.  12th Level: Attack and damage rolls made with the boots gain a +1 enhancement bonus.  14th Level: If a creature within the wearer's reach is knocked prone, that creature provokes an attack of opportunity from the wearer. This attack of opportunity must be made with the brutish boots.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, telekinesis</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Pathfinder Unchained",
