      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>These boots are well worn and caked with mud, but still sturdy, comfortable, and dry on the inside.  Three times per day, the wearer can activate the boots to cause up to 9 5-foot squares of nearby terrain to become a shallow bog. All affected squares are instantly filled with 1 foot of water, mud, and plant life. The wearer can move through these squares at her normal speed, but other creatures treat the squares as a shallow bog (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 427), costing 2 squares of movement to move into each affected square.  The initial affected square must be adjacent to the wearer. Each additional affected square must be adjacent to another affected square, but otherwise the effect can take any shape the wearer desires.   As a standard action, the wearer can rearrange the affected squares. Multiple uses of the boots can create larger areas of bog. The effect lasts until dismissed by the wearer (a free action), the wearer moves more than 5 feet beyond the affected area, the wearer becomes unconscious, or the boots are removed.  Additionally, once per day, the wearer can travel as per dimension door from one affected square to another.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, dimension door, transmute rock to mud</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Daughters Of Fury",
