      "value": "<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This calfskin drum is painted with an image of a grinning skull, and comes with a giant's finger bones to use as beaters. A creature with at least 1 rank in Perform (percussion) can play a steady rhythm on the drum as a standard action each round. Doing so grants all undead creatures within 30 feet of the drummer a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and Will saves each round the drum is played.  Alternatively, the drummer can instead force undead creatures in the area to dance in place to the beat of the drum. Affected undead within 30 feet can't leave their spaces and take a -2 penalty to Armor Class and on Reflex saves for as long as the drummer plays. Intelligent undead can attempt a DC 12 Will save to resist this effect; those that succeed can move and take actions normally, but still take the -2 penalty on Reflex saves and must succeed at concentration checks to cast spells (DC = 10 + the spell's level). Mindless undead receive no save and can take no actions other than dancing.  A bonedancer bodhran can be used for 9 rounds per day; these rounds need not be consecutive.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p>Craft Wondrous Item, command undead, creator must have the bardic performance class ability</p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Daughters Of Fury",
