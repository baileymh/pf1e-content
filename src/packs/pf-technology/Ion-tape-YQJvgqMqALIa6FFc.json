A roll of ion tape fits in the palm of a hand and comes in a wide range of colors. A single roll contains 50 feet of tape. A single strip of tape is easy to cut through or tear. When wrapped around an object, it has a weak adhesive that keeps it in place. When ion tape is exposed to an electrical charge of any power (including a jolt from a zip stick), the tape bonds together into a single mass of plastic-like material, gaining hardness 8 and 30 hit points. When used to bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful DC 28 Strength check to break. A second jolt from an electrical source causes the tape to revert to its weaker ribbon condition, at which point it can be torn free easily. A strip of ion tape can hold about 5 pounds of weight normally, but when activated via a jolt, a single hardened strip can support up to 300 pounds of weight. The uses for ion tape are many-it can be used to construct basic objects (such as a ladder), patch holes, bind prisoners, and so on.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft</strong> DC 14; <strong>Cost</strong> 50 gp</p><p>Craft Technological Item, production lab</p>",
