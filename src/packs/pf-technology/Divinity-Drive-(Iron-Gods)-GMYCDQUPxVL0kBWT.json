      "value": "<p><strong>Artifact</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Pathfinder #90: The Divinity Drive pg. 60</em></p>\n<p><strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> 2,500 lbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Capacity</strong> infinite; <strong>Usage</strong> see text</p>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Description</h3>\n<p>The apex of Androffan technology, the Divinity Drive was the single most important piece of machinery on <em>Divinity</em>-important enough to inspire the ship's name. The drive was named for its unbelievable power-the closest to godlike energy that the people of Androffa had ever experienced. The Divinity Drive appears as nothing more than a 5-foot-diameter sphere of blue light, yet the mass generated by this sphere is significant. Enhancements made to the drive over the past several thousand years by Unity have reduced its mass significantly. It is contained within a series of circular arms of tempered adamantine-difficult to damage to begin with, but while the drive is infused with Unity's divine power, the entire structure is essentially indestructible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Divinity Drive's primary purpose was to create wormholes in space that would allow for swift travel over vast distances. Programming the Divinity Drive to open a wormhole can be accomplished only outside of significant gravitational fields-in high orbit around a planet or further out in space. A successful DC 25 Knowledge (engineering) check is required to program the wormhole's destination, a process which takes 2d6 days to complete. Every 5 points by which the check exceeds this DC reduces the number of days required by 1 (minimum 1). A wormhole can be torn open as an act of desperation in only 2d6 minutes with the same Knowledge (engineering) DC, but doing so causes the wormhole to open to a random point elsewhere in the Material Plane, and it damages the drive's wormhole function-which requires a large team of engineers or a dedicated AI to repair, and takes several years to complete.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When created, the wormhole connects two points on the Material Plane, as if by <em>gate</em>. The wormhole measures 1 mile in diameter, and remains open for 24 hours (or until the Divinity Drive moves more than 100 miles away from the wormhole). It can be closed manually before this time expires with a successful DC 40 Knowledge (engineering) check. Any object not yet clear of the wormhole when it closes is cut into two parts separated by a vast distance (which generally results in death or destruction), though a creature can avoid this by succeeding at a DC 20 Reflex save to throw itself into one side or the other before the wormhole closes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In time, Unity found another use for the Divinity Drive-the transformation of a virtual reality into a stable divine realm housed entirely within the code of Divinity's computer system. Today, the Divinity Drive functions as the linchpin for Unity's realm; as long as Unity exists, its realm and the Divinity Drive shall persist in this invulnerable state.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Divinity Drive has other astonishing effects as well as long as it functions, as summarized below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All teleportation and extradimensional travel within Silver Mount (or within a 1-mile radius if the Divinity Drive is removed from Silver Mount) is suppressed, as if by a <em>dimensional lock</em> effect. A few teleportation effects (such as the teleporter between areas <strong>A15</strong> and <strong>G6</strong>, and travel to and from the Godmind in area <strong>G5</strong>) are exempt from this. A successful DC 30 Knowledge (engineering) check allows someone who examines the Divinity Drive for 1d6 minutes to deactivate this effect, allowing teleportation to function normally, but the drive cannot be used to open wormholes while this effect is inactive.</li>\n<li>The Divinity Drive is a staggering source of power, and functions as a generator with infinite yield.</li>\n<li>The area in a 50-foot-radius spread around the Divinity Drive is maintained at a constant temperature of extreme cold, and it actively leeches sources of heat from unshielded or unprotected sources. Living creatures in this area take 1d6 points of cold damage per round, and casting a spell with the fire descriptor requires a successful DC 25 caster level check to avoid having the spell automatically countered as its cast. Technological items that generate fire effects function normally in this area, but all existing fires are extinguished at the end of the round. Creatures with the fire subtype take 6d6 points of cold damage per round in this region (Fortitude DC 25 negates for that round).</li>\n<li>The Divinity Drive emits a constant, thunderous hum that imposes a ï¿½10 penalty on all Perception checks made within a 50-foot-radius spread.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"framing\">Destruction</h3>\n<p>If Unity is destroyed, the aura that protects the Divinity Drive fails. It can then be destroyed as a normal item (hardness 20, hp 1,200), which causes it to explode as if a graviton reactor<sup>TG</sup>, but with twice as much damage and double the radius.</p>",
