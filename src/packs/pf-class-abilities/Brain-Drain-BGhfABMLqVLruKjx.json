      "value": "<strong>Shaman Spirit Hex</strong><br/><br/><p>As a standard action, the shaman violently probes the mind of a single intelligent enemy within 30 feet. The target can attempt a Will saving throw to negate the effect. If it succeeds, it immediately knows the source of the mental prying; otherwise, it's wracked with pain and takes 1d4 points of damage for every 2 levels the shaman possesses. On the round following her successful use of this ability, the shaman can take a fullround action to sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and memories to attempt a single Knowledge check using the victim's bonus with that skill. The random stolen thoughts remain in the shaman's mind for a number of rounds equal to her Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and she can treat the knowledge gained as if she used detect thoughts. This is a mind-affecting effect. Once she successfully affects a creature, she cannot use this hex on that creature again for 24 hours.</p>",
