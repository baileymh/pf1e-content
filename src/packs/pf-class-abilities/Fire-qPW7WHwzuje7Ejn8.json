      "value": "<strong>Shifter Elemental Aspect</strong><br/><br/><p>You take on the power of a fire elemental, becoming a being of living flame that can burn enemies and move with great speed. You enjoy regions where precipitation rarely intrudes, such as desert landscapes and dry savannas, but the slopes of volcanoes hold the greatest majesty to you. You enjoy the companionship of swiftly moving creatures and those who enjoy basking in the sun, for you empathize with their appreciation of the daytime's warmth. Forest fires are things of beauty to you, yet you respect fire and would never think to wantonly inflict it upon the natural world. Summer is your favorite season, for this is a time of heat waves and blistering sunny days.</p><p><b>Minor Form: </b>You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your Dexterity score. This bonus increases to +4 at 8th level and to +6 at 15th level.</p><p><b>Major Form: </b>Your shape changes to that of a Medium fire elemental (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 124). While you are in this form, your base speed changes to 50 feet and you gain immunity to fire, vulnerability to cold, and the burn special attack as per the universal monster rule, dealing damage equal to your slam attack whenever a creature fails its Reflex save against that ability. At 8th level, you gain Improved Natural Attack with your slam. At 15th level, you deal fire damage equal to double your slam damage against opponents that fail their saves against your burn ability.</p>",
