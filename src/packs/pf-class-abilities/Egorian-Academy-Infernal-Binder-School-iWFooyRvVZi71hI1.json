      "value": "<strong>Wizard Arcane School</strong><br/><br/><p>The prestigious Egorian Academy of the Magical Arts in Cheliax's capital city teaches a full spectrum of magic, both specialized and universalist, but the college is best known for its Infernal Binding program in the school of conjuration. An infernal binder learns the Names of Hell, and can use those powers to summon and bind devils to do her bidding. If she makes a single mistake in the binding, she opens herself to an eternity of torment. Egorian Academy wizards are recognized across Avistan as premier practitioners of the arcane arts. Many hold high positions in magical colleges across Golarion, but most seek to return one day to teach at their alma mater in Egorian.</p><p><b>Suggested Opposition Schools: </b>Divination, illusion, or transmutation.</p><p><b>Alignment: </b>Lawful Evil, Lawful Neutral, Neutral Evil, or Neutral.</p><p><b>Requirements: </b>An infernal binder must choose a familiar as her arcane bond at 1st level.</p><p><b>Associated School: </b>Conjuration.</p><p><b>Replacement Powers: </b>The following school powers replace the acid dart and dimensional steps powers of the conjuration school.</p>",
