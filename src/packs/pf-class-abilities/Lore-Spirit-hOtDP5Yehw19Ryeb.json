      "value": "<strong>Shaman Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>A shaman who selects the lore spirit appears far wiser and knowing that her age would suggest. Though she can seem unassuming, her eyes give the impression she is peering deep into all she looks at, seeing the secrets of the essential merely by concentrating.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells: </b>identify (1st), tongues (2nd), locate object (3rd), legend lore (4th), contact other plane (5th), mass owl's wisdom (6th), vision (7th), moment of prescience (8th), time stop (9th)</p><p><b>Hexes: </b>A shaman who chooses the Lore spirit can select from the following hexes.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal: </b>The shaman's spirit animal appears to be quiet and unassuming. It gains a +2 bonus on Initiative checks and a +4 bonus on Stealth checks.</p><p><b>Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Lore spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p><p><i>Monstrous Insight (Su): </i>The shaman can identify creatures and gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses. As a standard action, the shaman can attempt a Knowledge skill check to identify a creature and its abilities (using the appropriate skill for the monster's type) with an insight bonus equal to her shaman level. Whether or not the check is successful, she also gains a +2 insight bonus for 1 minute on attack rolls made against that creature and a +2 insight bonus to her AC against attacks made by that creature. These bonuses last for 1 minute. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.</p><p><b>Greater Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Lore spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Automatic Writing (Su): </i>Once per day, the shaman can spend 10 minutes in uninterrupted meditation to tap into greater understanding. During this period, her hands produce mysterious writings pertaining to the future. This writing takes the form of divination with 90% effectiveness. The shaman can use this ability an additional time per day at 12th, 16th, and 20th levels.</p><p><b>True Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Lore spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Perfect Knowledge (Ex): </i>The shaman gains the benefit of the tongues spell permanently.

She can take 20 on all Knowledge skill checks, including those she isn't trained in. Her understanding of the fundamental underpinnings of reality has also become so advanced that she can cast wish once per day. This doesn't require a material component, but the wish cannot be used to grant ability score bonuses or replicate spells with expensive material components.</p>",
