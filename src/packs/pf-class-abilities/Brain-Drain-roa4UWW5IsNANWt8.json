      "value": "<strong>Shaman Spirit Hex</strong><br/><br/><p>As a standard action, the shaman can violently probe the mind of a single intelligent creature within 60 feet. The target can attempt a Will save to negate the effect and immediately know the source of this harmful mental prying. Creatures that fail their saving throws are racked with pain, taking 1d6 points of damage for every 2 shaman levels the shaman has. After successfully damaging a creature with this ability, the shaman can sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and memories as a fullround action and then attempt a single Knowledge check using the victim's skill bonus rather than her own. If the victim wasn't trained in the Knowledge skill the shaman wishes to use, then this check must be attempted as if untrained as well. The randomly stolen thoughts remain in the shaman's mind for a number of rounds equal to her Wisdom modifier, and the shaman can attempt one Knowledge check per round using these drained thoughts. This ability does not give access to memories or other personal information known by the victim. Brain drain is a mind-affecting effect.</p><p>The shaman can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels beyond 5th, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.</p>",
