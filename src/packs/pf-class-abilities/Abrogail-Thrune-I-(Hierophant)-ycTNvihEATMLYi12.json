Once there, you must vow to never break a binding contract, and must make a case for why you should be entrusted with power over others. Doing so requires a Wisdom check; if you succeed, Thrune answers your call.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Thrune, you must vow to fight against chaos wherever you see it.</p><p><b>Dynamic Decree (Lesser, Su): </b>Thrune always grants the following spells of each level: 0-bleed, 1st-bane, 2nd-enthrall, 3rd-agonize (Ultimate Magic 205), 4th-greater infernal healing (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 295), 5th-true seeing, 6th-banishment. This ability alters divine surge.</p><p><b>Supernatural Aid (Greater, Su): </b>Once per day, you can call an outsider with a number of Hit Dice equal to or less than yours (maximum 18 HD) as if casting the appropriate planar ally spell. You do not need to pay the material component required to cast the spell, but you still must bargain with and pay the outsider for its services. This ability replaces overflowing grace.</p>",
