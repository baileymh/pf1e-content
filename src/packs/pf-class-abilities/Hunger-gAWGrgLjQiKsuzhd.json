      "value": "<strong>Oracle Curse</strong><br/><br/><p>Ravenous hunger wracks your body in stressful situations. You gain none of the benefits from spells or magic items that provide nourishment, such as goodberry, heroes' feast, or a ring of sustenance. You also gain a bite attack that deals an amount of piercing damage appropriate for your size (1d8 for a Large creature, 1d6 for Medium, 1d4 for Small) as a secondary natural attack. You begin each combat with the sickened condition until you deal damage with your bite attack. At 5th level, you gain the grab monster special ability on bite attacks against creatures smaller than yourself. At 10th level, your bite attack deals damage as if you were one size category larger. At 15th level, you gain the blood drain monster special ability with your bite, dealing 1d2 points of Constitution damage at the end of a turn if you grapple a foe.</p>",
