      "value": "<strong>Medium Base Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>A guardian spirit is an exemplar of protection and defense.</p><p><b>Spirit Bonus: </b>When you channel a guardian, your spirit bonus applies to AC and on Constitution checks, Fortitude saves, and Reflex saves.</p><p><b>Seance Boon: </b>You gain a +1 bonus to CMD.</p><p><b>Favored Locations: </b>City walls, forts, gates, keeps.</p><p><b>Influence Penalty: </b>You are incredibly cautious and guarded in all things, and your caution sometimes gets in the way. When attacking, you always fight defensively, and when casting a spell, you always cast defensively. Because of your focus on defense, you take a penalty on damage rolls equal to your spirit bonus.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>Choose one: you must always protect others from danger when you can (including defeated enemies, but not enemies that are an active threat to you and others); you must keep your body in fit physical condition, and you break this taboo every time you drop below half your maximum hit points; you must speak no words and use no abilities with the sonic descriptor, and you break this taboo if you become enraged, frightened, or panicked.</p><p><b>Guardian's Shield (Lesser, Su): </b>You gain proficiency in heavy armors and shields (including tower shields).</p><p><b>Absorb Blow (Intermediate, Su): </b>You gain DR/- and resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic equal to 1/2 your medium level. Add paladin's sacrificeAPG to your medium spells known as a 2nd-level spell.</p><p><b>Sudden Block (Greater, Su): </b>After an enemy's attack would hit you or an adjacent creature, you can use spirit surge to increase the victim's AC, possibly causing the attack to fail, by rolling your spirit surge die and adding it to the chosen character's AC. You must not be flat-footed, and you must be aware of the attack. If use of this ability causes the enemy's attack to miss, you can make an attack at your highest base attack bonus against that enemy as an immediate action.</p><p><b>Legendary Guardian (Supreme, Su): </b>Once per day as an immediate action, you can ignore the effects of a single attack against you, including enemy spells targeting you or whose area or effect includes you. The attack affects other creatures as normal.</p>",
