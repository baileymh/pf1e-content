The refrain seems to hang in the air each time it is repeated. When you complete the performance, the words whirl around you like an invisible cloying buffer for the next 10 minutes, reducing your base movement to half your normal speed but providing you with soft cover against all attacks.</p><p>You can additionally affect up to one willing creature per bard level within 30 feet of you with this masterpiece, but you must expend 1 round of bardic performance for each creature other than yourself to receive the cloying buffer. Creatures that leave the area lose this bonus, and do not regain it by moving back within the area.</p><p>Use: 5 bardic performance rounds, +1 round per additional creature affected.</p><p>Action: 1 minute.</p>",
