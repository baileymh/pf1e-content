      "value": "<strong>Arcanist Exploit - Outer</strong><br/><br/><p>As a swift action, the arcanist can spend 2 points from his arcane pool to sprout a pair of rubbery tentacles that grow from his upper chest. At the same time, his arms shrink into sickly, malformed stubs, capable of only rudimentary actions such as lifting small objects or making somatic gestures. Rings, bracers, and other items worn on the atrophied arms and hands remain in place, but magic items that require hands to activate cannot be used while the arcanist's arms are in this state. Likewise, the use of weapons or shields is impossible during this time. The arcanist has full control over his hideous tentacles and can use them to deliver touch spells, or as secondary natural weapons that deal tentacle damage as appropriate for a creature of the arcanist's size (1d4 for Medium arcanists, or 1d3 for Small ones) modified by 1/2 the arcanist's Strength score. The arcanist's reach with these tentacles is 5 feet longer than his normal reach.</p>",
