      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>The Lich is a spirit of power over death and the undead.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the Lich's favor, you must research fragments of how to create a personal phylactery and then outline a plan for lichdom. This requires spending 2 months visiting libraries and sites of necromantic power, followed by a successful Intelligence check. You must then vow to never destroy an intelligent undead creature, even if it attacks you first (though it is perfectly acceptable to control it with magic).</p><p><b>Seance Boon: </b>You gain a +4 bonus on damage rolls with your necromancy spells. Favored Locations: Battlefields, graveyards, tombs.</p><p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Battlefields, graveyards, tombs.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling the Lich, you must not use beneficial spells on living creatures (except yourself if you are a living creature).</p><p><b>Necromantic Arcana (Lesser, Su): </b>This functions as the archmage arcana lesser spirit power, except you gain the following spells at the indicated spell levels (even if they are not the usual spell levels for the sorcerer/wizard spell list), instead of selecting them each day: 0-bleed; 1st-chill touch; 2nd-command undead; 3rd-animate dead; 4th-enervation; 5th-magic jar; 6th-create greater undead.</p><p><b>Lesser Lichdom (Greater, Su): </b>In order to benefit from this power, you must have a proto-phylactery that costs you 10,000 gp to create (if you continue with the process of lichdom, you can upgrade this to a true phylactery by paying the difference in cost). If you die while channeling the Lich, you return from the dead in 1d10 days, reforming around the proto-phylactery and gaining 1 permanent negative level (as if subject to the resurrection spell). This process consumes the proto-phylactery. If you are already a lich, you can instead create a backup phylactery for 10,000 gp, at which you reform if your normal phylactery is destroyed. This consumes the backup phylactery.</p>",
