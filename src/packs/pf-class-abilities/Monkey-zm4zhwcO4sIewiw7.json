This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p><p><b>Major Form (beast shape II): </b>Your shape changes to that of a Large monkey (as per the dire ape; Bestiary 17). While in this form, you gain a base speed of 30 feet, a climb speed of 30 feet, low-light vision, scent (30 feet), a bite attack (1d6 damage), and two claw attacks (1d6 damage), and you can still use your hands to wield weapons, hold objects, and manipulate objects normally. At 8th level, your climb speed increases to 50 feet, and you can use your tail to hold and manipulate objects as if you had a third hand, but you cannot use it to wield weapons or shields. At 15th level, you gain a rend attack that deals extra damage equal to that of your shifter claws attack plus 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus when you hit with two of your normal shifter claws attacks.</p><p><b>Alternate Natural Attacks: </b>Bite (B, P, S)</p>",
