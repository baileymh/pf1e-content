      "value": "<strong>Psychic Discipline</strong><br/><br/><p>A hag's call echoes through your mind like a siren's song, enticing you to surrender and become something horrible. Even after you've resisted the call or even killed your hag mother, those echoes remain, shaping your mind into something else and telling you who you were meant to be. While you're almost certainly a changeling, you might be a latent psychic who came into accidental psychic contact with a hag's call through a changeling associate, or your dreams might have long been infested by a night hag's machinations.</p><p><b>Phrenic Pool Ability: </b>Charisma</p><p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>ill omen (1st), enthrall (4th), bestow curse (6th), charm monster (8th), threefold aspect (10th), veil (12th), control weather (14th), trap the soul (16th), dominate monster (18th).</p><p><b>Discipline Powers: </b>The echoes of the hag's call shapes the psychic potential of your mind, granting you exceptional abilities that might one day exceed the hag's own.</p>",
