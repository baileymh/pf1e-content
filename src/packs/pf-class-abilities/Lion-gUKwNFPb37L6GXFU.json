      "value": "<strong>Shifter Aspect</strong><br/><br/><p>Lions hunt in prides, cooperating to bring down large opponents and defend their territory. A lion's alternate attack is bite (B, P, S).</p><p><b>Minor Form: </b>You gain a +4 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p><p><b>Major Form (beast shape II): </b>Your shape changes to that of a dire lion. While in this form, you gain a base speed of 40 feet, low-light vision, and scent (30 feet). Once per day for every 2 shifter levels you have, you can utter a mighty roar, allowing you to attempt an Intimidate check with a +5 circumstance bonus to demoralize enemies within 30 feet. Allies gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against creatures affected by this ability. At 8th level, you gain one of the following teamwork feats as a bonus feat: Outflank, Pack Attack, Paired Opportunists, or Shake It Off. You can grant allies within 30 feet the benefits of this feat as a swift action for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier. At 15th level, you provide a flanking bonus to any ally who threatens the same opponent as you do, and you can change places with an adjacent ally as a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, as if using the Swap Places feat.</p><p><b>Alternate Natural Attacks: </b>Bite (B, P, S)</p>",
