This functions as per summon monster II, but you can summon only animals with the fiendish template or outsiders with the demon subtype-including any demon from the Expanded Monster Summoning Options table (Pathfinder Player Companion Monster Summoner's Handbook 28). This ability can summon only one creature, regardless of the list used. For every 2 medium levels beyond 6th, the level of the summon monster spell increases by 1 (to a maximum of summon monster IX at 20th level). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p><p><b>Demonic Taint (Gift, Su): </b>Your natural weapons, as well as any weapons you wield, are treated as chaotic and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>",
