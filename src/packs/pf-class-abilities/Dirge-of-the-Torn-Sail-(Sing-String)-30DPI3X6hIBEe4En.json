All creatures within 30 feet who can hear your performance must succeed at a Will saving throw or be compelled to flee from you, as per greater command. For creatures on a ship, this effect means taking efforts to alter course and sail away. An affected creature continues its efforts for as long as the performance continues, and it reacts with violence to anyone attempting to prevent it from fleeing. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance) affect this masterpiece.</p><p>Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.</p><p>Action: 1 standard action.</p>",
