      "value": "<strong>Bard - Masterpieces</strong><br/><br/><p>This complex dance makes you difficult to strike.</p><p>Prerequisite: Perform (dance) 4 ranks.</p><p>Cost: Feat or 2nd-level bard spell known.</p><p>Effect: The shuffling steps, bends, and leaps of this intricate dance make you a difficult target to hit, but also make it more difficult for you to perform other actions. When using this masterpiece, you take a -2 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, and you must make a concentration check to cast any spell (DC 15 + the spell's level), but you gain a +2 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. When you have 8 ranks in Perform (dance), and every 4 ranks thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the dodge bonus increases by +1. You can combine this masterpiece with fighting defensively and Combat Expertise, but not total defense. When you use this masterpiece, it lasts until the start of your next turn. Abilities that extend the duration of a bardic performance (such as Lingering Performance) affect this masterpiece; this allows you to get multiple rounds of its benefit (and its penalties) at the cost of only 1 round of bardic performance.</p><p>Use: 1 bardic performance round.</p><p>Action: 1 free action.</p>",
