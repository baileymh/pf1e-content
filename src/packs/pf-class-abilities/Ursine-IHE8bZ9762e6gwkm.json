      "value": "<strong>Vigilante - Wild Soul Course</strong><br/><br/><p>These wildsouls have the blood of bears running through their veins.</p><p><i>Deadly Claws (Ex): </i>At 2nd level, an ursine wildsoul's hands become claws in his vigilante identity, granting him two claw attacks. These are primary natural attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage if he is Medium or 1d3 if he is Small.</p><p><i>Bear Jaws (Ex): </i>At 6th level, an ursine wildsoul gains a bite attack while in his vigilante identity. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of damage if he is Medium or 1d3 if he is Small.</p><p><i>Thick Hide (Ex): </i>At 12th level, an ursine wildsoul in his vigilante identity has skin that bristles with thick hair like that of a bear's. He gains a natural armor bonus of +1. This natural armor bonus increases by 1 at 16th and 20th levels.</p><p><i>Bear Form (Su): </i>At 18th level, an ursine wildsoul has learned how to take a bear's form. He can change into bear form as a standard action, at will, and the transformation lasts until he changes back. While transformed, he becomes a grizzly bear (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 31) as beast shape II. An ursine wildsoul loses his ability to speak while in bear form and is limited to the sounds that a normal bear can make, though he can communicate normally with other bears, as speak with animal.</p>",
