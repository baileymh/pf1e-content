      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>The Butcher is a spirit of blood, violence, murder, and pain.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the Butcher's favor, you must deal a total number of hit points of bleed damage equal to twice your medium level to two dozen non-mindless living creatures, inflicting as much pain and suffering as possible. You must next vow to never use the Heal skill or magical healing to heal or treat another creature, then succeed at a Strength check.</p><p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Abattoirs, battlefields, execution sites.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling the Butcher, you must not attack with bludgeoning weapons in combat and must never deal nonlethal damage. You must also kill all your defeated foes in combat, although you can accept surrender or take prisoners for the purpose of torturing and then killing those prisoners later (but before the Butcher departs).</p><p><b>Bladesharp (Lesser, Ex): </b>You gain proficiency in all slashing martial weapons and the spiked chain. Any slashing weapon or spiked chain you wield gains the deadly weapon special quality (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 22) and on a critical hit deals an amount of bleed damage equal to the weapon's critical multiplier - 1.</p><p><b>Bloodletter (Intermediate, Ex): </b>The Butcher enhances a single slashing weapon or spiked chain, allowing you to add the keen, mighty cleaving, or wounding special abilities to the weapon when you wield it. As a swift action, you can allow the Butcher to gain 1 point of influence over you to make that weapon vorpal until the end of your turn, though the vorpal special ability doesn't work with abilities that let you choose the result of your d20 roll. Each time you kill a creature whose CR is greater than your medium level with this vorpal special ability, the butcher gains an additional point of influence over you.</p>",
