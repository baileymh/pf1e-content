      "value": "<strong>Variant Domain Power</strong><br/><br/><p><b>Associated Domain(s) </b>: Repose</p><p>The Lady of Graves seeks the destruction of undead, be they corporeal or manifested spirits. Inquisitors of Pharasma scour the world for signs of the undead, destroying such abominations on sight by means both traditional and esoteric in nature. As a result, most people come first to the church of Pharasma when seeking assistance against foul spirits. One unusual facet of Pharasma's faithful is their reluctance to excise non-undead spirits, such as demons or devils. Only the most altruistic of Pharasmin priests offer their services against possessing outsiders, as most faithful see battling such foes as being beyond their true calling.</p><p><b>Exorcism of Undeath (Sp): </b>Once per day as a full-round action, you can try to end any possession spells or effects, or effects that directly exercise mental control over a creature, as long as the effect was caused by an undead creature. You must touch the affected creature (this requires a melee touch attack if the target is neither willing nor helpless) and use a vial of holy water as a material component that is consumed as part of using this ability. The target must immediately attempt a new Will save against the original save DC of the controlling effect. If the save is successful, the possession effect immediately ends, as if the target had succeeded at its original saving throw. If the possessing force is a ghost or similar undead, it manifests adjacent to the target and is staggered for 1 round.</p><p>This replaces the ward against death domain power of the Repose domain.</p>",
