      "value": "<strong>Cavalier/Samurai Order</strong><br/><br/><p>Knowledge is the stepping stone of both truth and power. The members of this order devote themselves to the preservation of knowledge. Most would protect written knowledge at all costs, but there are members that believe there is such thing as knowledge too dangerous to be allowed to exist, and seek to destroy it.</p><p><b>Edicts: </b>An order of the tome cavalier must protect written knowledge (or at least approved knowledge) at all costs. Some are also devoted to the destruction of proscribed knowledge and are equally zealous in the pursuit of its destruction. Most of these cavaliers believe that the preservation of a written work is more important than a single life, even their own, as it ensures future generations benefit from its wisdom.</p><p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever an order of the tome cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +2 bonus on all saving throws against spells or spell-like abilities cast by the subject of his challenge and a +2 bonus on all Bluff and Sense motive checks involving the subject of his challenge.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the tome cavalier adds Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (religion), and Linguistics to his list of class skills. Furthermore, he can use Linguistics untrained. If he has ranks in Linguistics, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p><p><b>Order Abilities: </b>A cavalier belonging to the order of the tome gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>",
