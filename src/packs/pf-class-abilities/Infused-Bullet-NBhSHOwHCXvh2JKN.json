      "value": "<strong>Gunslinger Deeds</strong><br/><br/><p>At 1st level, a planar rifter's bullets carry the essence of a plane to which his grit pool is attuned, striking true against creatures that shrink from that plane's nature. As long as he has at least 1 point in his grit pool, he gains the following benefits: if he infuses his bullets with an alignment, his bullet's damage counts as that alignment for the purposes of overcoming DR; if he infuses his bullets with an element, half of his bullet's damage changes to an energy type determined by the element infused: acid (earth), cold (water), electricity (air), or fire (fire).</p>",
