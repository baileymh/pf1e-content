They scour old crypts, graveyards, and battlefields to bring eternal rest.</p><p><b>Edicts: </b>The cavalier must protect the common folk from the scourge of the undead. He must seek out and destroy the restless dead and give aid to those haunted by them. He must protect those who cannot defend themselves, and root out sources that birth the corruption of life and death.</p><p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever an order of the shroud cavalier issues a challenge to an undead creature, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target of his challenge for 1 minute. The bonus increases by 1 for every 4 class levels the cavalier possesses.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the shroud cavalier adds Knowledge (local) (Int) and Knowledge (religion) (Int) to his list of class skills. An order of the shroud cavalier can attempt Knowledge (religion) checks untrained. If he has ranks in that skill, as long as a Knowledge (religion) check involves undead or haunts, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p><p><b>Order Abilities: </b>A cavalier belonging to the order of the shroud gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>",
