      "value": "<strong>Vigilante - Wild Soul Course</strong><br/><br/><p>These wildsouls have the blood of falcons or other large birds of prey running through their veins.</p><p><i>Soft Landing (Ex): </i>At 2nd level, a falconine wildsoul can grow feathery wing-flaps under his arms that allow him to fall slowly. He gains the perfect fall vigilante talent.</p><p><i>Eagle Eye (Ex) </i>At 6th level, a falconine wildsoul hones his visual senses. He gains a competence bonus equal to half his vigilante level on visual Perception checks.</p><p><i>Take to the Air (Ex) </i>At 12th level, a falconine wildsoul can harness the flight inherent in his blood. While in his vigilante identity, he has feathery wings that grant him a fly speed of 40 feet (with good maneuverability).</p><p><i>Deadly Dive (Ex): </i>At 18th level, a falconine wildsoul has learned how to mimic the swooping and diving of birds of prey. As a full-round action while he is flying at least 30 feet above the ground, a falconine wildsoul can dive onto a creature by moving up to twice his fly speed and make a single melee attack. The movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal, and the attack provokes an attack of opportunity from the attack's target. If the attack is successful, the falconine wildsoul deals the attack's damage plus 2d6 points of damage for every 10 feet he dove (to a maximum of 20d6 damage if he dove 100 feet or more). Even if the attack misses, the target still takes the extra damage for the distance of the dive, but it receives a Reflex save to halve the damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the falconine wildsoul's vigilante level + his Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher). A falconine vigilante can dive in this way a number of times per day equal to his Strength or Dexterity modifier, whichever is higher.</p>",
