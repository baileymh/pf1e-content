At 4th level, her bite is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 7th level, her bite is also treated as cold iron and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 10th level, her bite is also treated as a chaotic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. At 16th level, her bite is treated as an adamantine weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness. A barbarian must have the animal fury rage power and be at least 4th level to select this rage power.</p>",
