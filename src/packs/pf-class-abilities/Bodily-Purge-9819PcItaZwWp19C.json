      "value": "<strong>Psychic Discipline Power</strong><br/><br/><p>You can heal your own wounds and maladies with the power of thought alone. At 5th level, you gain access to a daily pool of healing energy. This pool starts with 3 d8 dice per day, and gains 1 additional d8 for every 2 psychic levels you possess beyond 5th. As a standard action, you can use up any number of these dice to regain a number of hit points equal to the result of rolling that many d8s. For example, at 5th level you could regain 3d8 hit points all at once, 1d8 hit points three separate times, or 1d8 hit points once and 2d8 hit points at a different time. In addition, you can expend 2 dice from this pool to instead gain the benefit of lesser restoration (affecting yourself only). At 7th level, you can expend 3 dice from this pool to instead gain the benefit of neutralize poison, remove disease, or restoration (affecting yourself only). To use restoration to dispel a permanent negative level, you must expend 4 dice from this pool instead of 3. Use your psychic level as your caster level for these effects.</p>",
