      "value": "<strong>Bard - Masterpieces</strong><br/><br/><p>This poem of sadness and longing was developed by a Riftwarden bard seeking a way to fight summoned creatures without violence. Its otherworldly lyrics drive outsiders to return to their planes of origin.</p><p>Prerequisite: Perform (oratory) or Perform (sing) 5 ranks; ability to speak Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Ignan, Infernal, or Terran.</p><p>Cost: Feat or 2nd-level bard spell known.</p><p>Effect: This mournful poem beckons outsiders back to the plane on which they were spawned, making them pine for their true home. Any summoned non-native outsiders who can hear this performance must each succeed at a Will save or feel compelled to return to their home plane. If an outsider fails its save, each round of the performance expends 2 rounds of the remaining duration of any spell or effect that summoned that creature to the current plane (in addition to the normal duration that passes each round). Called outsiders who fail their Will saves against this masterpiece take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws for the performance's duration. If the performer can't speak the native tongue of the outsider's home plane, the outsider gains a +4 bonus on its Will save against this effect.</p><p>Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.</p><p>Action: 1 full round.</p>",
