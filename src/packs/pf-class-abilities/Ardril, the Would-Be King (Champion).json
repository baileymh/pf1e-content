      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>The Would-Be King is an Ulfen folk hero famous for slaying nearly a dozen linnorms but refusing to rule any nation until she had slain Fafnheir, the father of all linnorms. The Linnorm Kings at the time were fearful of losing their positions and sent their own warriors to kill her. Ardril barely escaped with her life, and she fled her home for Valenhall.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain Ardril's favor, you must defeat an enemy with the dragon type and at least 7 Hit Dice without any aid from allies. After defeating the enemy, you must attempt a Wisdom check as you are bombarded with the memory of a linnorm's curse. If you succeed, Ardril answers your call.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Ardril, you must never seek out or accept any position of power or leadership.</p><p><b>Challenge (Lesser, Su): </b>You gain the challenge ability as a cavalier of your level. When you challenge a foe, your attacks ignore any damage reduction your target has. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws until the challenge ends.</p><p><b>Death Curse (Supreme, Su): </b>When you channel Ardril, you can select any two linnorm death curse rage powers. You can select different rage powers each time you channel Ardril. Treat your medium level as your barbarian level for the purpose of meeting prerequisites. You gain the benefit of these rage powers against challenged foes even if you are not raging. For each additional point of damage that would be dealt by a rage power, you deal 1d6 points of damage instead.</p>",
