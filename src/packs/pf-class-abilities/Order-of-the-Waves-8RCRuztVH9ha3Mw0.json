This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 class levels the cavalier has.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>A cavalier belonging to the order of the waves adds Knowledge (geography) and Perception to his class skills. He can attempt Knowledge (geography) checks untrained, but if he has ranks in the skill, he adds half his cavalier level (minimum 1) to all Knowledge (geography) checks that involve finding an underwater location.</p><p><b>Order Abilities: </b>A cavalier belonging to this order gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>",
