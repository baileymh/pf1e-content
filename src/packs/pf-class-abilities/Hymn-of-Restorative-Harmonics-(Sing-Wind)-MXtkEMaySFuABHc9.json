An ally who is exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, sickened, staggered, or stunned as the result of a previously failed saving throw can attempt a new saving throw to immediately end one of the above effects. Characters under multiple effects must choose which effect they wish to attempt to end prematurely. Effects that did not grant a save to resist (such as the stun effect of power word stun) can't be ended by this masterpiece.</p><p>In addition, anyone who observed this performance gains the effects of delay poison at a caster level equal to your bard level.</p><p>Use: 3 bardic performance rounds.</p><p>Action: 1 full round.</p>",
