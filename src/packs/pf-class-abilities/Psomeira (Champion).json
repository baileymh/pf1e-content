      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>Psomeira was a prodigy captain in the Liachoran guard. It was her spear that forced the beast Ousmariku back into the sea, though not before it laid the city to ruin. Psomeira went missing following the battle and was presumed dead, but she returned a decade later in Aelyosos, and quickly stepped up to train the city for the battle against Ousmariku which she feels is inevitable.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain Psomeira's favor, you first must travel to the ruins of Liachora. On the beach where Psomeira fought the sea monster Ousmariku, you must swear an oath to defend civilization from senseless violence wherever you find it. You must then succeed at a Strength check, and if you do, Psomeira will answer your call.</p><p><b>Seance Boon: </b>You gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls against creatures that are at least one size category larger than you.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Psomeira, you must attack any hostile Huge or larger creature on sight.</p><p><b>Divine Vengeance (Lesser, Su): </b>As a divine warrior, you can cast each of the following spells once per day: align weapon (lawful), magic weapon, and shield of faith. Use your medium level in place of a cleric level. These spells do not count toward your regular allotment of spells per day, but you must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell's level to cast them.</p><p><b>Spiritual Force (Greater, Su): </b>Add divine power, greater magic weapon, and magic vestment to the list of spells you can cast once per day, following the same rules as the divine vengeance spirit power.</p>",
