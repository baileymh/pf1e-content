      "value": "<strong>Cavalier/Samurai Order Abilitiy</strong><br/><br/><p>At 2nd level, the cavalier can prepare for the terrain through which he will be traveling with 48 hours of study and customization of his equipment. He can select any terrain type from the list available to a ranger for his favored terrain class feature. While in the selected terrain, the cavalier gains a +2 bonus on initiative checks and on Knowledge (geography), Perception, Stealth, and Survival skill checks. At 8th level and every 6 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1. Additionally, when calculating overland movement speed in the selected terrain, the cavalier and his mount treat trackless terrain as though it contains a road or trail, and terrain with a road or trail as though it were a highway. If traveling along a highway, the cavalier and his mount can travel for 10 hours before needing to attempt Constitution checks for a forced march.</p>",
