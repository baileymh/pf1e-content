      "value": "<strong>Sorcerer Bloodline</strong><br/><br/><p>Whether you were raised on the Astral Plane, had an ancestor with a strong connection to the Astral, or simply had a freak brush with an astral conduit in your youth, you have an unusual connection to both time and space. Your senses extend through the Astral Plane to the far reaches of the multiverse, allowing you to perceive and manipulate the timeless potential that binds the multiverse together. Your ancestors may have also held a connection to one of the astral isles or conduits, or like you, may have plied this cosmic ocean-and some may even survive there to this day.</p><p><b>Class Skill: </b>Knowledge (planes).</p><p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>true strike (3rd), false life (5th), sands of time (7th), wandering star motes (9th), permanency (11th), contingency (13th), ethereal jaunt (15th), create demiplane (17th), time stop (19th).</p><p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Forge Ring, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Quicken Spell, Skill Focus (Knowledge [planes]), Weapon Finesse.</p><p><b>Bloodline Arcana: </b>When you cast a spell, you can choose to enhance the next spell you cast before the end of your next turn, increasing the enhanced spell's saving throw DC by 1.
