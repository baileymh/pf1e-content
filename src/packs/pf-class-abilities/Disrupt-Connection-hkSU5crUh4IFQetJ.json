      "value": "<strong>Witch Hex</strong><br/><br/><p>The hexer disrupts the connection between a summoned creature within 30 feet and its master. The summoned creature must succeed at a Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. While it's confused in this way, during any round in which the percentile die roll to determine the creature's confusion result is 76-100, the affected creature instead acts as if the hexer had summoned it (attacking the hexer's enemies or performing such other tasks that the hexer can communicate to it). At 8th level, this hex causes the summoned creature to act as if the hexer had summoned it on a result of 51-100. At 16th level, this hex causes the summoned creature to act this way on a result of 26-100. The cackle hex extends the duration of this hex by 1 round. Once a creature has been the target of this hex, that creature is immune to this hex for 24 hours.</p>",
