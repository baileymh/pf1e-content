      "value": "<strong>Wizard Arcane School</strong><br/><br/><p>Aether is a strange and complex substance that occurs where the Elemental Planes touch the Ethereal Plane. Wizards who study aether use it to manipulate objects on the Material Plane. The aether elemental school is an elemental arcane school a wizard can specialize in instead of one of the standard schools of magic.</p><p>Like a normal arcane school, the aether elemental school grants a number of school powers, as well as one bonus spell slot of each level the wizard can cast, from 1st on up. This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a spell from the aether elemental school's spell list (see below). Unlike a normal arcane school, the aether elemental school requires the wizard to select a single element as his opposition school (air, earth, fire, or water, from pages 142-143 of the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide, for example). The wizard does not need to select a second opposition school. He must expend two spell slots to prepare a spell from his opposed elemental school as normal.</p><h>Aether Elementalist Wizard Spells</h><p>0 - telekinetic projectile</p><p>1st - floating disk, magic missile, unseen servant</p><p>2nd - ablative barrier, blur, pilfering hand, spiritual weapon</p><p>3rd - blink, ectoplasmic snare, force punch, tiny hut</p><p>4th - resilient sphere, spiritual ally, telekinetic charge, telekinetic maneuver</p><p>5th - condensed ether, ethereal envelope, interposing hand, mage's faithful hound, secret chest, telekinesis, wall of ectoplasm</p><p>6th - animate objects, enemy hammer, forceful hand, leashed shackles</p><p>7th - ectoplasmic eruption, ethereal jaunt, grasping hand, phase door</p><p>8th - clenched fist, telekinetic sphere</p><p>9th - etherealness, telekinetic storm</p>",
