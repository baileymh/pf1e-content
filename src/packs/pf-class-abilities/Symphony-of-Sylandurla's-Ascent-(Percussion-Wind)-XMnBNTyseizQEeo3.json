You must choose the condition before activating the performance and can't change your choice during the performance. If any affected ally currently has the chosen condition, she can attempt a new saving throw against it each round she can hear your song. Success on this saving throw has its usual benefit, but failure has no effect at all. This performance relies on audible components.</p><p>Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.</p><p>Action: 1 full round.</p>",
