      "value": "<strong>Unchained Rogue Skill Unlock</strong><br/><br/><p>With sufficient ranks in Escape Artist, you earn the following.</p><p><b>5 Ranks: </b>If you take a -10 penalty, the time required to use this skill is halved; escaping a grapple or pin is a move action, and escaping a net, animate rope, command plants, or control plants spell is a standard action.</p><p><b>10 Ranks: </b>You can attempt to escape from any entangling effect as a standard action with an Escape Artist check (DC = the effect's save DC + 10). You can attempt an Escape Artist check as a move action to set the DC for a creature to escape from ropes or bindings; you gain a +10 bonus on the check if you instead attempt it as a full-round action.</p><p><b>15 Ranks: </b>You can escape any entangling effect (as above) as a move action. As a standard action, you can attempt an Escape Artist check (DC = the effect's save DC + 20) to suppress a slow or paralysis effect for 1 round, plus 1 round for every 5 by which you exceed the DC. This action counts as purely mental for the purpose of being able to take it while paralyzed.</p><p><b>20 Ranks: </b>You can escape being entangled, grappled, or pinned as an immediate action with an Escape Artist check (DC = the effect's DC + 10 or the attacker's CMB + 10). You can attempt to suppress a slow or paralysis effect as a standard action (increasing the DC by 10), a move action (increasing the DC by 15), or an immediate action (increasing the DC by 20).</p>",
