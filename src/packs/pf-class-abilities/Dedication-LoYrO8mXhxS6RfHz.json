      "value": "<strong>Phantom Emotional Focus</strong><br/><br/><p>Either through a sense of love or the desire to finish some unfinished task, a phantom with this emotional focus has an undying devotion to something or someone in the world. It's often the case that a phantom with this emotional focus has a strong familial tie with its spiritualist master. A dedication phantom most often appears as a strong and stern protector with a watchful gaze, and its service to its spiritualist is unwavering. These spirits exude auras of blue, or sometimes rose if their love for their spiritualist masters in life was great. Many times these auras manifest as a halo, giving these phantoms a divine appearance, no matter their actual alignment or opinions on matters of religion.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Diplomacy and Sense Motive equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p><p><b>Good Saves: </b>Reflex and Will.</p><p><b>Iron Will: </b>The phantom gains Iron Will as a bonus feat. Furthermore, when the phantom is within its master's consciousness, it grants the benefits of Iron Will to its master if its master doesn't have that feat.</p><p><b>Dutiful Strike (Su): </b>When a creature makes an attack against the phantom's master, the phantom gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against that target, and deals damage against that target as if the phantom were one size category larger. For the purposes of this ability, an attack includes any harmful spell targeting the spiritualist master of whose area or effect includes the spiritualist master. Dutiful strike lasts for 1 minute, until another creature attacks the phantom's spiritualist master (at which point this effect transfers to the new attacker), or until the attacking creature is reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, whichever occurs first.</p><p><b>Defending Aura (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom can emit a 10-foot-radius aura that grants protection to nearby allies. It can activate this aura at will as a swift action. Allies within the aura gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to CMD and on all saving throws. Deactivating the aura is a free action.</p><p><b>Devoted Servant (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level and is caught unawares by an attack (such as an attack made in a surprise round or while the spiritualist is asleep or an attack by a creature using Stealth), if the phantom is not fully manifested, it automatically fully manifests from the spiritualist's consciousness to protect its master. The phantom stays manifested as long as the spiritualist is unaware and in danger. This ability requires no action from the spiritualist.</p><p><b>Steadfast Devotion (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom becomes immune to detrimental mind-affecting effects and all forms of possession, such as magic jar and possession (see page 181). Furthermore, the phantom is immune to banishment, dismissal, and similar effects.</p>",
