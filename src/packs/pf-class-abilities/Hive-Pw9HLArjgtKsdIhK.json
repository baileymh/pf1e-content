      "value": "<strong>Oracle Curse</strong><br/><br/><p>You were exposed at a young age (perhaps even before you were born) to the alien species known as the hive, but this exposure did not result in a full-blown infestation by these otherworldly monsters. Others (including animals) find the unsightly spines and rough growths that periodically emerge from your flesh to be disturbing and distracting, and you take a -4 penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, and Ride checks. Once per day as a standard action, you can cough up an ovoid, leathery sphere that can be hurled as a flask of acid, though it becomes inert after 24 hours. At 5th level, you gain the benefits of endure elements in hot environments and are immune to infestations (save for those from the hive itself ). At 10th level, your skin deformities grow numerous enough to increase your natural armor bonus by 1. At 15th level, you gain acid resistance 20.</p>",
