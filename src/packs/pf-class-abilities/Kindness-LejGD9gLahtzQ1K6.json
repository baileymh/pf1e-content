      "value": "<strong>Phantom Emotional Focus</strong><br/><br/><p>A phantom with this emotional focus was a being with a generous heart in life and continues to remain that way well after death. The phantom's intense generosity compels it to remain a phantom and continue assisting the living, especially relatives or those who had been its good friends during its living years. Kindness phantoms have pleasant and gentle demeanors and speak with a melodic cadence, putting most who see them at ease. Their auras are bright emerald green with occasional fluctuating scarlet or golden hues.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>The phantom gains a number of ranks in Diplomacy and Heal equal to its number of Hit Dice. While confined in the spiritualist's consciousness, the phantom grants the spiritualist Skill Focus in each of these skills.</p><p><b>Good Saves: </b>Fortitude and Will.</p><p><b>Benevolent: </b>When the phantom uses the aid another action, the bonus granted by a successful check increases by 1. If the phantom aids the spiritualist this way, the bonus instead increases by 2.</p><p><b>Opening Strike (Su): </b>As a standard action, the phantom can make a melee attack against a foe. If this attack hits, the spiritualist designates one ally threatening that enemy. This ally can make a single attack at his full base attack bonus against that enemy as an immediate action.</p><p><b>Etheric Healing (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 7th level, the phantom gains the lay on hands ability with an effective paladin level equal to its Hit Dice. The phantom can use this ability on the spiritualist as a swift action.</p><p><b>Expanded Aid (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 12th level, the phantom can use the aid another action as a move action. Additionally, the phantom selects four mercies available to a 12th-level paladin that it adds to its lay on hands ability.</p><p><b>Exceptional Aid (Su): </b>When the spiritualist reaches 17th level, the phantom can use the aid another action as a swift action. Additionally, when designating an ally for an opening strike, that ally gains a bonus equal to the phantom's Charisma modifier on damage rolls for the attack granted to him.</p><h>Other Kindess-Focused Abilities</h><p>If a spiritualist archetype allows the selection of an additional focus, add kindness to the list of available foci. In addition, a bloodrager with the id rager archetype (Pathfinder Player Companion: Occult Origins 23) can select kindness as his emotional focus. Add the following to other character options (all are found in Pathfinder RPG Occult Adventures unless otherwise noted) for spiritualists with kindness phantoms.</p><p><b>Emotional Conduit (Feat): </b>1st-charm person, 2nd- blessing of courage and lifeAPG, 3rd-good hope, 4th-mass charm person, 5th-waves of ecstasy, 6th-sympathy.</p><p><b>Fractured Mind (Archetype): </b>Bless (5th), calm emotions (7th), heroism (9th), good hope (16th).</p><p><b>Spirit-Bound Blade (Spell): </b>The weapon also gains the allyingUE special ability.</p>",
