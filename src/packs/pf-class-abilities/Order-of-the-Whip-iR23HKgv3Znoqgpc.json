Cavaliers of this order inflict pain upon those they engage and capture those who submit.</p><p><b>Edicts: </b>The cavalier must seek out those weaker than himself to punish and torture. He must force others to obey his commands without question. He must strive to cause pain and suffering wherever possible. Since these edicts are evil, he must be of an evil alignment.</p><p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever an order of the whip cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on all melee damage rolls against the target of his challenge as long as he damaged the creature in the previous round. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels the cavalier has (to a maximum of +5 at 17th level).</p><p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the whip cavalier adds Knowledge (local) and Knowledge (nobility) to his list of class skills. Whenever an order of the whip cavalier uses Intimidate to force another creature to do what he says, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p><p><b>Order Abilities: </b>A cavalier who belongs to the order of the whip gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>",
