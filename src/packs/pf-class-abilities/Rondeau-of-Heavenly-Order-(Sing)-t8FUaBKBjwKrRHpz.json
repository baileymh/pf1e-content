      "value": "<strong>Bard - Masterpieces</strong><br/><br/><p>Your carefully structured song imposes rigid order on your listeners.</p><p>Prerequisite: Perform (sing) 4 ranks.</p><p>Cost: Feat or 2nd-level bard spell known.</p><p>Effect: This song follows a set repetition of verses and refrains with a pattern of syllables that remains constant from line to line. As you sing, listeners find their actions bound by your song's relentless order. One enemy per bard level within listening range must make a successful Will save or find its movements hampered. A creature that fails its save can move only in a straight line each turn. The creature can choose which direction it wishes to move each turn, but it can move only along a straight line in that direction, and cannot move around corners or otherwise deviate from this line until its next turn. This effect lasts as long as you maintain the performance. Although this song has words, it is not language-dependent.</p><p>Use: 1 bardic performance round per round.</p><p>Action: 1 round.</p>",
