      "value": "<strong>Shifter Aspect</strong><br/><br/><p>This aspect unlocks the brutal ferocity and tenacious fury of the wolverine. The wolverine's lust for battle invigorates its will to live, and it can press on in battle longer than its enemies expect.</p><p><b>Minor Form: </b>You gain 1 additional hit point per Hit Die you have, and treat your Constitution score as 4 points higher than it is for the purpose of determining when you die at negative hit points. At 8th level, you gain Diehard as a bonus feat. At 15th level, you treat your Constitution as being 8 points higher for the purpose of determining when you die at negative hit points.</p><p><b>Major Form (beast shape II): </b>Your shape changes to that of a dire wolverine (Bestiary 279). While in this form, you gain a base speed of 30 feet, a climb speed of 10 feet, low-light vision, scent (30 feet), a bite attack (1d6 damage), and two claw attacks (1d8 damage). While in dire wolverine form, you gain the barbarian's rage power, but can activate this rage only in a round after you've taken damage. You can rage for a number of rounds each day equal to your shifter level. This ability otherwise functions the same as the barbarian rage ability (unlike a dire wolverine, you can choose to end this rage voluntarily). At 8th level, you can choose two barbarian rage powers, treating your shifter level as your effective barbarian level for the purposes of meeting prerequisites. At 15th level, you are no longer fatigued at the end of your rage.</p><p><b>Alternate Natural Attacks: </b>Bite (B, P, S)</p>",
