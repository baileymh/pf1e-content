      "value": "<strong>Phantom Emotional Focus</strong><br/><br/><p>Grim phantoms influenced by Apollyon, the Horseman of Pestilence, often have rams' skulls for heads.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>The grim phantom gains ranks in Acrobatics and Heal equal to its number of Hit Dice.</p><p><b>Good Saves: </b>Fortitude and Will.</p><p><b>Great Fortitude: </b>The grim phantom gains Great Fortitude as a bonus feat.</p><p><b>Weakening Strike (Su): </b>A creature hit by the grim phantom's slam attack must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or take a -2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for 1d4 rounds. This is a disease effect. Penalties from multiple hits don't stack.</p><p><b>Aura of Flies (Su): </b>At 7th level, the grim phantom can surround itself with a cloud of biting flies as a swift action. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to the grim phantom takes 1d6 piercing damage. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 4 spiritualist levels beyond 7th. Ending the aura is a free action.</p><p><b>Contagious Touch (Sp): </b>At 12th level, the grim phantom can cast contagion three times per day as a spell-like ability.</p><p><b>Virulent Attack (Su): </b>At 17th level, any creature under the effects of the grim phantom's weakening strike becomes a dangerous vector for disease. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to the target creature is immediately exposed to any diseases the target creature has, no matter the normal method of contracting that disease. The creature must immediately attempt a saving throw against that disease, and the onset period doesn't apply.</p>",
