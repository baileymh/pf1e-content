      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>Eccardian Drovenge, son of Mammon, was slain atop the Arodennama during a bid for rulership of Westcrown, in a battle that saw the collapse of the Council of Thieves. It was Aspexia's accidental communion with his spirit during a recent seance at the monument that inspired her to rebuild the Council of Thieves in its new incarnation.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the Prince's favor, you must climb atop the 90-foot-tall Arodennama in Westcrown. There, you must pour oil down the statue's cheeks, then set the oil afire. You must vow to seek political influence, and then succeed at a Charisma check (DC = 10 + half your medium level). Tieflings gain a +5 bonus on this check.</p><p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Monuments, noble homes, thieves' dens, anywhere in Westcrown.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>Eccardian's pride demanded that his victims know whose hand they died by. If you accept a taboo while channeling the Prince, you must not attack any foe who is completely unaware of your presence.</p><p><b>Master Duelist (Greater, Su): </b>While wielding a light or one-handed piercing weapon, you gain a +3 dodge bonus to your AC against melee attacks. Your surprise strike damage also applies to attacks against creatures you are flanking.</p>",
