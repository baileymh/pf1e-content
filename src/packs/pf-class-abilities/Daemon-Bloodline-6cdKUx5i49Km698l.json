      "value": "<strong>Sorcerer Bloodline</strong><br/><br/><p>A daemon lurks somewhere along your family tree. Your powers derive from these soul-devouring fiends, who take pleasure and gain power from manipulating mortal frailties like aging, pestilence, famine, and the horrors of war. Your lineage gives you great insight into how to exploit the weaknesses of living beings and how to use leeched soul energy to enhance your wicked abilities. Bonus feats marked with an asterisk (*) are detailed in the Advanced Player's Guide.</p><p><b>Class Skill: </b>Heal.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>ray of enfeeblement (3rd), touch of idiocy (5th), vampiric touch (7th), contagion (9th), blight (11th), circle of death (13th), waves of exhaustion (15th), horrid wilting (17th), soul bind (19th).</p><p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>Diehard, Endurance, Fast Healer*, Great Fortitude, Heroic Defiance*, Heroic Recovery*, Sickening Spell*, Toughness.</p><p><b>Bloodline Arcana: </b>Whenever you cast a spell that kills one or more living creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, the caster level of any spell you cast in the next round increases by +1 for each creature your first spell killed. This ability does not stack with other effects that increase your effective caster level, and you cannot gain a bonus greater than 1/2 your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). The second spell you cast must be of an equal or lower level than the first one.</p><p><b>Bloodline Powers: </b>Like that of a daemon, your magic derives from painful and lingering death.</p>",
