The epic has no fixed form and has substantial room for improvisation; many bards include tales of their own wise ancestors, or the ancestors of noteworthy members of their audience. When you activate the performance, one target creature other than you within close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels) gains the benefit of a commune spell. You must continue the performance for the target to receive answers, as your retelling is magically guided to include relevant responses. If you cease the performance before the target has asked all of its questions, or if you run out of bardic performance rounds, any remaining questions are lost.</p><p>Use: 10 bardic performance rounds, plus 1 bardic performance round per question.</p><p>Action: 10 minutes.</p>",
