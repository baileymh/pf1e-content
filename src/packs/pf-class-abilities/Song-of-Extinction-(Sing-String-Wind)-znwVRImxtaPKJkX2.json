The affected area is treated as per the spell earthquake. In addition, all creatures in the area except for the performer must make DC 25 Reflex saves, as individual earthen maws open beneath each. Those who fail fall into a 100-foot-deep pit that quickly grinds shut, trapping them as if they were in the bury zone of an avalanche and trapped without air. If any living, sentient creature is killed by the Song of Extinction's effects, the performer ceases to age for 1 year.</p><p>Use: All of the performer's uses of bardic performance for that day.</p><p>Action: 5 full rounds.</p>",
