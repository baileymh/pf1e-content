This penalty increases by 1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the staff cavalier adds Knowledge (arcana) (Int) and Knowledge (nature) (Int) to his list of class skills. He may use Knowledge (arcana) to identify spells being cast by arcane spellcasters as if he were using Spellcraft, and may do the same with Knowledge (nature) for divine spellcasters. If the cavalier readies an action to strike a creature when it casts a spell, and identifies the spell to be cast with the appropriate Knowledge check, he gains a +1 bonus on the attack roll.</p><p><b>Order Abilities: </b>A cavalier who belongs to the order of the staff gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>",
