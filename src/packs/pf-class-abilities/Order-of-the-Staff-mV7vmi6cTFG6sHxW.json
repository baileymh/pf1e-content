      "value": "<strong>Cavalier/Samurai Order</strong><br/><br/><p>Cavaliers belonging to the order of the staff dedicate their lives to guarding and assisting spellcasters, especially wizards and druids, and to overcoming those who seek to destroy items and locations of magical import.</p><p><b>Edicts: </b>The cavalier cannot refuse a spellcaster's request for aid unless it will interfere with his existing duties, or he believes the spellcaster seeks to directly oppose the cavalier's aims and goals.</p><p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever an order of the staff cavalier issues a challenge, his target takes a -1 penalty on saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities for 1 round after the cavalier successfully damages the target. This penalty increases by 1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the staff cavalier adds Knowledge (arcana) (Int) and Knowledge (nature) (Int) to his list of class skills. He may use Knowledge (arcana) to identify spells being cast by arcane spellcasters as if he were using Spellcraft, and may do the same with Knowledge (nature) for divine spellcasters. If the cavalier readies an action to strike a creature when it casts a spell, and identifies the spell to be cast with the appropriate Knowledge check, he gains a +1 bonus on the attack roll.</p><p><b>Order Abilities: </b>A cavalier who belongs to the order of the staff gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>",
