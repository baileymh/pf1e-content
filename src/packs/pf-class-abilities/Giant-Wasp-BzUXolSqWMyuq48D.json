      "value": "<strong>Shifter Aspect</strong><br/><br/><p>The aspect of the wasp grants flight and a venomous sting, as well as great mental resistance. A giant wasp's alternate attack is sting (P).</p><p><b>Minor Form: </b>You gain a +4 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting affects. This bonus increases to +6 at 8th level and +8 at 15th level.</p><p><b>Major Form (vermin shape II): </b>Your shape changes to that of a giant wasp. This ability uses the vermin shape spell, rather than beast shape, for the purposes of wild shape. While in this form, you gain a fly speed of 40 feet (clumsy), and swarms and vermin do not attack you unless magically commanded to do so. At 8th level, this fly speed increases to 60 feet (average), and you gain a sting attack usable a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier, which applies the following poison.</p><p><i>Wasp Venom </i>(Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC = 10 + half your shifter level + your Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d3 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.</p><p>At 15th level, your fly speed increases to 80 feet (good), and you can attempt to gain control of a mindless swarm as a full-round action. To gain control of the swarm, you must succeed at a Charisma check against a DC of 10 + the swarm's CR. You can direct the swarm to disperse, remain in a designated location, or attack an opponent. This control lasts for a number of rounds equal to half your shifter level.</p><p><b>Alternate Natural Attacks: </b>Sting (P)</p>",
