      "value": "<strong>Shaman Hex</strong><br/><br/><p>The shaman can grow a pair of wings for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. Initially, these wings lack the power to allow the shaman to fly, but the shaman can use them as a secondary natural attack that deals 1d3 points of damage (1d2 for a Small shaman). At 3rd level, she can use the wings to safely descend any distance, as if using the feather fall spell. At 7th level, she can use the wings to fly with poor maneuverability and a fly speed of 30 feet, but the shaman must land at the end of each turn or fall.</p><p>A shaman of 8th level or higher can select the wings hex a second time. This doubles the number of minutes per day the shaman can use her wings (2 minutes per level), and allows her to fly with average maneuverability and a fly speed of 30 feet while the wings are active.</p>",
