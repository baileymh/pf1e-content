      "value": "<strong>Variant Domain Power</strong><br/><br/><p><b>Associated Domain(s): </b>Trickery</p><p>While the church of Asmodeus periodically endorses the use of possession for certain reasons, it is usually vehemently against unsanctioned possession and the creation of uncontrolled undead forces. Asmodeans have a particular hatred for celestials who partake in acts of possession. Such outsiders are hunted down, and the Church of Asmodeus may offer its exorcising agents' services pro bono for the chance to strike at a particularly hated celestial. The eventual consequence of such arrangements-often left unsaid-is that Asmodeans track those they have helped in this way, and often return to force those individuals to host a devil for a period of predetermined length as recompense for their prior service.</p><p><b>Deceptive Reprieve (Sp): </b>When you touch a creature under direct mental control (such as that granted via dominate person, but not via charm person) or the victim of possession, that creature can attempt a new Will save against the control or possession effect with a +2 bonus. If the creature succeeds, the effect or possession is temporarily halted, as per protection from evil, for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your character level. While this ability is active, the target takes a -2 penalty on saves against new mind-affecting effects and new attempts at possession. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p><p>This replaces the copycat domain power of the Trickery domain.</p>",
