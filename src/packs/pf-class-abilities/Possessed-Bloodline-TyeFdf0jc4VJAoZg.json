      "value": "<strong>Sorcerer Bloodline</strong><br/><br/><p>Possessed sorcerers channel their magic potential through a unique bond with a possessing spirit rather than through blood alone. These spirits take numerous forms, but such is their tenaciousness that they bond in a way that prevents their banishment from the host. Instead, both possessor and sorcerer work together, their joint nature allowing the sorcerer to unlock many unnatural abilities. Outsider-rich nations such as Cheliax and the Worldwound are common places for possessed sorcerers to appear, though anyplace where an outsider could possess another living being would be equally suitable. The magical nature of a sorcerer's bloodline means the sorcerer herself does not even need to be the creature initially possessed to have this particular bloodline. It may be that one of your ancestors was possessed by a powerful spirit, one whose presence was so overwhelming that it sends ripples of power down through the generations.</p><p><b>Class Skill: </b>Knowledge (religion)</p><p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>Anticipate perilUM (3rd), share memoryUM (5th), pure spiritOA (7th), entrap spiritOA (9th), possessionOA (11th), telepathyOA (13th), insanity (15th), bilocationOA (17th), divide mindOA (19th).</p><p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>Combat Casting, Deceitful, Fearsome SpellOA, Improved Iron Will, Iron Will, Persuasive, Selective SpellAPG, Skill Focus (Bluff), Spell Focus, Traumatic SpellOA</p><p><b>Bloodline Arcana: </b>Whenever you cast a non-cantrip spell, you can roll the next Will save you attempt against a mind-affecting effect before your next turn twice and take the better result. If you have already failed a save against a mind-affecting effect, you can instead attempt another Will save against that ongoing mind-affecting effect after successfully casting your spell. You can use this ability only once against a given mind-affecting effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p><p><b>Bloodline Powers: </b>The mystical connection with your possessing spirit allows you to gain more control over your body and mind.</p>",
