      "value": "<strong>Wizard Arcane School</strong><br/><br/><p>The void is a complex idea considered by some to be a fifth element-one that comprises thought, space, spiritualism, and insight. Wizards who tap into its mysterious powers gain control over energies that bind the earth to the heavens and the planes to their mysterious and eternal alignments, as well as the powers that stitch living beings to their spirits. The void elemental school presented here is an additional arcane school for the wizard class.</p><p>A wizard who specializes in the void element gains a number of school powers and one bonus spell slot of each level that the wizard can cast, from 1st on up. This bonus spell slot must be used to prepare a spell from the void elemental school's spell list. Unlike a normal arcane school, the void elemental school requires the wizard to select a single element (air, earth, fire, or water) as his opposition school. A wizard must expend two spell slots to prepare a spell from his opposed elemental school as normal. He does not need to select a second opposition school.</p><p>For the sections below, a single asterisk (*) denotes a spell from the RPG Advanced Player's Guide. A double asterisk (**) denotes a spell from Ultimate Magic.</p><h>Void Elementalist Wizard Spells</h><p>0 - guidance</p><p>1st - gravity bow, keen senses, shield, true strike</p><p>2nd - continual flame, haunting mists, invisibility, masterwork transformation, see invisibility, share memory</p><p>3rd - arcane sight, clairaudience/clairvoyance, dispel magic, nondetection, seek thoughts, tapestry's embrace, twilight knife</p><p>4th - minor creation, moonstruck, wandering star motes</p><p>5th - fabricate, major creation, mind fog, telepathic bond, teleport</p><p>6th - dispel magic, greater, legend lore, mage's lucubration, true seeing</p><p>7th - simulacrum, teleport, greater, vision</p><p>8th - mind blank, moment of prescience, orb of the void, whirlwind</p><p>9th - foresight, mage's disjunction, time stop</p>",
