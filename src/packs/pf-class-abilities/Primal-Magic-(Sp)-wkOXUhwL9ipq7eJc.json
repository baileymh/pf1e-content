      "value": "<strong>Arcanist Exploit</strong><br/><br/><p>In seeking to restore formal training in magic to the world, Old-Mage Jatembe also discovered a few methods of creating magic effects that did not follow consistent or logical rules. While his only known remaining notes on these more chaotic forms of magic are closely guarded within the Magaambya, some arcanists have either recreated his theories from vague comments on other topics or independently rediscovered the methods Jatembe first detailed. This 'primal magic' can be accessed one of two ways.</p><p>The arcanist can expend 1 or more points from her arcane reservoir to create an uncontrolled primal effect. This creates an effect from the Sample Primal Magic Events table (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic 13). The CR of this effect is equal to the arcanist's caster level, to a maximum caster level of 5 per point spent from her arcane reserve. In this case, the effect is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to half its CR (maximum spell level 9).</p><p>Alternatively, the arcanist can expend 1 point from her arcane reservoir and expend a spell slot of at least 3rd level to create an effect as if she has used a rod of wonder. Any spell created by the rod of wonder effect uses the arcanist's spell level, rather than the spell level set by the rod of wonder table (for example a fireball created by an 8th level arcanist rolling on the rod of wonder table would deal 8d6, rather than the listed 6d6). In this case, the effect is treated as a spell with a spell level equal to the spell slot expended.</p>",
