      "value": "<strong>Cavalier/Samurai Order</strong><br/><br/><p>Members of this cavalier order serve the cause of legal integrity. Many order of the scales cavaliers track down and apprehend fleeing lawbreakers so that these vagrants may answer for their crimes and make good on their debts. They often serve as judges or stakeholders, and work to ensure that wherever a bargain is made-whether it is monetary, a life debt, or an oath to be upheld-both ends make good on their promises.</p><p><b>Edicts: </b>The cavalier must fulfill all binding agreements he makes with others. If a bargain becomes impossible to fulfill, he must satisfactorily compensate all aggrieved or adversely affected parties involved in the bargain. When serving as a judge or arbiter, the cavalier must make fair, impartial judgments, and if unable to do so, must recuse himself at the earliest possibility. If authorized to enforce an agreement, the cavalier must wholeheartedly strive to accomplish this, remaining unswayed by threats, bribery, and other deterrents.</p><p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever an order of the scales cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on combat maneuvers and attacks of opportunity made against the target of his challenge. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier possesses.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the scales cavalier adds Knowledge (local) (Int) and Linguistics (Int) to his list of class skills. He gains a bonus equal to half his level (minimum +1) on Sense Motive checks to determine whether someone is bluffing and to determine whether a creature's behavior is being inf luenced by an enchantment.</p><p><b>Order Abilities: </b>A cavalier belonging to the order of the scales gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>",
