      "value": "<strong>Unchained Rage Power - Defensive</strong><br/><br/><p>Once per day, the barbarian can absorb the energy from a single attack that deals damage of the energy type she resists with the energy resistance rage power. She takes no damage from the attack and doesn't attempt a saving throw. Instead, she increases the temporary hit points from her rage by an amount equal to 1/2 the damage she would have taken (ignoring her energy resistance). If the barbarian is at least 16th level, once before her rage ends, she can unleash the stored energy as a breath weapon in either a 60-foot line or a 30-foot cone. The breath weapon deals an amount of damage equal to the full amount the barbarian would have taken from the absorbed effect. Creatures affected by the breath weapon can attempt a Reflex save for half damage (DC = 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + her Constitution modifier). She retains the temporary hit points from this ability even if she unleashes this breath weapon. A barbarian must have the energy resistance rage power and be at least 12th level to select this rage power.</p>",
