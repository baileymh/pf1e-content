      "value": "<strong>Shaman Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>A shaman who selects the flame spirit has a radiant light behind her eyes and the faint smell of smoke about her.

A successful Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The shaman can use this ability three times per day, but she must wait 1d4 rounds between each use.</p><p><b>True Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Flame spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Elemental Form (Su): </i>As a standard action, the shaman assumes the form of a Huge (or smaller) fire elemental, as if using elemental body IV with a duration of 1 hour per level. The shaman can use this ability once per day.</p><p><b>Manifestation: </b>Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a spirit of flame. The shaman gains fire resistance 30. She can also apply any one of the following feats to any fire spell she casts without increasing the spell's level or casting time: Enlarge Spell, Extend Spell, Silent Spell, or Still Spell.
