      "value": "<strong>Sorcerer Bloodline</strong><br/><br/><p>The deep forests of Avistan, such as those found in Molthune and Nirmathas, are a haven for one of Golarion's most fabled creatures: unicorns. Deeply empathetic and fiercely protective, unicorns on occasion form close bonds with humans, often young and noble-hearted women. When the two have a particularly strong bond, the unicorn's magic can become a part of the bonded human, and sometimes is even passed on to her children. These children, blessed by their parent's connection to that force of true good, grow up to become sorcerers of the unicorn bloodline.</p><p><b>Class Skill: </b>Heal</p><p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>cure light wounds (3rd), cure moderate wounds (5th), cure serious wounds (7th), neutralize poison (9th), atonement (11th), heal (13th), greater restoration (15th), mass cure critical wounds (17th), mass heal (19th).</p><p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>Alertness, Animal Affinity, Brew Potion, Fleet, Greater Fortitude, Improved Counterspell, Self-Sufficient, Skill Focus (Heal).</p><p><b>Bloodline Arcana: </b>Every time you cast a spell, you can restore a number of hit points equal to double the level of the spell you cast to one target of your choice that you can see. A creature at its maximum hit points cannot be affected by this ability. Healing a dying creature with this ability does not automatically stabilize the creature unless its hit points are brought to 0 or above.</p><p><b>Bloodline Powers: </b>Your connection to the unicorns' blessing shapes you as you grow, empowering you with the forces of good and restoration.</p>",
