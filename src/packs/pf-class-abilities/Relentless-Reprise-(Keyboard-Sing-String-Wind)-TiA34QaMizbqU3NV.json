      "value": "<strong>Bard - Masterpieces</strong><br/><br/><p>Your song replays endlessly in your target's mind, sapping resolve and sanity.</p><p>Prerequisite: Perform (keyboard, sing, string, or wind) 4 ranks.</p><p>Cost: Feat or 2nd-level bard spell known.</p><p>Effect: Whenever you end a bardic performance, you can add a quick reprise that makes it unnaturally catchy. Any creature within 30 feet of you when you finish your performance will run the risk of having your tune replaying endlessly in its mind. Unless the creature succeeds on a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your bard level + your Charisma modifier), the tune distracts it for 1 day per bard level. The creature takes a -4 penalty on concentration checks, initiative checks, and Perception checks as long as it remains distracted. The creature's sleep also becomes fitful, requiring half again as long for the usual benefit and entirely negating the benefits of full bed rest beyond a normal rest. Once per day upon waking after rest, the creature can attempt a new Will saving throw to shake off the relentless reprise. If it fails, the creature takes 1d2 points of Wisdom damage (or 1d4 points of sanity damage if using the sanity rules from Horror Adventures). This is a curse effect with audible components.</p><p>Use: 1 round of bardic performance.</p><p>Action: 1 immediate action.</p>",
