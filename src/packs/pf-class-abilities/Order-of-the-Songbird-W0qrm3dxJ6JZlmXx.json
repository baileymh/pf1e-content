They treat battle as a beautiful art form; many of these samurai seek pacifistic means of defeating their foes.

These samurai are most common in lands where beauty is treasured, such as Hwanggot, Jinin, and Tianjing.</p><p><b>Edicts: </b>The samurai must never destroy art unless doing so is part of an artful act or performance of her own. She must respect the skill of her opponents and never desecrate or purposefully humiliate a foe.
