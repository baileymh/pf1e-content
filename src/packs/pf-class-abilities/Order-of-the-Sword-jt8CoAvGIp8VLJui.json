He must be just and honorable at all times and in all things. He must defend his honor and, above all else, the honor of those he serves.</p><p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever an order of the sword cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target of his challenge so long as he is astride his mount. The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the sword cavalier adds Knowledge (nobility) (Int) and Knowledge (religion) (Int) to his list of class skills. Whenever the cavalier uses Sense Motive to oppose a Bluff check, he receives a competence bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p><p><b>Order Abilities: </b>An order of the sword cavalier receives the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>",
