      "value": "<strong>Cavalier/Samurai Order</strong><br/><br/><p>Only dog- or wolf-riding halflings are eligible to join this order of cavaliers. When they do, they pledge to defend halflings, halfling settlements, and other innocent folks by patrolling the wilderness and seeking out possible threats to both individuals and whole communities. These cavaliers hunt down potential danger with a ruthless efficiency and determination that non-halflings find surprising and even somewhat alarming.</p><p><b>Edicts: </b>The cavalier must strive to protect his community from rampaging monsters and fearsome conquers alike. His first priority is to aid halfling communities, but he also is sworn to protect those who cannot protect themselves from such threats in the wild. He must never take any action that would put a halfling community or an innocent creature in jeopardy. An order of the paw cavalier must take either a wolf or a dog as his mount.</p><p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever an order of the paw cavalier issues a challenge, his mount gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC as long it is threatening the target of the cavalier's challenge and the cavalier is riding the mount. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the paw cavalier adds Knowledge (nature) and Survival to his list of class skills. He can make Knowledge (nature) checks untrained. Also, an order of the paw cavalier is adept at following tracks while mounted, using his mount's speed rather than his own to determine the penalty for tracking while moving, whether he is mounted or not.</p><p><b>Order Abilities: </b>A cavalier belonging to the order of the paw gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>",
