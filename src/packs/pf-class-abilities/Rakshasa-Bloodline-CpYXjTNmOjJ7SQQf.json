Though most of your family seem entirely normal, you have always felt your own skin is a prison from which magic allows you to escape. Your birthright is a secret you may be forced to keep from societies that would never deal with you if your heritage were known.</p><p><b>Class Skill: </b>Disguise.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>charm person (3rd), invisibility (5th), suggestion (7th), detect scrying (9th), prying eyes (11th), mass suggestion (13th), greater polymorph (15th), mind blank (17th), dominate monster (19th).</p><p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>Arcane Armor Mastery, Arcane Armor Training, Deceitful, Detect Expertise, Empower Spell, Light Armor Proficiency, Martial Weapon Proficiency, Stealthy.</p><p><b>Bloodline Arcana: </b>Add half your sorcerer level to the Spellcraft DC for others to identify spells you cast. If their checks fail by 5 or more, they mistakenly believe you are casting an entirely different spell (selected by you when you begin casting).</p><p><b>Bloodline Powers: </b>You can call upon the nearly divine power of your rakshasa ancestors, giving you the power to convincingly deceive your enemies.</p>",
