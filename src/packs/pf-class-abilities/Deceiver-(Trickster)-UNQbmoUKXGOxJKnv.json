      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>The Deceiver is the prince of prevarication.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the Deceiver's favor, you must successfully lie to 100 different sentient creatures, convincing each one of a different lie that somehow leads to its death or other great misfortune. You must then vow to never make a truthful statement, except to answer a question whose answer is clearly already known to the asker (such as the color of the sky), and succeed at a Charisma check.</p><p><b>Spirit Bonus: </b>When you channel the Deceiver, your spirit bonus applies to Charisma checks, Charisma-based skill checks, and Will saves against compulsions and divinations.</p><p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Bordellos, courtrooms, gambling dens, taverns.</p><p><b>Skilled Deceiver (Lesser, Ex): </b>You add 1/2 your medium level (minimum 1) as a bonus on all Bluff checks.</p><p><b>Shift Blame (Greater, Ex): </b>When you provoke an attack of opportunity from a given enemy, you can divert that attack of opportunity to another target of your choice within the attacker's reach. Afterward, the foe whose attack you diverted becomes immune to this ability for 24 hours. When you target a creature with a spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability, or when you fail a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check, you can allow the Deceiver to gain 1 point of influence over you to make the target believe another creature adjacent to you created the effect or attempted to lie to, convince, or bully the target.</p>",
