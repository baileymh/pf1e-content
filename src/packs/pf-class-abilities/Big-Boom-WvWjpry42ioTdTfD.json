      "value": "<strong>Gunslinger Deeds</strong><br/><br/><p>At 7th level, a firebrand can channel her explosive potential into a mighty blast. As a standard action, the firebrand shoots a 30-foot cone of fire from the barrel of her gun. The firebrand designates one creature in the squares affected by the cone to be the target and makes an attack roll with her firearm against that creature; on a hit, the target takes damage as if it were directly hit by both the firebrand's firearm and her bomb. Creatures in all other squares in the cone (as well as the target's square, if the gunslinger's attack missed) take splash damage as if they were in the area of the firebrand's bomb, with a Reflex saving throw for half damage. (The DC of this saving throw is equal to 10 + half the firebrand's gunslinger level + the firebrand's Charisma modifier.) Using this deed costs 2 grit points and expends one of the firebrand's daily uses of bombs (see the bombs ability on page 5), as well as the appropriate ammunition for the firearm attack; ammunition that does not require an attack roll cannot be used this way.</p>",
