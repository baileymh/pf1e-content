      "value": "<strong>Cavalier/Samurai Order</strong><br/><br/><p>Hobgoblins have long taken advantage of the tactical edge darkvision gives them when fighting in darkness, particularly against elves, humans, and samsarans. As the ruling class of Kaoling, hobgoblin samurai have adopted the benefit of darkness as a spiritual alliance that forms a guiding principle in not only how they fight, but every aspect of their lives. This has given rise to the order of the eclipse, a respected samurai order devoted to darkness itself. Although the order is not officially restricted to hobgoblins, its edicts make it difficult for any samurai without darkvision to operate in its ranks.</p><p><b>Edicts: </b>The samurai cannot create light where it is not necessary-anything that can be done in darkness should be. The samurai must belong to a military organization (within Kaoling this is likely to be a warband commanded by a senior samurai, who in turn answers to Warlord Tsung-cha Kavangaki or one of the Council of Nine). The samurai must enforce his place within this order and societies that recognize its authority, obeying those senior to him without question and demanding total obedience from those beneath him. The samurai must take every opportunity to extinguish the lights of his foes.</p><p><b>Challenge: </b>The order of the eclipse samurai gains a +1 bonus on all Intimidate checks made against the target of his challenge. This bonus increases by 1 for every four levels the samurai possesses.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the eclipse samurai adds Perception (Wis) and Survival (Wis) to his list of class skills. In addition, whenever he makes a Perception check to notice an invisible creature or object, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his samurai level (minimum +1).</p><p><b>Order Abilities: </b>A samurai that belongs to the order of the eclipse gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>",
