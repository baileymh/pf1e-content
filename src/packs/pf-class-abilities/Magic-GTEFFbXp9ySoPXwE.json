      "value": "<strong>Warpriest Blessing</strong><br/><br/><p><b>Deities: </b>Asmodeus, Nethys, Urgathoa.</p><p><b>Hand of the Acolyte (minor): </b>At 1st level, you can cause your melee weapon to fly from your grasp and strike an opponent, then instantly return to you. You can make a single attack using a melee weapon at a range of 30 feet. This attack is treated as a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, except that you add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier (you still add your Strength modifier to the damage roll as normal). This ability cannot be used to perform a combat maneuver.</p><p><b>Blessed Magic (major): </b>At 10th level, you can cast a prepared warpriest spell without expending its spell slot. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action and must use a spell slot that is at least 3 spell levels lower than the highest warpriest spell level you can cast. In addition, the spell must be one that damages a creature or causes a creature to take penalties (such as inflict light wounds or bane). For example, if you are 10th level and can cast 4th-level warpriest spells, you could use this blessing to cast a 1st-level warpriest spell without expending its spell slot.</p>",
