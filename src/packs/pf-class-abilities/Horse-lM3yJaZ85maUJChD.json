A horse's alternate attack is hoof (B).</p><p><b>Minor Form: </b>You gain the Endurance feat as well as an enhancement bonus of +5 feet to your base speed. At 8th level, you gain the Run feat. If you already have the Run feat, you instead can run at 6 times your base speed when using the Run feat. At 15th level, your enhancement bonus to your base speed increases to +15.</p><p><b>Major Form (beast shape II): </b>Your shape changes to that of a horse. While in this form, you gain a base speed of 50 feet, low-light vision, scent (30 feet), and the ability to move before and after an attack, as if you had the Ride-By Attack feat. At 8th level, you can move through threatened squares without provoking attacks of opportunity, and you gain trample, as the universal monster rule, dealing your shifter claw damage. At 15th level, you gain Improved Overrun as a bonus feat, even if you do not meet the prerequisites.</p><p><b>Alternate Natural Attacks: </b>Hoof (B)</p>",
