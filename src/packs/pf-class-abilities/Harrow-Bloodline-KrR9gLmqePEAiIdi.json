      "value": "<strong>Sorcerer Bloodline</strong><br/><br/><p>Just as knowledge of the harrow has passed from generation to generation since time immemorial, so too has a deep spiritual connection to the otherworldly forces bound by the harrow passed through the ages. Your family line might trace back to a branch of the ancient Imlios clan (see History of the Harrow on pages 6-7), or one of your ancestors might have once escaped the Harrowed Realm, carrying its inf luence back in his blood. Perhaps you are descended from exceptionally powerful harrowers, and their skill naturally resonates within you. Regardless, your connection to the mysterious deck grants you magical power over the cards of the harrow, visions of the future, and the ability to call down ephemeral forces.</p><p><b>Class Skill: </b>Knowledge (history).</p><p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>ill omen (3rd), augury (5th), harrowing (7th), shadow conjuration (9th), contact other plane (11th), legend lore (13th), greater harrowing (15th), moment of prescience (17th), weird (19th).</p><p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>Alertness, Craft Wondrous Item, Extend Spell, Fortune TellerISWG, HarrowedISWG, Skill Focus (Knowledge [history]), Varisian TattooISWG.</p><p><b>Bloodline Arcana: </b>Whenever you cast a divination spell that requires a percentage roll, add 5 to the result of your roll. In addition, you can roll the percentage dice twice and use the result you prefer. Your maximum percentage chance of receiving a meaningful and accurate reply for divination spells is 100%, instead of the usual 90%.</p><p><b>Bloodline Powers: </b>Your connection to the harrow gives you uncanny insight into both the future and the motivations of mortals.</p>",
