      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>The Ulfen regard the Father of Legends as the greatest skald of all time. During his life, there was no greater honor than to be immortalized by his song, and several of the most famous Ulfen epics were first sung by him.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the Father of Legends' favor, you must first compose a song or poem about a heroic event that you witnessed but did not take part in. Then you must perform the piece in front of a crowd of at least 100 people. If you succeed at a Charisma check during the performance, the Father of Legends will answer your call.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling the Father of Legends, you cannot take any actions that would deny an ally an opportunity for glory. This includes killing an enemy that an ally was attempting to defeat or forcibly removing an ally from combat, even when her life is in danger.</p><p><b>Song of Valor (Intermediate, Su): </b>As a standard action, you can begin a performance that fills allies with power and confidence. Any ally that participated in your seance who can hear your performance receives a morale bonus to Strength and Constitution equal to your spirit bonus. You can maintain this performance for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier plus your spirit bonus. These rounds need not be consecutive. Maintaining your performance is a free action.</p><p><b>Saga of Future Kings (Supreme, Su): </b>Each ally who benefits from your song of valor gains DR/- equal to your spirit bonus. In addition, when an ally affected by your song would be reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, she can attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the damage received). If the ally succeeds, she instead is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>",
