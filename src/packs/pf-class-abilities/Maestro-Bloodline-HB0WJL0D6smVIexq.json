This may be the result of ancient pacts made with azata patrons, or even an inheritance from a lillend or trumpet archon ancestor. It could also be the lingering taint of a less savory heritage, such as from a harpy or a forefather driven to madness by the disquieting gibbering of a shoggoth. However it came to be, your family's artistic bent shows itself strongly in your magic.</p><p><b>Class Skill: </b>Perform.</p><p><b>Bonus Spells: </b>ventriloquism (3rd), hideous laughter (5th), suggestion (7th), shout (9th), dominate person (11th), mass suggestion (13th), power word blind (15th), greater shout (17th), wail of the banshee (19th).</p><p><b>Bonus Feats: </b>Deceitful, Greater Spell Focus (enchantment), Lingering Performance, Persuasive, Skill Focus (Perform), Spell Focus (enchantment), Spellsong, Still Spell.</p><p><b>Bloodline Arcana: </b>Whenever you cast a spell with a verbal component and no somatic or material component, you treat your caster level as if it were one higher.</p><p><b>Bloodline Powers: </b>You hear music whenever you cast spells, and can use the songs in your head to create magic effects.</p>",
