      "value": "<strong>Oracle Curse</strong><br/><br/><p>Your face is deformed, as though you were born with a wolf 's muzzle instead of an ordinary nose and jaw. Many mistake you for a werewolf, and in areas plagued by lycanthropes, you must take pains to hide your face. You have a severe speech impediment, and any spells you cast with a verbal component have a 20% chance of failing, wasting your action but not expending the spell. You gain a natural bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage if you are a Medium creature or 1d3 points of damage if you are Small. At 5th level, you add magic fang to your list of known spells and your bite damage increases to 1d6 if you are Medium or 1d4 if you are Small. At 10th level, the damage dealt by your bite attack increases to 1d8 if you are Medium or 1d6 if you are Small. At 15th level, you add greater magic fang to your list of known spells and the damage dealt by your bite attack increases to 2d6 if you are Medium or 1d8 if you are Small.</p>",
