Cavaliers of this order tend to swear service to a lord or a lady. Of all the orders, the order of the sword is perhaps the broadest in terms of its focus and ideals.</p><p><b>Edicts: </b>The cavalier must show courage in the face of danger, mercy to those who have wronged him, and charity to the poor and the meek. He must be just and honorable at all times and in all things. He must defend his honor and, above all else, the honor of those he serves.</p><p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever an order of the sword cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target of his challenge so long as he is astride his mount. The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the sword cavalier adds Knowledge (nobility) (Int) and Knowledge (religion) (Int) to his list of class skills. Whenever the cavalier uses Sense Motive to oppose a Bluff check, he receives a competence bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p><p><b>Order Abilities: </b>An order of the sword cavalier receives the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>",
