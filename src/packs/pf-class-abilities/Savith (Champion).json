      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>Savith was the Azlanti hero who, during the Age of Legend, descended into the serpentfolk city of Ilmurea and beheaded the evil creatures' god, Ydersius.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain Savith's favor, you must defeat an evil serpentfolk who is at least 1 level higher than yourself. Using a magic weapon, you must decapitate the creature (which requires a successful Strength check) and toss its head into lava or a massive fire while vowing to never retreat from a battle involving evil serpentfolk or worshipers of Ydersius. Savith then answers your call.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Savith, you must never coat any of your natural or manufactured weapons in poison, nor can you ever dose an enemy with any type of poison.</p><p><b>Azlanti Heroics (Lesser, Su): </b>Savith grants a +1 bonus on all attack rolls when you are wielding a greatsword in melee combat against evil monstrous humanoids instead of granting proficiency in an exotic weapon with champion's prowess. For the legendary champion ability, Savith grants any two of the following feats: Disruptive, Greater Weapon Focus (greatsword), Greater Weapon Specialization (greatsword), Weapon Focus (greatsword), Weapon Specialization (greatsword), and Spellbreaker. This ability alters champion's prowess and legendary champion.</p><p><b>Toe to Toe (Intermediate, Sp): </b>When you are in melee combat with a creature that is at least one size category larger than you, if none of your allies are flanking it, you can spend a swift action to increase your own size as if through enlarge person, gaining all the effects of that spell. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the effect lasts as long as you are in melee with that creature or until it is dead.</p>",
