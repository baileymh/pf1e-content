      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>Not all gods of Ninshabur are forgotten. Prophets of the herogod Namzaruum claim he rests in the Hall of Slumbering Kings, but will return to lead the faithful to victory.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain Namzaruum's favor, journey to his ziggurat at the center of Ezida. There, you must swear to help gather the descendants of Ninshabur and to tell all of Namzaruum's inevitable return. You must also succeed at a Charisma check before Namzaruum will answer your call.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Namzaruum, you must take any opportunity to seek out Ninshaburian descendants and proselytize, even if doing so would be disadvantageous.</p><p><b>Phalanx Defense (Lesser, Su): </b>This functions as the marshal's order ability, except if you or an ally who participated in your seance are adjacent to another ally who participated, you and any applicable allies can also add your spirit surge to your CMD against bull rush, drag, overrun, and trip attempts.</p><p>This alters marshal's order.</p><p><b>Slumbering Sword (Greater, Su): </b>When an ally within 30 feet is attacked, you can allow Namzaruum to gain 1 point of influence over you as an immediate action to provide partial cover to that ally for a single attack. The ally must be able to see and hear you for this ability to function. If the attack against your ally misses, your ally can make an attack of opportunity against the enemy who made the attack if that enemy is within your ally's reach. You can use this ability as a standard action to instead grant an ally partial cover for 1 round, but missed attacks against the ally do not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p><p>This replaces decisive strike.</p>",
