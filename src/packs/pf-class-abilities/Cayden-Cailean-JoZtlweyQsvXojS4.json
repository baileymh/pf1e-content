      "value": "<strong>Variant Domain Power</strong><br/><br/><p><b>Associated Domain(s): </b>Chaos</p><p>Cayden Cailean stands opposed to any force that denies free will. Servants of Cayden make unique exorcists, as their methods radically differ from those of other churches, despite often using similar spells and items. Spirited consumption of alcohol usually precedes any formal activity, and while it may seem to onlookers that Caydenites are feckless drunks, the devoted use this time to elicit truthful statements about the possessed from those with whom they drink. In this way, the servants of Cayden ensure they have all the proper information before moving against a supernatural threat, which they undoubtedly do with a (mostly) sober head.</p><p><b>Drunken Autonomy (Su): </b>As a swift action, whenever under the effects of mind-affecting magic, possession, or similar external control, you can channel the unrestricted nature of your god. Instead of acting under the compulsion, you instead act as though you had the confused condition for 1 round. Producing the 'act normally' result allows you to act free of mental compulsion for that round. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.</p><p>This replaces the touch of chaos domain power of the Chaos domain.</p>",
