      "value": "<strong>Bard - Masterpieces</strong><br/><br/><p>Your drumming skills can break solid rock.</p><p>Prerequisite: Perform (percussion) 15 ranks or Perform (wind) 15 ranks.</p><p>Cost: Feat or 5th-level bard spell known.</p><p>Effect: Like a singer shattering a wine glass with a perfect note, your music cracks stone, shivering solid rock until it snaps. When you complete the performance, you create a tremor identical to an earthquake spell.</p><p>For each round you continue to expend bardic performance rounds, the area experiences a round-long aftershock, which has the following effects.</p><p>Caves, Caverns, or Tunnels: Smaller collapses cause 4d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 5 half ) and pin any creatures caught inside.</p><p>Cliffs: More cliffs crumble, creating a landslide that travels half as far horizontally as it falls vertically. Any creature in the path takes 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 5 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble.</p><p>Open Ground: Each creature standing in the area must make a DC 5 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every creature on the ground has a 25% chance of falling into one (Reflex DC 10 to avoid a fissure). The fissures are 20 feet deep, and these fissures remain open at the end of the quake.</p><p>Pinned Beneath Rubble: Any creature pinned by the effects of the aftershock takes 1d3 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a pinned character falls unconscious, she must make a DC 5 Constitution check or take 1d3 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.</p><p>Rivers, Lakes, or Marshes: The area drained away by the earthquake remains drained for the duration of the aftershock.</p><p>Spellcasting: The concentration DC to cast during an aftershock is 15 + the spell's level.</p><p>Structure: Any structure standing on open ground takes 50 points of damage. A collapsing structure deals 4d6 points of bludgeoning damage to creatures inside it (Reflex DC 5 half ), and the creatures inside are pinned beneath the rubble.</p><p>Use: 10 rounds of bardic performance, +1 round for each round of aftershocks.</p><p>Action: 10 full rounds.</p>",
