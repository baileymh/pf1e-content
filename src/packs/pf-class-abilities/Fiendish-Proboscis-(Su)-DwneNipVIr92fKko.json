      "value": "<strong>Arcanist Exploit - Outer</strong><br/><br/><p>The arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir as a standard action to grow a long, articulated proboscis covered with small spiky hairs. The appendage grows from the arcanist's face and houses a highly flexible, muscular tongue tipped with a cartilaginous barbed quill. The proboscis lasts for 1 round per arcanist level, during which time the arcanist cannot speak or use verbal components. The arcanist can end this exploit's effects early as a swift action. As a standard action, the arcanist can attack a target with the proboscis's tongue. This is a primary natural weapon with a 10-foot reach. Attacks with the tongue resolve as a touch attack. If the arcanist uses his tongue and hits a creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities, he drains a portion of the target's magical ability and adds 1 point to his arcane reservoir (points gained in excess of the reservoir's maximum are lost). If the arcanist hits a creature that cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities, the tongue instead drains a portion of the target's life force and heals the arcanist of 1d6 points of damage. Regardless of the target's ability to use magic, the tongue's unnerving siphoning of magical or life energy causes the struck creature to become sickened for 1 round.</p>",
