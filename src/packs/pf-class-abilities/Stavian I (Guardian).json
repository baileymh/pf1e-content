      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>The Bounty Prince was blessed with many advantages: great charm, noble leadership, and adamant will. His stalwart defense of Taldor against the perceived incursions and offenses of the Sarenites-starting with those whose divinations sparked strife between Stavian and his own brothers-showed his resolve for protecting the nation against the might of divine magic in enemy hands. While some have questioned the necessity of the Great Purge, none can argue the effectiveness with which Stavian pursued his enemies. His spirit has since been called by any number of Taldans who oppose the divine, whether fighting worshipers of evil deities or continuing Stavian's crusade against Qadiran Sarenites.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>Stavian tolerates no ambivalence toward or acceptance of an enemy's faith. To gain Stavian's favor, you must destroy an altar or other permanent fixture dedicated to a deity or religion whose followers have wronged you. You must then completely submerge yourself in purifying waters for as long as you can; this requires a Constitution check. If you succeed, Stavian answers your call.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Stavian, you must relentlessly oppose your enemies and never consort with them.</p><p><b>Magical Purge (Intermediate, Su): </b>Stavian grants you protection against the magical power of your enemies. You gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your medium level.</p><p><b>Confiscate Healing (Greater, Su): </b>As an immediate action, when a creature within 30 feet would benefit from magical healing, you can allow Stavian to gain 1 point of influence over you to redirect the benefits of that healing from the original target to yourself.</p>",
