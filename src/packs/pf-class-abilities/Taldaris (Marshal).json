      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>Never since the days of Taldor's founding has there been any leader so capable of unification as the one who brought together the disparate city-states vying for power along the northeastern coast of the Inner Sea. Already legendary when crowned Grand Prince of Oppara, Taldaris nevertheless went on to conquer neighboring territories and found the Principalities of Taldaris, a nascent entity destined to become the greatest empire in the Inner Sea region. Those who seek to channel the spirit of Taldaris must show courage, honor, and integrity, with noble goals of leadership and unification in the face of adversity.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the favor of Taldaris, you must be publicly recognized as the leader of an organization of 50 or more individuals and swear an oath to ensure the cohesion of that group. This requires a Charisma check; if you succeed, Taldaris answers your call.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Taldaris, you must place the interests of the many above your own, and you must not take any actions that would cause you to benefit at the expense of your allies or your allies' collective goals.</p><p><b>Legion Leader (Intermediate, Su): </b>You gain a teamwork feat of your choice for which you meet the prerequisites. All of your allies who joined in the shared seance also gain this feat as a bonus feat, even if they do not meet the prerequisites. You can choose a different feat each time you channel this spirit.</p><p><b>First Emperor's Order (Supreme, Su): </b>You have no limit on the number of times you can use spirit surge in a round, although you can't use it more than once on any d20 roll. When the spirit of Taldaris gains influence over you for using the marshal's order spirit power on an ally's check, further uses of marshal's order before the start of that creature's next turn do not cause the spirit to gain additional influence over you.</p>",
