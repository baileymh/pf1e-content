      "value": "<strong>Kineticist Wild Talent - Utility</strong><br/><br/><p>Element aether; Type utility (Sp); Level 5; Burn 0</p><p>You use strands of aether to animate an object. You can animate a Medium or smaller object as an animated object (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 14) with no Construction Point abilities (except for stone or metal [common], if the object is constructed of one of those materials). Each round on your turn, you must take a move action to guide the object, or it reverts to its inanimate state. By accepting 1 point of burn, you can pour a bit of your own sentience into the aether puppet, allowing the effect to persist for 1 round per kineticist level without requiring additional actions. At 12th level, you can animate a Large or smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Medium animated object plus the additional attack ability. At 14th level, you can animate a Huge or smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Large animated object. At 16th level, you can animate a Gargantuan or smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Huge animated object, as well as the metal (mithral) ability if the object is made of mithral. At 18th level, you can animate a Colossal or smaller object, which gains all the abilities of the Gargantuan animated object, plus the metal (adamantine) ability if the object is made of adamantine.</p>",
