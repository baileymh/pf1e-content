      "value": "<strong>Alchemist Discovery - Crimson Chymist</strong><br/><br/><p>The small barbs that grow on the crimson chymist's arms when she drinks her mantis mutagen grow significantly in size, granting her two claw attacks as natural weapons. These claws deal damage as appropriate for her size (1d4 for Medium crimson chymists) and function as secondary attacks. These claws do not replace the chymist's hands, and she can still use her hands to wield weapons, attack, hold objects, and otherwise use her hands with ease, but she cannot be wearing any item in the wrists slot or any armor-if she dons magic items that occupy the wrists slot or any armor, her claws shrink back to cosmetic barbs that can't be used in combat as long as the armor or wrist items are worn. A crimson chymist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.</p>",
