      "value": "<strong>Cavalier/Samurai Order</strong><br/><br/><p>Cavaliers of the order of the hammer respect might over all, and believe that those who prove their strength have earned the right to make decisions for the weak. When the cavalier's own goals conflict with those of a mighty ruler, the cavalier must prove that her own strength and ideals are superior.</p><p><b>Edicts: </b>The cavalier must continually strive to prove her own strength as well as the strength of those she is allied with, especially when faced with adversity or by those who would seek to best the cavalier's brawn.</p><p><b>Challenge: </b>An order of the hammer cavalier can attempt a free grapple check or free sunder combat maneuver check anytime she takes the full-attack action against the target of her challenge. This free combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the hammer cavalier adds Acrobatics (Dex) and Knowledge (local) (Int) to her list of class skills. In addition, whenever the cavalier uses Acrobatics to jump, she can add her Strength bonus to the check in addition to her Dexterity modifier, and she receives a bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump equal to 1/2 her cavalier level (minimum +1).</p><p><b>Order Abilities: </b>A cavalier belonging to the order of the hammer gains the following abilities as she increases in level.</p>",
