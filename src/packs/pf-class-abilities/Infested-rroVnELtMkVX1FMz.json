      "value": "<strong>Oracle Curse</strong><br/><br/><p>Insects, spiders, grubs, and other vermin plague you constantly. They crawl in your hair, fill your clothes, and f ly or crawl into your mouth, nose, and ears. You take a -4 penalty on Diplomacy checks, and when you first meet someone, the person's initial attitude toward you starts one level lower than normal. Animals shy away from you-you take a -4 penalty on Handle Animal checks. You gain a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves versus poisons from insects, scorpions, and spiders, as well as the distraction ability of swarms of such creatures. At 5th level, you add vomit swarmAPG to your list of spells known. At 7th level, your bonus on poison and distraction saves increases to +4, and you gain DR 10/- against all swarm damage. At 13th level, you add swarm skinAPG to your list of spells known. At 17th level, you become immune to the swarm damage and the distraction ability of insect, scorpion, and spider swarms.</p>",
