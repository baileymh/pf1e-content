In addition, there is a 50% chance that a confirmed critical hit against you is negated, and the damage is rolled normally; this chance doesn't stack with any provided by similar abilities, such as from a suit of armor with the light, medium, or heavy fortification special ability.</p><p><b>Telepathy (Gift, Su): </b>You can mentally communicate with any other creature within 100 feet that has a language. It is possible to telepathically address multiple creatures at once, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time.</p>",
