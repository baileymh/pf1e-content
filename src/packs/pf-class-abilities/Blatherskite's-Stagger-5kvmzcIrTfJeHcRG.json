      "value": "<strong>Gunslinger Deeds</strong><br/><br/><p>At 1st level as an immediate action, when a ranged attack would normally miss a blatherskite, he can allow it to hit him and dramatically stagger a few steps backward, moving up to 10 feet directly away from the attacker. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. The attack deals the minimum amount of damage (as though the attacker had rolled a natural 1 on each damage die).</p><p>At 2nd level, if a ranged attack hits the blatherskite but the attack roll exceeds his AC by no more than his bonus from the nimble class feature, he can spend 1 grit point as an immediate action to take the minimum amount of damage and move up to 10 feet directly away from the attacker. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.</p><p>The gunslinger can perform this deed only while wearing medium or light armor and while carrying no more than a light load.</p>",
