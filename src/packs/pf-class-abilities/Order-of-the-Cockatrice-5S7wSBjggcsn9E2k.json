Cavaliers of this order tend to be selfish and concerned only with personal goals and objectives.</p><p><b>Edicts: </b>The cavalier must keep his own interests and aims above those of all others. He must always accept payment when it is due, rewards when earned, and an even (or greater) share of loot. The cavalier must take every opportunity to increase his own stature, prestige, and power.</p><p><b>Challenge: </b>Whenever an order of the cockatrice cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on all melee damage rolls made against the target of his challenge as long as he is the only creature threatening the target (not counting his mount). This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.</p><p><b>Skills: </b>An order of the cockatrice cavalier adds Appraise (Int) and Perform (Cha) to his list of class skills. In addition, an order of the cockatrice cavalier adds his Charisma modifier to the DC on another creature's attempt to demoralize him through Intimidate (in addition to his Wisdom modifier, as normal).</p><p><b>Order Abilities: </b>A cavalier that belongs to the order of the cockatrice gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>",
