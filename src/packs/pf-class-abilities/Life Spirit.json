      "value": "<strong>Shaman Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>A shaman who selects the life spirit appears more vibrant than most mortals. Her skin seems to glow, and her teeth are a pearly white. When she calls upon one of this spirit's abilities, her eyes and hair shimmer in the light.</p><p><b>Spirit Magic Spells: </b>detect undead (1st), lesser restoration (2nd), neutralize poison (3rd), restoration (4th), breath of life (5th), heal (6th), greater restoration (7th), mass heal (8th), true resurrection (9th)</p><p><b>Hexes: </b>A shaman who chooses the Life spirit can select from the following hexes.</p><p><b>Spirit Animal: </b>The shaman's spirit animal appears to be a beautiful and very healthy version of its species, and seems especially vibrant and full of life. Her animal companion gains fast healing 1 (Bestiary 300); if the spirit animal already has fast healing, instead its fast healing increases by 1.</p><p><b>Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Life spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability.</p><p><i>Channel (Su): </i>The shaman can channel positive energy like a cleric, using her shaman level as her effective cleric level when determining the amount of damage healed (or dealt to undead) and the DC. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma modifier.</p><p><b>Greater Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Life spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the greater version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Healer's Touch (Su): </i>The shaman gains a +4 bonus on Heal checks. As a standard action, the shaman can move up to half her speed and touch up to six dying creatures. Each creature is automatically stabilized without the need of a Heal check.</p><p><b>True Spirit Ability: </b>A shaman who chooses the Life spirit as her spirit or wandering spirit gains the following ability upon having access to the true version of that spirit.</p><p><i>Quick Healing (Su): </i>The shaman calls upon her spirit to enhance the speed of her healing abilities. This ability allows her to channel positive energy or cast a cure spell as a swift action. The shaman can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier.</p><p><b>Manifestation: </b>Upon reaching 20th level, the shaman becomes a perfect channel for life energy. She gains immunity to bleed, death attacks, and negative energy, as well as to the exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, and sickened conditions. Ability damage and drain cannot reduce her to below 1 in any ability score. She automatically succeeds at saving throws against massive damage. When she is reduced to below 0 hit points, she doesn't die until her negative hit point total exceeds double her Constitution score.</p>",
