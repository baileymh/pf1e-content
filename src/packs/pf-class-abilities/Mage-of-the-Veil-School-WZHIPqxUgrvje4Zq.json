      "value": "<strong>Wizard Arcane School</strong><br/><br/><p>The city of Katheer is home to a great number of arcane colleges in the Qadiran tradition. Magic has a proud history in this land; its many schools compete with one another to find the best route to understanding the secrets of power.</p><p>Among these is the focused school of veil magic. Rather than controlling the elements or transforming the environment, mages of the veil focus on much more subtle magic-blending into their surroundings to watch, observe, and gather secrets, or fading from view completely for the sake of solitude. Most graduates of this college enter the service of the satrap as spies, scouts, or infiltrators.</p><p><b>Requirements: </b>A mage of the veil must select disguise self as one of his spells known at 1st level.</p><p><b>Class Skills: </b>A mage of the veil gains Bluff, Disguise, and Stealth as class skills.</p><p><b>Associated School: </b>Illusion.</p><p><b>Replacement Powers: </b>The following school powers replace the blinding ray and invisibility field powers of the illusion school.</p>",
