      "value": "<strong>Swashbuckler 3rd Level Deed</strong><br/><br/><p>Dazing Charm Deed (Ex): A dashing thief takes foes aback with her forwardness, shocking them into submission long enough to rush past or stage a getaway. At 3rd level, as a free action when she successfully feints against a foe, she can spend 1 panache point to pull the enemy into a quick kiss (or similar gesture). The target is dazed for 1 round unless it succeeds at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the dashing thief 's class level + her Charisma modifier). A creature dazed this way is immune to that dashing thief 's dazing charm deed for 24 hours. Whether or not a creature could potentially be affected by a dazing charm deed is ultimately subject to GM adjudication. As a general rule, however, it works on creatures of the dashing thief 's creature type, or on those of a different type but who share significant thematic similarities (for example, a human dashing thief could use her dazing charm deed on any humanoid, but also potentially on creatures as diverse as dryads, tieflings, or even centaurs or sphinxes).</p>",
