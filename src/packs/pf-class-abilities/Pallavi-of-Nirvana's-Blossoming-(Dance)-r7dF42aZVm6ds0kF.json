      "value": "<strong>Bard - Masterpieces</strong><br/><br/><p>The divine sunlight caused by this dance banishes darkness and causes flowers to bloom.</p><p>Prerequisite: Perform (dance) 11 ranks.</p><p>Cost: Feat or 4th-level bard spell known.</p><p>Effect: You begin your dance slowly, focusing on exact posture, the position of your limbs, even the direction of your gaze, then build to a blur of motion. Upon completing the performance, you summon a fixed aura of divine sunlight that glows in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on you.</p><p>The divine sunlight acts as true daylight and affects creatures damaged or destroyed by such light. The light is as bright as sunlight at full noon and counters or dispels any darkness spells of 4th level or lower. If the dance is performed in an area of more powerful magical darkness, both the divine sunlight and darkness are temporarily negated so that otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.</p><p>Within the area of the sunlight, plants grow and blossom rapidly, becoming a overgrown tangle. This effect mimics the overgrowth version of plant growth. You and one ally per three bard levels are immune to the movement-impairing effects of the overgrowth. The divine sunlight and all its associated effects last for 1 minute per bard level you possess.</p><p>Use: 3 bardic performance rounds.</p><p>Action: 3 full rounds.</p>",
