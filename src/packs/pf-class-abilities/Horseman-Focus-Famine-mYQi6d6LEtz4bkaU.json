It also gains Power Attack as a bonus feat.</p><p><b>Aura of Starvation (Su): </b>At 7th level, the grim phantom can create a 10-foot-radius aura of starvation as a swift action. Enemies within the aura take a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Ending the aura is a free action.</p><p><b>Wail of the Hungry (Sp): </b>At 12th level, the grim phantom can cast waves of fatigue once per day as a spell-like ability.</p><p><b>Distended Gullet (Su): </b>At 17th level, as a swift action, the grim phantom in ectoplasmic form gains the swallow whole ability (4d8 negative energy damage, AC 17, one-tenth the phantom's total hit points) for a number of rounds equal to its Charisma modifier. This ability can affect creatures no more than two size categories larger than the phantom. Each creature the grim phantom swallows is shunted into an extradimensional space that can hold any number of creatures. When the duration of this ability ends, any creatures still within the extradimensional space appear adjacent to the grim phantom. The grim phantom is exhausted for 1 hour after using this ability and can't use it again during that time.</p>",
