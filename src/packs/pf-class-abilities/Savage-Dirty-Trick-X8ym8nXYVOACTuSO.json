      "value": "<strong>Rage Power - Offensive</strong><br/><br/><p>Once per round while raging, the barbarian can attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver in place of a melee attack. This attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If successful, the target takes an amount of damage equal to the barbarian's Strength modifier and must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Strength modifier) or take an additional penalty from the dirty trick based on the type of dirty trick performed and the following table.</p><table> <tr>  <td><b>Initial Penalty</b></td>  <td><b>Additional Penalty</b></td> </tr> <tr>  <td>Blinded</td>  <td>Staggered</td> </tr> <tr>  <td>Dazzled</td>  <td>Dazed</td> </tr> <tr>  <td>Deafened</td>  <td>Staggered</td> </tr> <tr>  <td>Entangled</td>  <td>Anchored in place and unable to move from that square</td> </tr> <tr>  <td>Sickened</td>  <td>Nauseated</td> </tr></table><p>On a failed Fortitude save, the opponent takes this additional penalty on top of the dirty trick's original effect. The additional penalty lasts for 1 round (though the initial penalty lasts as long as normal), and can be removed with a move action. The initial effect cannot be removed via mundane means until the additional penalty is removed (though magical effects like remove blindness/deafness work). Removing the initial effect also removes the additional penalty. If the target is immune to the initial penalty, then it is unaffected by the additional penalty.</p><p>For example, a barbarian using this rage power attempts a dirty trick combat maneuver against her opponent to blind him. She succeeds and her opponent fails his Fortitude save, so he becomes staggered as well as blinded. Regardless of whether he had succeeded at his saving throw, the opponent still takes an amount of damage from the barbarian's combat maneuver equal to the barbarian's Strength modifier (unless he has damage reduction or would otherwise be able to prevent this damage). Likewise, if her opponent were immune to blinding effects, he would not suffer from the blindness or the staggering effect, regardless of his saving throw.</p><p>This power can only be used once per opponent per rage. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.</p>",
