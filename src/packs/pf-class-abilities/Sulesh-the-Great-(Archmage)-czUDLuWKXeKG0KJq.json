      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>A powerful genie binder from the Padishah Empire of Kelesh, Sulesh the Great created many famed genie seals, including the artifact known as the Bottle of the Bound, which houses 666 fiends.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain Sulesh's favor, you must travel to the Padishah Empire of Kelesh, or to any place where genie binders exist, and prove your knowledge about all manner of genies. This requires a successful Intelligence check. You must then vow to never release a genie from its bonds, even if you did not bind it. Sulesh the Great then answers your call.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Sulesh, you must not suffer the presence of a rival's summoned creatures and must target them if possible during combat, even if doing so would be disadvantageous to your allies.</p><p><b>Sulesh's Spells (Lesser, Su): </b>Sulesh always grants summon monster I-VI, plus the cantrip detect magic. This ability alters archmage arcana.</p><p><b>Master Summoner (Intermediate, Su): </b>A number of times per day equal to 1/2 your medium level (minimum 1), you can cast any summon monster spell as a standard action instead of a full-round action. Additionally, you can allow Sulesh to gain 1 point of influence over you and expend one of your highest-level spell slots to summon a monster that can be summoned with a summon monster spell 1 level higher than the highest one you can cast. This ability replaces arcane surge.</p>",
