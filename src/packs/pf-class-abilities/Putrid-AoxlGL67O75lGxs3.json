      "value": "<strong>Oracle Curse</strong><br/><br/><p>Your presence stagnates water and befouls all liquids carried on your person, including magical items such as potions, and unattended sources of still water within 10 feet. Creatures who drink such a liquid are nauseated for 1 round (though potions and similar liquids still convey their usual benefits as well). Affected liquids remain stagnant for 1 hour after leaving your presence. Purify food and drink can cleanse a stagnant potion or water with a successful caster level check (DC = 15 + double the potion's caster level). At 5th level, you become immune to the nauseated effects created by liquids your presence has befouled. At 10th level, your body is covered in noxious slime, and each creature adjacent to you at the beginning of its turn must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your oracle level + your Charisma modifier) or become sickened for 1 round. At 15th level, your slime coating grants you DR 10/-.</p>",
