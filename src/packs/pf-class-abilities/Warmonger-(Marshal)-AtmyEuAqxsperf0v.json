      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>The Warmonger is a spirit of unbridled strife, inspiring others to throw their lives away in pursuit of hatred and vengeance.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain the Warmonger's favor, you must intentionally incite a war or blood feud between two groups (which could be nations but don't have to be) that results in at least 36 deaths. You must then swear an oath to never allow quarter or truce or to compromise with those who will not meet your demands, and succeed at a Charisma check.</p><p><b>Favored Locations: </b>Barracks, battlefields, fortresses, throne rooms.</p><p><b>No Mercy (Lesser, Su): </b>You can use spirit surge on your own attack rolls or those of allies within 30 feet who participated in your seance, as long as you have line of sight and line of effect. You can also use your spirit surge when an enemy takes an action that would provoke an attack of opportunity from you or such an ally who threatens that enemy. If you do so, you or an ally of your choice who threatens that enemy can make an attack of opportunity and add your spirit surge, and that attack of opportunity does not count against your normal limit for the round or your ally's. When you use a spirit surge on an attack roll and the attack hits, the spirit surge benefit also applies to the damage roll.</p><p><b>Warmonger's Way (Intermediate, Su): </b>Add the following spells of spell levels you can currently cast to your list of spells known of those levels: 1st-command, murderous commandUM; 2nd-rage, tactical acumenUC; 3rd-confusion, fear; 4th-battlemind linkUM, song of discord. You can also use your spirit surge on concentration and caster level checks when you cast these spells.</p><p><b>Inspiring Call (Greater, Su): </b>You gain the marshal's intermediate spirit power of the same name, but you can activate it as a move action. This improves to a swift action if you have the legendary marshal legendary spirit power.</p>",
