For a number of rounds per day equal to your medium level, you can move normally regardless of magical effects that impede movement, as if you were affected by freedom of movement. In addition, you can cast liberating commandUC as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, using your medium level as the spell's caster level.</p><p><b>Gift of Flight (Gift, Ex): </b>You grow feathery wings as a swift action, which otherwise function as per fly. You can use this ability for a number of minutes each day equal to your medium level. These minutes don't need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments.</p>",
