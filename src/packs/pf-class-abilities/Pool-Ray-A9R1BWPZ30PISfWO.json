      "value": "<strong>Magus Arcana</strong><br/><br/><p>The magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a standard action to infuse a ranged weapon with elemental power. As a free action while making an attack roll with the infused ranged weapon, after the attack roll has been made but before the results are revealed by the GM, the magus can release the charge and cause his attack to deal 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire, chosen when he spends the arcane pool point to activate this ability). If he misses with this attack, the charge is lost and the effect is wasted. If the magus has the ranged spellstrike class feature (such as through the myrmidarch archetype), he can use this ability with ranged spellstrike to treat it as its own ranged touch attack. At 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the amount of damage dealt by this attack increases by 1d6.</p>",
