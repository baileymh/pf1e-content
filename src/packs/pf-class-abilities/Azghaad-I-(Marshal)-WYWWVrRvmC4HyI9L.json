      "value": "<strong>Medium Legendary Spirit</strong><br/><br/><p>The ancient founder of Osirion, Azghaad I brought his people together under Nethys's guidance at the dawn of the Age of Destiny.</p><p><b>Gaining Favor: </b>To gain Azghaad's favor, you must visit Azghaad's Spire in Sothis or any government building or ruin tied to Ancient Osirion. Once there, you must extol the greatness of the early god-kings, swear to support Osirion's return to prominence when possible, and succeed at a Charisma check before Azghaad answers your call.</p><p><b>Taboos: </b>If you accept a taboo while channeling Azghaad, you must embrace any opportunity to spread the legend of past or former Osirian greatness, even if doing so would be disadvantageous.</p><p><b>All-Seeing Eye (Greater, Su): </b>While your eyes aren't literally all-seeing, you can keep track of all your allies with ease. You can shift your senses to any ally who was present for your seance as a move action, as if you had the witness spell (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 249) active on all of them at all times. This replaces decisive strike.</p>",
