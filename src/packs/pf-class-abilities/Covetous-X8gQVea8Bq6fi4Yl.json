      "value": "<strong>Oracle Curse</strong><br/><br/><p>You find yourself drawn to the luster of wealthy living. You must wear fine nonmagical clothing and jewelry worth at least 50 gp + 100 gp per character level you have beyond 1st. If you do not have sufficient wealth to purchase this additional equipment, you feel a strong desire (but are not compelled) to sell existing items or steal from others to obtain it. You are sickened whenever you do not meet this requirement; you are also sickened for 24 hours after anything worth 25 gp x your character level or more is taken from you against your will. Use Magic Device becomes a class skill for you. At 5th level, you gain a +4 insight bonus on Appraise checks, Spellcraft checks to identify magic items, and Use Magic Device checks. At 10th level, you add fabricate to your list of spells known. At 15th level, you add half your oracle level to your CMD against stealAPG combat maneuvers and to the DC of Sleight of Hand checks to take items from you.</p>",
