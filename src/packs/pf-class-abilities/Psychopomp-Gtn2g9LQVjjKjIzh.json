You are always granted a saving throw to negate death spells, magical death effects, and energy drain, even if one is not normally allowed. In addition, as a swift action, you can grant your natural weapons, as well as any weapon you wield, the ghost touch weapon special ability for a number of rounds equal to your medium level. These rounds don't need to be consecutive.</p><p><b>Spiritsense (Gift, Su): </b>You can notice, locate, and distinguish between living and undead creatures within 30 feet, just as if you had the psychopomp's spiritsense ability.</p>",
