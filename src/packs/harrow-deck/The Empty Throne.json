  "content": "<p><strong>The Empty Throne</strong> (lawful good, Charisma) has a sense of loss that is palpable. The ghost signifies that those who are gone will always be with us. They taught us important lessons, if only we choose to listen. This card can bring information from a far-off or ancient source. If The Empty Throne is misaligned, the ghosts of the past are restless, and might require effort to set at peace.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/Harrow%20Deck/The%20Empty%20Throne.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"494\" /></p>\n<p> </p>",
