The prophet is the audience and the prophecy is the show. She has no influence on what she sees, and its importance is often not recognized until too late. If The Theater is misaligned, the prophecy is just for show.</p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/Harrow%20Deck/The%20Theater.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"494\" /></p>",
