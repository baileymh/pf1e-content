  "content": "<p><strong>The Rabbit Prince</strong> (chaotic neutral, Dexterity) is a quirky fellow who represents the vagaries of hand to hand combat. The Prince is battle personified and nothing if not capricious. As his broken sword symbolizes, any combatant can fall in battle, no matter how brave or skilled. This card sometimes stands for younger members of royalty or other powerful households.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/Harrow%20Deck/The%20Rabbit%20Prince.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"494\" /></p>\n<p> </p>",
