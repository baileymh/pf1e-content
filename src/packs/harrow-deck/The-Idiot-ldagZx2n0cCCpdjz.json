The goblins have captured a foolhardy man, representing the knowledge that loss of dignity can precede loss of life. Misaligned, this card might indicate feigning of idiocy to disguise one's gifts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/Harrow%20Deck/The%20Idiot.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"494\" /></p>\n<p> </p>",
