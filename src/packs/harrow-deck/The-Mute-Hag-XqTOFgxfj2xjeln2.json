This hag invokes blood pacts and poisonous secrets, the kind that turn brother against brother and son against father. It is a card that performers loathe, as it leaves them stumbling over their words and songs. Misaligned, it indicates unshakable loyalty and lucidity of speech.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/Harrow%20Deck/The%20Midwife.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"494\" /></p>\n<p> </p>",
