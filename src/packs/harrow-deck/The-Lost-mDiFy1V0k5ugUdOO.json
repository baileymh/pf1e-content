  "content": "<p><strong>The Lost</strong> (chaotic evil, Wisdom) is the card of emptiness and loss of identity. The bodak shown is forever mad, lost in a world of lunatics, insane asylums, and mass killers. For those under its influence, the world makes no sense. It evokes times where all is babble, as when meeting someone who speaks only in another tongue. Misaligned, The Lost can indicate clarity of mind under duress.</p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/Harrow%20Deck/The%20Lost.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"494\" /></p>",
