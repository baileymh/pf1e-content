This disaster does not come in the course of natural order but is one that comes from the plots of intelligent beings. The Cyclone signifies war, arson, or other events that destroy everything they touch. Misaligned, this card can indicate renewal after a blustery trial.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/Harrow%20Deck/The%20Cyclone.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"494\" /></p>\n<p> </p>",
