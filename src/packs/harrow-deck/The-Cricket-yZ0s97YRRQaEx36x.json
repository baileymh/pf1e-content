Although The Cricket is commonly associated with travel, the peach it sits by represents treasure at the end. If The Cricket is misaligned, the journey will go poorly, and the treasure will be one that is lost rather than found.</p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/Harrow%20Deck/The%20Cricket.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"494\" /></p>",
