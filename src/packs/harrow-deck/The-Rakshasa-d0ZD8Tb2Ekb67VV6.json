The creature sitting serenely upon the slave's back indicates an exterior force imposing itself upon another being's mind. On occasion, the slavery is literal, but more often it is mental enslavement. Misaligned, this card means that the enslavement can be cast off in the face of new information.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/Harrow%20Deck/The%20Rakshasa.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"494\" /></p>\n<p> </p>",
