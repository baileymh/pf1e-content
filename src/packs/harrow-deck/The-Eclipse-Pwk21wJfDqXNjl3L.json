This card afflicts those with faith in the divine, as their talents can wane under this stress. It can also indicate a loss of way along a path. If misaligned, it can augur an unheralded ability coming to the fore or a concealed location revealed.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/Harrow%20Deck/The%20Eclipse.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"494\" /></p>\n<p> </p>",
