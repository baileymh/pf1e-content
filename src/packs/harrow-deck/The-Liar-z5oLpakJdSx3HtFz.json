This is not the love that moves mountains - this is the love that rips the heart in two and causes lovers to leap to their deaths. This lamia can mean obsession, unrequited passion, or doomed love. Misaligned, the card can indicate a new relationship beginning, although disguised as something much less beautiful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/Harrow%20Deck/The%20Liar.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"494\" /></p>",
