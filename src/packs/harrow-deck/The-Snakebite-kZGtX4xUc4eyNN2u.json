The poison on the assassin's blade represents the death of ideas and freedom, as well as the ability to turn friends against each other or poison the minds of the virtuous. Misaligned, this card can mean a mental leap, a new friendship, or a discovery.</p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/Harrow%20Deck/The%20Snakebite.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"494\" /></p>\n<p>Â </p>",
