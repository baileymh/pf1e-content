Approach each card as a unique individual. No one gives their secrets to someone they don't trust. Be sure the cards trust you.</em></p>\n<p>- Riana, Varisian harrower</p>\n<h1>Interpreting the Cards</h1>\n<p>Each card in the Harrow deck has its own general meaning. These meanings are influenced by circumstances, and giving a true reading of the cards is something only a skilled harrower can accomplish. Yet even those with only basic knowledge of the Harrow deck can glean some information from it.</p>\n<p>Cards in a choosing are interpreted by their most basic meaning. However, cards in a spread can have their meaning modified based on their placements in the spread. Good and evil cards have different meanings when they are in misaligned placements (a good card appearing on the bottom row of the spread or an evil card appearing on the top row). Cards that are neither good nor evil are never treated as misaligned, as they don't take a side in the struggle between good and evil.</p>\n<p>The following pages contain brief synopses of the meanings of each card in the Harrow deck.</p>",
