If you cast harrowing on another, you must remain adjacent to the target for the casting time. A harrowing must describe one set of events or course of action that the target of the spell intends to undertake during the spell's duration.</p>\n<p>Draw nine cards from the Harrow deck when this spell is cast. Record the ability score and alignment associated with each card. Each of these cards grants a luck bonus or a penalty on a specific type of d20 check; the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card's alignment matches the target creature's alignment. If the card's and target's alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit's check. If the card's and target's alignments are in opposition (see below), the card inflicts a -1 penalty on that associated check. If the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit's check. While penalties persist on all associated checks for as long as the <strong>harrowing</strong> persists, the bonuses are one-use bonuses that the harrowed character can spend at any time to modify an associated check. You can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll. Bonuses granted are luck bonuses and do not stack, while penalties do stack. Once you spend all of the bonuses granted by a <strong>harrowing</strong>, or once the spell's duration ends, the spell ends and the penalties are removed. A single creature can only be under the effects of one harrowing at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Associated Suit Checks</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Suit</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Associated Check</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hammer (Str)</td>\n<td>Attack rolls (ranged and melee)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Key (Dex)</td>\n<td>Reflex saving throws</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shield (Con)</td>\n<td>Fortitude saving throws</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Book (Int)</td>\n<td>Skill checks</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Star (Wis)</td>\n<td>Will saving throws</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crown (Cha)</td>\n<td>Any d20 roll</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Opposition Alignments</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Alignment</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Opposition</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LG</td>\n<td>CE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NG</td>\n<td>NE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CG</td>\n<td>LE</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LN</td>\n<td>CN</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>N</td>\n<td>LG, LE, CG, or CE (pick one when spell is cast)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CN</td>\n<td>LN</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LE</td>\n<td>CG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NE</td>\n<td>LG</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>CE</td>\n<td>LG</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
