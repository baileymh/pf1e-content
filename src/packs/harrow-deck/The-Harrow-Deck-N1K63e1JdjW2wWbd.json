My cards know where you've been and where you're going. And it's not pretty. Not at all. So, walk away. Or stop and learn to turn the few remaining pages of the story of your life into a novel worth the telling. Or don't. After all, they're only cards.</em></p>\n<p><em>- Riana, Varisian harrower</em></p>\n<h1>The Harrow Deck</h1>\n<p>Harrow is a tarot-like deck usable in everyday life or in any roleplaying game. Regardless of where you use it, use it with care. A Harrow deck is loaded with power, so you must learn to read the cards correctly or else suffer an ignominious fate.</p>\n<p>In these pages, you will learn to perform a harrowing, which is a reading of the cards in such a way that you wrest information out of someone's life. It's a difficult process for your subject, as his entire past, present, and future is laid bare. Sometimes, the deck talks of good tidings, sometimes of ill. Rarely is it wrong.</p>\n<p>The most important thing is to treat your Harrow deck with respect. Disrespect the deck, and the deck will disrespect you. That way surely lies ruin. You don't want ruin. You want to know how to read these cards.</p>",
