  "content": "<p>A Harrow deck contains 54 cards. Each card has one of six symbols corresponding to six abilities, and the symbol is located in one of nine positions corresponding to nine alignments.</p>\n<p>The Paladin, for example, has a hammer (the symbol for Strength) in the upper left corner (the position for lawful good), so it's the lawful good Strength card. Similarly, The Liar has a crown (Charisma) in the lower right corner (chaotic evil), so it's the chaotic evil Charisma card.</p>\n<p>The following pages detail how to conduct a Harrow reading, explaining the general meaning of each card and details of its placement. These factors all influence a prediction, but it's up to a Harrow reader to tie together the cards' suggestions with their characters' story. Interpretations are often vague and metaphorical, and harrowers shouldn't feel obligated to craft specific meanings into their interpretations of the cards - vagaries and multiple interpretations are all part of a harrower's mystical art. Ultimately, the purpose of the Harrow deck is to help facilitate a mystical encounter, not to force the harrower to accurately read a specific message from a pattern of cards. So long as the reader can use the deck as a springboard to making broad predictions, destiny and other players' interpretations will fill in the gaps.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/Harrow%20Deck/Legend.webp\" width=\"317\" height=\"515\" /></p>\n<p> </p>",
