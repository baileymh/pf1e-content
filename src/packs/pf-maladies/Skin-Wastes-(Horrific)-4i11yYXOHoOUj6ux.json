At this stage, the disease has no mechanical effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Early&nbsp;</strong>The affected creature&rsquo;s skin becomes gray and flaky. The itchiness caused by the disease worsens, and the creature must succeed at a Will save at the disease&rsquo;s DC each waking hour or frantically spend much of that hour scratching away at its skin. For each failed Will save after the first in the same day, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage, as its scratching begins to break the skin and leave bloody gouges.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate&nbsp;</strong>The itching intensifies, and the amount of damage dealt by scratching increases to 1d8. Additionally, during combat and other stressful situations, the affected creature must scratch its skin each round as a move action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Each round, the affected creature can suppress the need to scratch that round with a successful Will save at the disease&rsquo;s DC, but if it attempts the saving throw and fails, it spends the entire round scratching.</p>\n<p><strong>Severe&nbsp;</strong>The affected creature&rsquo;s skin becomes cracked and broken, and even moving is incredibly painful. As long as the creature remains at this stage, the affected creature is&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; background-image: none; background-color: initial; padding: 0px; color: #ff6400; border: none;\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"pf1.conditions\" data-id=\"0AJZKIpP3lS3FVKa\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; text-decoration-line: underline;\">sickened</span></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; background-image: none; background-color: initial; padding: 0px; color: #ff6400; border: none;\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"pf1.conditions\" data-id=\"6LpiJdKskDFD4zLC\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; text-decoration-line: underline;\">staggered</span></a>.

For the first 24 hours at this stage, its Dexterity score is reduced by 1 each hour. During this time, its skin and organs transform into a single, solid mass of bone. Once its Dexterity score reaches 0 or after 24 hours have passed, it is&nbsp;<a class=\"entity-link\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; background-image: none; background-color: initial; padding: 0px; color: #ff6400; border: none;\" draggable=\"false\" data-pack=\"pf1.conditions\" data-id=\"qLQsdbMorUOjOJWJ\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; text-decoration-line: underline;\">petrified</span></a>.
