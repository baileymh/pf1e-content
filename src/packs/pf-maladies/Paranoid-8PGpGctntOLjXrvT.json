Lastly, any time the afflicted character tries to use or gain a benefit from the aid another action, or is the target of a beneficial spell or effect from an ally, he must succeed at a Will saving throw in order to take the aid another action or gain the benefit from the action, spell, or effect.</p><p><strong>Dormancy Effect</strong> The afflicted character gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against charm effects, but takes a -2 penalty on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive checks.</p><p><h3 class=\"framing\">Description</h3>A paranoid character is convinced that the world and society are conspiring toward his ruin.
