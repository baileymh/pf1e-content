      "value": "<p><em>You know how to take a hit, even if your reaction sends you bouncing and flying out of battle while shrieking at the top of your lungs.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />Goblin, Acrobatics 1 rank.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />If you are struck by a melee weapon you can try to convert some or all of that damage into movement that sends you off in an uncontrolled bouncing roll. To do so, you must make an Acrobatics check (DC = 5 + the damage dealt from the attack) as an immediate action. If you succeed in this check, you take no damage from the actual attack but instead convert that damage into movement with each point equating to 1 foot of movement. For example, if you would have taken 6 points of damage, you would convert that into 6 feet of movement. You immediately move in a straight line in a direction of your choice this number of feet (rounded up to the nearest 5-foot-square), halting if you reach a distance equal to your actual speed. If this movement would make you strike an object or creature of your size or larger, the movement immediately ends, you take 1d4 points of damage, and fall prone in that square. This involuntary movement provokes attacks of opportunity normally if you move through threatened squares, but does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature that struck you in the first place.<br /><br />You are staggered for 1 round after you attempt to use this feat, whether or not you succeed.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Pathfinder Society<br /></strong>Only legal goblin PCs are allowed to choose anything from this book</p>",
