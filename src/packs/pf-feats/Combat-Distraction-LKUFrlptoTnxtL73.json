      "value": "<p><em>Anyone who attacks you while you act like a lunatic exposes themselves to brutal counterattacks from your allies.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />Goblin, Acrobatics 1 rank, Escape Artist 1 rank.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />As a full-round action, you can choose to do something that seems to serve no useful purpose. Example actions could include laughing at another creature's misfortune, rooting in your pockets for a snack, bending over to pick up what looks like a weird bug, or trying to fly into the air by flapping your arms like a sea gull.Although you're acting like a lunatic, your unpredictable actions are distracting. Any creature other than a goblin within 5 feet of you takes a -2 penalty on Perception checks and concentration checks for as long as you continue to be a distraction and remain in range. This penalty stacks with other goblins performing combat distractions, as long as you're both adjacent to the distracted target.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Pathfinder Society<br /></strong>Only legal goblin PCs are allowed to choose anything from this book</p>",
