      "value": "<em>The goddess of lust, revenge, and trickery has granted you a living sting to show her favor in you.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Chaotic neutral alignment, worshiper of Calistria.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>You gain a familiar as per the arcane bond class feature, using your character level as your wizard level. The familiar is a cat-sized, chaotic neutral wasp loyal to you. Use the statistics for a greensting scorpion familiar (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 188), but give it a base speed of 10 feet, a fly speed of 40 feet (average), no Climb bonus, and Fly +7. If you have the ability to gain a familiar through other means (such as the arcane bond class feature), and you are at least 5th level, instead use the statistics for an imp, but replace the invisibility spell-like ability with an unnatural lust (DC 14) spell-like ability usable three times per day. You can have only one familiar.<br/><br/> If you ever grossly violate the code of conduct required by Calistria (a violation of the scale that would cause a cleric of Calistria to lose all spells and class features), your familiar turns on you and attacks you until it is killed. To regain a familiar, you must atone for your deeds with the atonement spell, and pay to have the slain familiar raised from the dead. If your familiar is slain or lost through other means, you can replace it using the normal rules for replacing familiars.<br/><br/><b>Special</b><br/>This feat can be taken a second time by characters of 7th or higher level if they do not otherwise have access to familiars. Such characters have access to a wasp familiar that uses the statistics for an imp, as described above.",
