If you also have the Leadership feat, increase your Leadership score by 3 for the purpose of determining how many followers you have.<br/><br/><b>Goal</b><br/> Thwart all rivals to rulership over the chosen region, including at least one challenging foe.<br/><br/><b>Completion Benefit</b><br/>You gain control of the settlement (see the settlement rules in the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide). Upon gaining this benefit and once per year thereafter, you can attempt to alter the settlement in one of the following ways by attempting a DC 25 Diplomacy check modified by the settlement's Society modifier or a DC 25 Intimidate check modified by its Law modifier: <ul><li>Move the settlement's alignment 1 step closer to yours along either the good-evil or law-chaos axis. </li><li>Replace one settlement quality with another. </li><li>Change the government type. </li><li>Significantly alter the laws.</li></ul> Failure indicates that popular opinion in the city successfully opposes you.<br/> In addition, from now on, your followers gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws as long as they can see you.",
