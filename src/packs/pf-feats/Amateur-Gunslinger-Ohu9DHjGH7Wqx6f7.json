      "value": "<em>Although you are not a gunslinger, you have and can use grit.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>You have no levels in a class that has the grit class feature.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>You gain a small amount of grit and the ability to perform a single 1st-level deed from the gunslinger deed class feature. At the start of the day, you gain 1 grit point, though throughout the day you can gain grit points up to a maximum of your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can regain grit using the rules for the gunslinger's grit class feature (see page 9). You can spend this grit to perform the 1st-level deed you chose upon taking this feat, and any other deed you have gained through feats or magic items.<br/><br/><b>Special</b><br/>If you gain levels in a class that grants the grit class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the Extra Grit feat.<br/><br/><b>Combat Trick</b><br/>Choose a second 1st-level gunslinger deed. You can spend grit to use this deed, or you can spend 5 stamina points to use either of your deeds in place of grit. If you gain levels in a class that grants the grit class feature, you retain the ability to spend 5 stamina points in place of grit when using any of your 1st-level deeds, and this becomes a combat trick of the Extra Grit feat (even though that feat is not a combat feat).",
