      "value": "<p><em>You would destroy the world if it were within your power.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />10 Hit Dice, chaotic evil alignment.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />You can store a number of affirmations up to your Charisma bonus (minimum 1) to use at any time, not just within the next 24 hours. You can also use an affirmation to treat an effect on you from a spell, magic item, or other alignment-based effect as if you were neither chaotic nor evil. You can choose to do so after any attack roll hits you with such an effect or you fail a saving throw against such an effect. Lastly, you gain a +2 bonus on weapon and spell damage rolls against lawful and good creatures (or +4 if the creature is both lawful and good). This is an alignment-based effect.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Residual</strong><br />If you have this feat but you are no longer chaotic evil, you continue to gain the +2 bonus on weapon and spell damage rolls against lawful and good creatures (or +4 if the creature is both lawful and good).</p>",
