      "value": "<em>You can create an ensemble of skilled and amateur performers to aid you in your performance.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Perform 5 ranks<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>When you are performing, allies within 20 feet who also have this feat can aid you with your Perform checks (including those made as part of bardic performance) as if they were aiding another as an immediate action. The allies make their aid another rolls before you make your check. No more than four allies can grant you a bonus with aid another. Allies aiding you do not need to use the same category of the Perform skill that you are using in order to aid you.<br/><br/><b>Special</b><br/>If you possess one or more levels of the bard class, you can choose any one ally within 20 feet to be part of the ensemble. The ally is considered to have the ensemble teamwork feat for the purposes of aiding your performance.",
