      "value": "<em>Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, heavy) or a single type of one-handed or two-handed firearm that you are proficient with. You can reload such a weapon quickly.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen) or Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearm).<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>The time required for you to reload your chosen type of weapon is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow), a move action (for heavy crossbow or one-handed firearm), or a standard action (two-handed firearm). Reloading a crossbow or firearm still provokes attacks of opportunity. <br/><br/> If you have selected this feat for a hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full-attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.<br/><br/><b>Normal</b><br/>A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, a standard action to reload a one-handed firearm, or a full-round action to load a heavy crossbow or a two-handed firearm.<br/><br/><b>Special</b><br/>You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow or a new type of firearm.<br/><br/><b>Combat Trick</b><br/>When reloading a crossbow or firearm, you can spend 5 stamina points to reduce the reload time by one step; a standard action becomes a move action, a move action becomes a swift action, and a swift action becomes a free action. The weapon you are reloading doesn't need to be the one you chose when you took this feat. If the weapon already has a reload time of one free action, when you make a full attack with the weapon, you can spend 2 stamina points to gain a +1 bonus on all damage rolls with the weapon during that full attack.",
