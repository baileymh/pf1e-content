      "value": "<em>The deaths of living, sentient creatures fuel your spells and heighten their potency.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks, Knowledge (planes) 4 ranks, Knowledge (religion) 4 ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks, ability to cast 3rd-level spells, evil alignment.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>By partaking in a heinous ritual that takes at least 10 minutes to complete and which requires you to perform a successful coup de grace upon a sacrifice, you can enhance the power of a single spell you know or have prepared for the next 24 hours, regardless of how many times you cast it within that period. Your sacrifice must be a sentient creature with a total number of Hit Dice greater than or equal to your caster level, and it must die from your coup de grace; if it doesn't die or comes back to life, you lose all benefits related to that sacrifice.<br/><br/> After successfully performing the ritual, you choose the spell that the ritual enhances and gain your choice of a +2 bonus to any attack rolls and combat maneuvers made with that spell or a +2 bonus on caster level checks to overcome spell resistance with that spell for 24 hours.<br/><br/> You can perform this ritual a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, but you cannot affect the same spell more than once at a time.",
