      "value": "<em>You physically defile yourself, others, or holy objects in order to prove your blasphemous devotion to a demon lord and gain special boons.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>3 ranks in Knowledge (planes), must worship a demon lord.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>Each demon lord requires a different obedience, but all obediences take only an hour to perform. Once the obedience has been performed, you gain the benefit of a resistance to some element or attack associated with your demon lord, as indicated in the 'Obedience' entry for the demon lord.<br/><br/>If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by your demon lord upon undertaking your obedience. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the demon lord's second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the demon lord's third and final boon. Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is listed, a boon's effects are constant.<br/><br/>Demoniacs (see page 46) gain access to these boons at lower levels as a benefit of their prestige class.<br/><br/>If you ever fail to perform a daily obedience, you lose all access to resistances and boons granted by this feat until you next perform the obedience.",
