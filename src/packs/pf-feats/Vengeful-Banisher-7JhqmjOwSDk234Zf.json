      "value": "<em>You've witnessed demons and their madness firsthand, likely in one of the lands detailed in this section, or perhaps some other demon-marked region such as the Worldwound or the Abyss. Since then, you've sworn to send these wretched fiends back to whence they came, and you've become an expert at rooting out their kind and their servants.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>You witnessed at least one family member or a close friend being killed by demons or demonic cultists, or you have the Hated Foe or An Eye for an Eye background (see Ultimate Campaign).<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells or effects originating from demon worshipers and from creatures of the demon type.<br/><br/><b>Goal</b><br/> Convince the leader of a demon cult to renounce her Abyssal lord and seek atonement for her actions. Alternatively, if you kill the cult leader, you must also decisively defeat at least half of the cultists and have the cult's base of operations consecrated by a well-known local priest.<br/><br/><b>Completion Benefit</b><br/>When a demon damages you with an attack, spell, spell-like ability, or special ability and reduces you to fewer than 0 hit points, you may allow righteous energy to pour through you and into the demon, instantly sending it to another plane of existence (as dismissal) if it fails a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your Hit Dice + your Charisma modifier). This dismissal takes place after you are damaged but before you fall unconscious, so you can use this ability even if the demon kills you. You can use this ability once per day. Once you have used this ability, you must be healed to your maximum number of hit points before you can use the ability again.",
