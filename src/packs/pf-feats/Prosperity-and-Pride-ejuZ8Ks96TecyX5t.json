      "value": "<em>Your family has raised cities and mastered trade, and you seek to do the same.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Be a member of House Corcina, or have the Craftsperson, Inheritance, Well-Connected Friend, or Worldshaker background.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>When in a settlement the size of a large city or smaller, you receive a +2 bonus on Appraise checks and Diplomacy checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus on that skill increases to +4.<br/><br/><b>Goal</b><br/> Your actions must spur a settlement to grow to the next size category; this usually involves decisively defeating a challenging foe or an appropriate number of foes preying upon or impeding the settlement's citizenry.<br/><br/><b>Completion Benefit</b><br/>You teach others how to get the most out of their equipment. Three times per day as a standard action, you can increase the armor bonus provided by a suit of nonmagical armor, the circumstance bonus to a skill provided by a tool or skill kit, or the shield bonus provided by a nonmagical shield by 1. This bonus lasts for 1 hour and doesn't stack with other uses of this ability.",
