      "value": "<em>With a well-aimed strike, you cause your target to become fatigued or exhausted.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Dex 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). Draining Strike forces a foe that was damaged by your unarmed attack to attempt a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally. A defender who fails this saving throw is fatigued for 1 minute or until the foe is subject to any spell or effect that heals hit point damage. If you have a base attack bonus of +14 or higher, the target is exhausted for the same duration instead. You can attempt to use Draining Strike once per day for every 4 character levels you have, but you can use it no more than once per round. Constructs, incorporeal creatures, plants, undead, and creatures that are immune to critical hits cannot be affected by this ability.<br/><br/><b>Combat Trick</b><br/>You can spend 5 stamina points to declare that you are using Draining Strike after you've hit with an unarmed strike attack.",
