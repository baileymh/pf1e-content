      "value": "<em>Others whisper that you're little more than a golem obeying orders. They're wrong, but your dedication is clear.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Improved Iron Will, Iron Will, base attack bonus +8.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>When you fail a Will save against a mind-affecting effect that would cause you to lose control of your actions (such as dominate person or hideous laughter), you can instead opt to follow a rudimentary programming. For a number of rounds equal to half your level (minimum 1) you gain the staggered condition and must either attack a designated target within 60 feet or hold position. If you hold position, you take the total defense action instead of taking whatever action the mind-affecting effect would force you to take. If you choose to attack a target, you must either make a ranged attack, make a melee attack, or move closer to the designated target. If the mind-affecting effect has not been resolved by the time the effects of this feat end, then you are subject to the effect as normal.",
