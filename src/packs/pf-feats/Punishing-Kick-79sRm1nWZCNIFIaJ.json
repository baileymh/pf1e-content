      "value": "<em>Your kicks are so powerful you use them to push or knock back your foes.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Con 13, Wis 13, Improved Unarmed Strike, base attack bonus +8.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). On a successful hit, the attack deals damage normally and you can choose to push your target 5 feet or attempt to knock them prone. If you decide to push the target, it is moved 5 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. If you decide to attempt to knock the target prone, the target receives a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier to avoid the effect. You may attempt a punishing kick attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.<br/><br/><b>Special</b><br/>A hungry ghost monk receives Punishing Kick as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt a punishing kick attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.<br/><br/><b>Combat Trick</b><br/>You can spend 5 stamina points to declare you are using this feat after you make a successful unarmed strike attack.",
