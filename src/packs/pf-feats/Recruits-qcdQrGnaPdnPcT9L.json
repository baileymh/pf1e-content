      "value": "<em>Be they students, retainers, new recruits to your order, or neophyte members of your faith, you have access to a small set of dedicated servants.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Cha 13, character level 5th.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>You gain a number of cohorts (as per the Leadership feat) that represent NPCs you are responsible for instructing and overseeing. You have a number of such cohorts equal to half your character level. Unlike normal cohorts, these recruits must be at least 4 levels lower than your level. Since these recruits must spend most of their time studying and gaining experience, only one recruit can travel with you at a time (though they all gain experience at the same rate, as those not present are assumed to be studying and growing independently). Whenever you are in a major town or city, you can exchange the recruit currently accompanying you for a different member of your recruits.<br/><br/>As recruits are busy learning and studying the basics of their careers, those not traveling with you cant engage in mundane or magical crafting or Profession checks. Recruits not traveling with you can, however, serve as managers for your holdings if you are using the downtime rules. If a recruit dies, you take only a 1 penalty to your Leadership score.<br/><br/><b>Special</b><br/>The Recruits feat counts as the Leadership feat for purposes of fulfilling prerequisites. A character cannot have both Leadership and Recruits. A character with Recruits who later qualifies for Leadership can exchange this feat for Leadership immediately upon qualifying (selecting one minor cohort to become a full cohort, while the rest move on).",
