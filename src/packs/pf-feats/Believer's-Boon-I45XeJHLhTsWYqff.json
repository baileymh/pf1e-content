      "value": "<p><em>Your deity rewards you for your faithfulness.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />Wis 13, alignment must be within one step of your deity's.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />When you take this feat, choose one domain granted by your deity. You can use the 1st-level domain ability that clerics of that domain can use a number of times or rounds per day, but you can use it only once per day or 1 round per day, whichever is appropriate. Your effective cleric level in regard to this ability is 1st level. If the domain has a 1st-level ability that does not meet this specification, you cannot use it.<br /><br /><strong>Special</strong><br />You can take this feat twice. When you take it a second time, you choose another domain granted by your deity.<br /><br />If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deity's, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the atonement spell on page 245 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</p>",
