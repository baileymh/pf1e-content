      "value": "<em>Your allies help you avoid being surprised.</em><br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you may act in the surprise round as long as your ally would normally be able to act in the surprise round. If you would normally be denied the ability to act in the surprise round, your initiative is equal to your initiative roll or the roll of your ally -1, whichever is lower. If both you and your ally would be able to act in the surprise round without the aid of this feat, you may take both a standard and a move action (or a full-round action) during the surprise round.<br/><br/><b>Combat Trick</b><br/>As long as you have at least 1 stamina point in your stamina pool, you gain the benefit of this feat as long as you are within 10 feet of an ally who has this feat.",
