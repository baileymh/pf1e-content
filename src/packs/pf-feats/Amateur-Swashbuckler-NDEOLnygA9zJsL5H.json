      "value": "<em>Though not a swashbuckler, you have and can use panache.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>No levels in a class that has the panache class feature.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>You gain a small amount of panache and the ability to perform a single 1st-level swashbuckler deed. Choose a 1st-level deed from the swashbuckler's deeds class feature (see page 56; you can't select opportune parry and riposte). Once chosen, this deed cannot be changed.<br/> At the start of each day, you gain 1 panache point. Throughout the day, you can gain a number of panache points up to a maximum of your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can regain panache points as the swashbuckler's panache class feature (see page 56). You can spend these panache points to perform the 1st-level deed you chose upon taking this feat as well as any other deeds you have gained through feats or magic items.<br/><br/><b>Special</b><br/>If you gain levels in a class that has the panache class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the Extra Panache feat.<br/><br/><b>Combat Trick</b><br/>Choose a second 1st-level swashbuckler deed. You can spend panache to use this deed, or you can spend 5 stamina points to use either of your deeds in place of panache. If you gain levels in a class that grants the panache class feature, you retain the ability to spend 5 stamina points in place of panache when using any of your 1st-level deeds, and this becomes a combat trick of the Extra Panache feat (even though that feat is not a combat feat).",
