      "value": "<em>You recruit a page who heralds your approach and has the ability to smooth the path of your diplomatic missions.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Character level 4th, proficiency with martial weapons.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>This feat is similar to the Leadership feat, with several exceptions. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a page) with this feat, and can't recruit followers. You determine your Leadership score according to the rules presented in the Leadership feat, but your page is always at least 3 levels lower than your level.<br/><br/> A page can take levels in bard, cavalier, or paladin. She cannot multiclass, though she can take any archetype for which she qualifies.<br/><br/> Whenever a page tries to influence a creature's attitude by using the Diplomacy skill, she can use her total Diplomacy skill bonus or yours. Any improvement of a creature's attitude toward the page also applies to you.<br/><br/> If a page gains enough XP to bring her to 2 levels lower than your level, she doesn't gain the new level until you gain your next level; until then, her XP total remains 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level and she gains no additional XP until you advance in level.<br/><br/> If you release your page from service or otherwise lose your page, you can recruit a new one. At 7th level, you can swap this feat for the Leadership feat.",
