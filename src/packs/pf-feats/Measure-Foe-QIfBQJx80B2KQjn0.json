      "value": "<em>You can read a foe's martial skill from its body language.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Street Smarts, base attack bonus +1.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>You can attempt a Sense Motive check as a free action to deduce a foe's martial training after observing the foe's movements for at least 1 minute or observing the foe's attacks for at least 2 rounds. You take a -10 penalty on your check if you are observing movements, rather than attacks. The DC equals 20 + the creature's base attack bonus or 10 + the creature's Bluff or Disguise modifier, whichever is higher. <br/><br/> If you succeed, you learn the foe's base attack bonus and one combat feat it has, and you learn an additional combat feat it has for every 5 points by which you exceed the DC. You also gain a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls against that foe and to your AC against that foe until the foe gains a level or otherwise improves its abilities. If you fail this check against a particular foe, you can't try again against that foe until you gain more ranks in Sense Motive.",
