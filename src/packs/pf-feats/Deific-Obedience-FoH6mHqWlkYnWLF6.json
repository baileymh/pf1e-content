      "value": "<em>Your reverence for a deity is so great that daily prayer and minor sacrifices grant you special boons.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Knowledge (religion) 3 ranks, must worship a deity.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>Each deity requires a different daily obedience, but all obediences take no more than 1 hour per day to perform. Once youve performed the obedience, you gain the benefit of a special ability or resistance as indicated in the Obedience entry for the god to whom you performed the obedience.<br/><br/>If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by your deity upon undertaking your obedience. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the second boon. If you have 20 Hit Dice or more, you also gain the third boon. Unless a specific duration or number of uses per day is listed, a boons effects are constant. If you have levels in the evangelist, exalted, or sentinel prestige classes, you gain access to these boons at lower levels as a benefit of your prestige class. If you have no levels in one of these prestige classes, you gain the boons marked as exalted boons. If you later take levels in sentinel or evangelist, you lose access to the exalted boons and gain access to the new boons appropriate to your class.<br/><br/>If you ever fail to perform a daily obedience, you lose all access to the benefits and boons granted by this feat until you next perform the obedience.",
