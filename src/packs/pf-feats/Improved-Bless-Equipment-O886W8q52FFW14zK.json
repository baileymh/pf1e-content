      "value": "<em>You can channel even more energy into weapons and armor to grant them several divine powers at once.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Bless Equipment, caster level 9th, channel energy class feature.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>The number of uses of channeled energy you must expend to bless a piece of equipment using Bless Equipment and Align Equipment decreases by one (to a minimum of one use of channel energy per blessing).<br/><br/> You can also bless a piece of equipment with up to two blessings at a time. Each blessing provides a different special ability drawn from the Bless Equipment list (and the Align Equipment list if you possess that feat). You must still have a high enough caster level to bless a piece of equipment with each of the selected blessings.<br/><br/> You expend the appropriate number of uses of channeled energy required for each blessing, taking into account the reduction granted by this feat (and the increase for blessing a masterwork item, if needed). For example, a cleric with this feat would need to expend two uses of channeled energy to bless a weapon with the undead-bane and ghost touch special abilities (one use for bane plus one use for ghost touch).<br/><br/> If a given piece of equipment already has a blessing on it, you can give it a second blessing. When another blessing is applied to a piece of equipment that currently has a blessing active on it, the durations for the two blessings are tracked separately.",
