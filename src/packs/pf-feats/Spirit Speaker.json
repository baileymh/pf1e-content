      "value": "<em>By absorbing spirits, you can learn how to set them free.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Cha 13, Con 13, Absorb Spirit, Diplomacy 5 ranks, must have died at least once or been possessed by an undead creature.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>When you absorb a spirit with the Absorb Spirit feat, you can converse with it through an internal dialogue in your mind. While conversing with the spirit, you can attempt Diplomacy checks to change its attitude toward you, as a normal use of that skill. If you are a medium with the haunt channeler class feature, you gain a +4 bonus on these Diplomacy checks. Once the spirit's attitude is indifferent or better, you can request to know what must be done to lay the spirit to rest, though the DC to do so is the DC to change its current attitude + 15. This takes into account the circumstance modifiers for the request in a typical situation, though it could be higher or lower in an unusual circumstance.<br/><br/> The spirit's starting attitude is usually hostile since you destroyed it and imprisoned it within you, interfering with its rejuvenation. If it's the spirit of an undead creature, it has the same Charisma bonus it had while fully manifested. If the spirit is that of a haunt, it has an effective Charisma based on its CR using the following table. <table class='inner'><tr><td><b>Haunt CR</b></td><td><b>Effective Charisma</b></td><td><b>(Modifier)</b></td></tr> <tr><td>1-4</td><td>12</td><td>(+1)</td></tr> <tr><td>5-8</td><td>16</td><td>(+3)</td></tr> <tr><td>9-12</td><td>20</td><td>(+5)</td></tr> <tr><td>13-16</td><td>24</td><td>(+7)</td></tr> <tr><td>17-20</td><td>28</td><td>(+9)</td></tr> <tr><td>21+</td><td>32</td><td>(+11)</td></tr></table><br/> Conversing with a spirit in this manner unsettles the mind. Each time you attempt a Diplomacy check using this ability to influence the spirit's attitude or make a request, you take 1 point of Wisdom damage. No effect can prevent or reduce the ability damage, nor can the ability damage be healed or suppressed by any means until you release the spirit.<br/><br/><b>Special</b><br/>If you are using the sanity system (page 12), when you attempt a Diplomacy check using this ability, you take 1d6 points of sanity damage instead of 1 point of Wisdom damage. No effect can prevent or reduce the damage, nor can the damage be healed or suppressed by any means until you release the spirit.",
