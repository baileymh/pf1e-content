      "value": "<em>You possess and can open a third eye that permits you to see things as they really are and gain greater insight into auras.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Psychic Sensitivity or ability to cast psychic spells.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>Once per day as a standard action, you can open a spiritual third eye positioned on your forehead between and above your normal eyes. You can keep this eye open for up to 1 minute per character level you possess. This duration doesn't have to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Once per day while your third eye is open, you can use the read aura occult skill unlock after 1 minute of intense concentration. This is in addition to the normal daily use of read aura (which still takes 10 minutes). While your third eye is open, you gain a +4 bonus on Perception checks to read auras, as well as a +8 bonus on Perception checks to detect invisible creatures or objects or see through magical disguises (both illusory ones and those provided by the change shape ability or polymorph magic). When you close your third eye, either voluntarily or at the end of the time limit, you are fatigued for an amount of time equal to the length of time you kept your third eye open.<br/><br/><b>Normal</b><br/>Without this feat, you must spend 10 minutes in intense concentration to read one of a creature or item's four auras, and you can do so only once per day.<br/><br/><b>Special</b><br/>You can take this feat multiple times. Its effects don't stack. Each time you take the feat, you increase the number of times per day you can open your third eye (and read an aura) by one.",
