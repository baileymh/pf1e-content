You circle around that path until your next turn, and this movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. You are considered to be in every space along the path for the purpose of threatening squares and providing flanking for other allies (but not yourself ), as well as whether you are in the area of an area effect. Other creatures can attack you (and touch you with beneficial touch spells) as if you were in every space along the path. However, you don't count as being in any of the spaces for the purpose of other creatures moving through an occupied space. At the beginning of your next turn, choose any space along the path to stop circling.",
