      "value": "<em>When you impale a target, you hinder its movement and can cause severe bleeding.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Impaling Critical, Critical Focus, Weapon Specialization with selected piercing melee weapon, base attack bonus +13.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>While you are using Impaling Critical to impale an opponent, and you are still holding onto that weapon, that opponent must succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check against you to pull your weapon out. If you have let go of your weapon, the impaled opponent must spend a standard action to remove the weapon. Until the opponent pulls the weapon out, his speed in all modes is halved and his maneuverability, if any, is reduced by one step. When the weapon comes out, instead of dealing the damage normal for Impaling Critical, you can deal bleed damage equal to your weapon's damage dice result once per round at the start of that opponent's turn.<br/><br/><b>Combat Trick</b><br/>When using this feat to impale a foe, you can spend 5 stamina points to immobilize the foe in its current space (instead of halving its movement) for as long as you maintain your grip and the foe is impaled. If you let go of the weapon, the foe can move, but its movement is still halved.",
