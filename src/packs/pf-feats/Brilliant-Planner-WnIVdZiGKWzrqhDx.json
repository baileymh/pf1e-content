      "value": "<p><em>Your experience and intellect enable you to create prescient plans and contingencies.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />Int 13, character level 5th.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />You can prepare for future contingencies without defining what those preparations are until they are relevant. As a part of this preparation, while in a settlement for at least 24 hours, you can take 8 hours and spend up to 50 gp per character level, which becomes your brilliant plan fund. While you have a brilliant plan pending, you are always treated as carrying 20 additional pounds of weight, even before you define your brilliant plan.<br /><br />Once per day, you can take 10 minutes to enact a brilliant plan, withdrawing an item that would have been available in a settlement you visited or procuring a mundane service that your character planned ahead of time. Once you enact the plan, subtract the price of the item or service from this feat's fund. Any item procured must weigh 10 pounds or less. Likewise, the GM must approve any nonmagical service you gain by using this feat as being appropriate for the location selected.<br /><br />Once you have spent all the money in your brilliant plan fund or procured 20 pounds of objects with this feat, you cannot use the feat again until you replenish your brilliant plan fund.</p>",
