      "value": "<p><em>Your spell-like ability induces fear in affected targets.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a fearsome spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).<br /><br />When a target takes damage from a fearsome spelllike ability and fails its saving throw against the spell-like ability, it becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to the spell-like ability's equivalent spell level. If the spell-like ability doesn't allow a saving throw, creatures harmed by it can attempt a Will save (against the DC that the spell-like ability would have if it allowed a saving throw) to negate the shaken effect. If the effect of the spell-like ability also causes targets to become shaken and a target fails its saving throw, the duration of the shaken condition caused by this effect stacks with the spell-like ability's. A fearsome spelllike ability can't cause a creature to become frightened, even if that creature is already shaken.<br /><br />You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see Table 3-1.<br /><br />Special: This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Spell Level</td>\n<td>Caster Level1</td>\n<td>Caster Level2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>10th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>12th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>14th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>16th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>18th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>20th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>1&nbsp;Bouncing, disruptive, intensified, lingering, or scarring ability.<br />2Fearsome, sickening, or traumatic ability.</p>",
