      "value": "<p><em>Your spell-like ability clings to affected targets and interferes with their spellcasting.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />Spell-like ability at caster level 4th or higher.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />Choose one of your spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. You can use the chosen spell-like ability as a disruptive spell-like ability up to three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day).<br /><br />For 1 round after you use a disruptive spell-like ability, affected targets attempting to cast as spell must attempt concentration checks when casting spells or use spell-like abilities (DC = the disruptive spell-like ability's DC + the level of the spell the target is casting or spell-like ability it's using). Targets that avoid the spell-like ability's effects also avoid this feat's effect.<br /><br />You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 1. For a summary, see Table 3-1.<br /><br /><strong>Special</strong><br />This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you can apply it to a different spell-like ability.<br /><br /></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Spell Level</td>\n<td>Caster Level1</td>\n<td>Caster Level2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>10th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>12th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>14th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>16th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>18th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>20th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>1&nbsp;Bouncing, disruptive, intensified, lingering, or scarring ability.<br />2Fearsome, sickening, or traumatic ability.<br /><br /></p>",
