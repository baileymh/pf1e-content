      "value": "<em>You are capable of entangling far greater prey with the help of your allies.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Exotic Weapon Proficiency (net), base attack bonus +1.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>If you ready an attack with a net to entangle a creature when an ally of your size who also has this feat attempts to entangle that creature with a net, the two of you can entangle the creature as if you were one size category larger. The entangled creature can attempt to escape both nets as though they were a single net, using the lower of the nets' hit points, hardness (if any), and DCs to break or escape. Only you or your ally can attempt to control the entangled creature's movement with an opposed Strength check, but your ally grants you a +1 bonus on the check. If you work with three other allies of the same size who have this feat, you can entangle a creature as if you were two size categories larger. If you work with seven other allies in this way, you can instead entangle a creature as if you were three size categories larger.<br/><br/><b>Normal</b><br/>A net is useful against only creatures within one size category of you.",
