      "value": "<em>You recruit a professional groom to care for your mount.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Character level 4th.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>This feat is similar to the Leadership feat, with several exceptions to note. You can attract only a 1st-level cohort (referred to hereafter as a groom) with this feat, and cannot recruit followers of his own. You determine your Leadership score according to the rules presented in the Leadership feat, but your groom is always at least 3 levels lower than your level.<br/><br/> A groom can take levels in bard, fighter, or ranger. A groom can't multiclass, though he can take any archetype for which he qualifies.<br/><br/> A groom finds the best place to stable and conceal your mount and the mounts of up to five allies while you and your allies are elsewhere. A groom adds half his level (minimum 1) to Stealth checks when concealing himself and any mounts that are left in his care. A groom also gains the ability to speak with animals as a supernatural ability, but he can use this ability only with horses, riding dogs, and other mounts of the animal type.<br/><br/> If a groom gains enough XP to bring him to 2 levels lower than your level, he doesn't gain the new level until you gain your next level; until you advance, his XP total remains 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level.<br/><br/> If you release your groom from service or otherwise lose your groom, you can recruit a new one. At 7th level, you can swap this feat for the Leadership feat. ",
