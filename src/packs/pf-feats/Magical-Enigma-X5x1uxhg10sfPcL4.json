The feature must be from a class you have at least 1 level in, and you must have the class feature. You can treat either your class level as being 1 higher, or your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score as 2 higher, for the purpose of calculating the effect of the selected power. This impacts only the calculations of your existing powers that are based on class level or the appropriate ability score. It does not grant you early access to abilities gained at higher levels.<br/><br/><b>Goal</b><br/> Learn and verify the chosen magic secret for your family, defeating a challenging foe in the process.<br/><br/><b>Completion Benefit</b><br/>Select one Knowledge skill or the Use Magic Device skill. This is now a class skill for you.",
