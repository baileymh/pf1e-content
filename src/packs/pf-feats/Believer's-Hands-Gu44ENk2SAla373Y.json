      "value": "<p><em>You can heal others with a touch of your hand.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />Wis 13, Believer's Boon, must be lawful good, alignment must be within one step of your deity's.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />Once per day, you can use the paladin's lay on hands ability. Your effective paladin level is equal to 1/2 your character level (minimum 1). If you already have (or later gain) the lay on hands ability, you instead gain one extra use of lay on hands each day.<br /><br /><strong>Special</strong><br />This feat counts as having the lay on hands ability for the purpose of qualifying for feats such as Extra Lay on Hands.<br /><br />If you grossly violate the code of conduct required by your deity, your alignment shifts so that it is more than one step away from your deity's, or you no longer worship your deity, you lose access to this feat. You can regain it once you atone for your misdeeds to your deity (see the atonement spell on page 245 of the Core Rulebook).</p>",
