You gain a +4 bonus on Sense Motive checks to determine whether a given creature is affiliated with that group and a +4 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks to conceal your animosity toward members of that group.<br /><br /><strong>Goal</strong><br />Deliver the killing blow to a number of your hated foes whose combined Hit Dice total is equal to 10 x your current character level.<br /><br /><strong>Completion Benefit</strong><br />You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff, Knowledge, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks against foes of your selected type, and a +2 bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls against them. These bonuses stack with a ranger's favored enemy bonuses.<br /><br /><strong>Special</strong><br />By meeting the goal of this feat, your name becomes known to your enemy. Creatures of your chosen enemy faction gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against you should they become aware of your identity with a successful Knowledge (local) check (DC = 10 + your character level).</p>",
