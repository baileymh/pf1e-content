      "value": "<em>Your inspired architecture shall make your name immortal.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Knowledge (engineering) 1 rank, and you must have built a structure worth at least 5, 000 gp.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>When you supervise a construction project or do the construction yourself, reduce your raw material costs by 10%. You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (engineering) checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in Knowledge (engineering), this bonus increases to +4.<br/><br/><b>Goal</b><br/> Design and construct a building worth at least 100,000 gp with great personal significance to you. For example, you might construct a new temple for your god on the site where an old temple was destroyed, or an academy for students to unlock the secrets of the universe.<br/><br/><b>Completion Benefit</b><br/>The value of any past and future buildings you construct (including the building constructed to achieve your goal) increases by 10% as your reputation spreads. In addition, you and your workers complete double the normal amount of work in a given time interval when you supervise a construction project.",
