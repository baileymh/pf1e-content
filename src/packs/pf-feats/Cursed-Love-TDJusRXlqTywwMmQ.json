      "value": "<em>Your love forces you to endure the harshest of endeavors, despite the fact that most people would view your romance as madness.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>You must have a romantic interest who has fallen to some dark influence and rejects you out of shame or fear of newfound capabilities, or must have the Bad Romance or Temptation background.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>You are well versed in a dark society's way of thinking and in weathering abuse. Select a form of corruption that your lover fell to or willingly embraced: evil divine casters, evil arcane casters, undead creatures, or humanoid creatures with the shapeshifter subtype. You gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks when dealing with such creatures, and a +2 bonus on saving throws to resist any effects that would spread their corruption to you (such as a vampire's create spawn ability or a werewolf 's curse of lycanthropy). Once per day, when you would normally be reduced below 0 hit points by an attack from such a creature, you instead immediately gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half your character level.<br/><br/><b>Goal</b><br/> Find a way to be with your lover in a permanent fashion, either by persuading your lover to reject the influence of evil or by willingly embracing the same corruption.<br/><br/><b>Completion Benefit</b><br/>You no longer suffer abuse from those with whom your lover associates, and instead command a measure of their respect. You gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks against members of your chosen form of corruption. If you have 10 or more ranks in Intimidate, this bonus increases to +4. When you would normally be reduced below 0 hit points by an attack from such a source, you instead immediately gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your character level.",
