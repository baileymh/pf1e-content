      "value": "<p><em>Escaping death strengthened your bond to life, but fills you with a need for answers.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />You must have been slain and brought back from the dead, or have the Left to Die or Cursed Birth background.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />You don't die until your negative hit point total is equal to or greater than 4 + your Constitution score. Once per day as a standard action, you can force yourself to carry on by strength of will alone, gaining 1 temporary hit point per hit die. These temporary hit points last for 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong><br />You meet in person and hear the words of your deity or your deity's chosen herald. If you worship a pantheon of deities, you must meet and hear a member of that pantheon--a herald does not suffice in this case. If you worship no specific deity, you must hear the words of an appropriate entity of the GM's choice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Completion Benefit</strong><br />You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects and fear effects. In addition, the caster level of any conjuration (healing) spell that is cast on you increases by 1 for the purposes of its effects on you alone.</p>",
