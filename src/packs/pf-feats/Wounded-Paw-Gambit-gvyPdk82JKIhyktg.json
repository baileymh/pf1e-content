      "value": "<em>Your enemy sees you as an easy mark, but doesn't notice your allies poised to shoot.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Broken Wing Gambit, Bluff 5 ranks.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>Whenever you use Broken Wing Gambit and an opponent attacks you as a result, each ally who has this feat and is within 30 feet of that opponent can attempt a ranged attack against it as an immediate action. The ally's ranged weapon must be in hand, loaded, and ready to be fired or thrown in order to make this attack possible.<br/><br/> An ally who has this feat and Broken Wing Gambit can instead use Broken Wing Gambit to attempt an attack of opportunity against the foe, but cannot attempt both that attack of opportunity and this ranged attack.<br/><br/><b>Combat Trick</b><br/>When you make a ranged attack granted by this feat, you can spend 5 stamina points to make that ranged attack as an attack of opportunity instead of as an immediate action. You can still use this feat to make an extra attack only once per round.",
