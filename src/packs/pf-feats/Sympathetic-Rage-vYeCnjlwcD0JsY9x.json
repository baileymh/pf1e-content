      "value": "<em>Seeing an ally rage fills you with your own fury.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Half-orc or orc, nonlawful.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who is raging, you may choose to enter a similar but less powerful rage as a free action on your turn. This weaker rage gives you all the benefits and penalties of a barbarian's rage, except your morale bonus to Strength and Constitution is only +2. There is no limit to how long you can rage, as long as you remain adjacent to a raging ally (for example, you could take a 5-foot step away from one raging ally toward another raging ally and maintain your rage). As with a barbarian's rage, when this weaker rage ends, you are fatigued. You cannot use this feat if you are fatigued.<br/><br/><b>Combat Trick</b><br/>When an ally within 30 feet is raging, you can spend 5 stamina points to enter a sympathetic rage even if you aren't adjacent to that ally. Until the rage ends, you only need to stay within 30 feet of a raging ally to maintain your sympathetic rage.",
