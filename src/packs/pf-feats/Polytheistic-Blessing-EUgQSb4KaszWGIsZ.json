You gain the listed spell-like ability for your selected pantheon, usable once per day. If the granted spell allows a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier.<br /><br /><strong>Special</strong><br />If you act out of line with the tenets of your pantheon's beliefs, you lose the ability to cast the granted spell-like ability until you have received an atonement for your transgression (as a cleric attempting to regain lost class abilities).<br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Juju Pantheon (Cultural)</h2>\n<p><strong>Deities</strong> wendo (supernatural entities of the spirit world; see Faiths &amp; Philosophies 14)</p>\n<p><strong>Common Believers</strong> juju practitioners, wendifa</p>\n<p><strong>Granted Spell-like Ability</strong> speak with animals<br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Sar-Gorog Pantheon (Aligned and Cultural)</h2>\n<p><strong>Deities</strong> Urgathoa (NE), Rovagug (CE), and Zura (CE)</p>\n<p><strong>Common Believers </strong>Koboto cannibal tribes of the Sodden Lands</p>\n<p><strong>Granted Spell-like Ability </strong>decompose corpseUM; if you use this ability on a corpse rather than on a corporeal undead, you receive nourishment as though you had eaten a normal meal for a Medium creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong><br />This feat first appeared in Pathfinder Player Companion: Faiths &amp; Philosophies as Pantheistic Blessing, but is corrected and expanded here to include a benefit for juju practitioners and worshipers of Sar-Gorog.</p>",
