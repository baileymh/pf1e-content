      "value": "<em>Your magic flows through your ally.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Spellcraft 3 ranks.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>Whenever you are within 30 feet of an ally who also has this feat, you can channel your magic through her when casting a spell or using a spell-like ability, provided that she has the spell on her class list or has the ability to cast it as a spell-like ability. The spell cannot have a range of personal. When you finish casting the spell, the ally may spend an immediate action to act as your conduit. Your ally must concentrate to act as the conduit for the spell, just as if she were casting the spell, and the spell is lost if a concentration check is required and she fails (such as from damage, or to cast the spell defensively).<br/><br/> If successfully cast, the spell originates from the ally's space instead of yours. You remain the spell's caster for the purpose of determining the caster level, saving throw DC, and so on, but your ally selects the targets or area affected and makes any required attack rolls for the spell.",
