      "value": "<em>You hurl a weapon during your charge before drawing a new one to strike, enabling you to make another attack at the expense of the latter attack's accuracy.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Quick Draw, base attack bonus +6.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>If you have a thrown weapon in hand when you begin charging, you can make a ranged attack with that weapon against the target of your charge at any point during your charge. You gain the +2 bonus for charging on the attack roll for this ranged attack. You can then immediately draw a melee weapon during your charge. You take a -5 penalty on the melee attack made at the end of the charge. When charging this way, you cannot use any effect that would grant you more than one attack at the end of your charge (such as pounce), nor can you use abilities that grant you other ranged attacks on a charge, such as the hurling charge rage power.",
