      "value": "<p><em>The confines of the Material Plane cannot sate your wanderlust, and you walk between alternate spheres of reality unhindered.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />You must be related to an outsider or have been born on a plane other than the Material Plane.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />You gain a +2 bonus on Survival checks when outside your home plane. You can identify portals and other planar connections as well as where they lead by sight or touch with a successful DC 20 Perception check.<br /><br /><strong>Goal</strong><br />Spend at least 24 consecutive hours on three different planes of existence other than your home plane or more than a month on a single plane other than your home plane. Demiplanes do not count for the purposes of fulfilling this <br /><br /><strong>Completion Benefit</strong><br />Whenever you cast a spell or use a magic item to travel to another plane, you always arrive exactly where you had intended. In addition, when identifying portals with the first benefit of this feat, you gain a glimpse of what you would see, hear, and smell upon arriving on the other end of the portal. <br /><br />Suggested Traits: Fey Protection, Scholar of the Great BeyondAPG, Wanderlust.</p>\n<h2>Possible Planar Traveler Quests</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\">\n<tbody style=\"user-select: auto !important; margin-top: 0px;\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 6.63697%;\">d8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 92.3922%;\">Quest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 6.63697%;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width: 92.3922%;\">Your morbid curiosity urges you to journey through the Worldwound, either to contact or combat what impossible fiendish entities no doubt lurk beyond (page 198).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 6.63697%;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 92.3922%;\">Several weak points exist between the forested realms of the River Kingdoms and the plane known as the First World.
