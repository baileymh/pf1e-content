The illumination provided is equal in intensity to that of a torch. If you have at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (planes) the illumination is equivalent to that created by a daylight spell. If you have at least 15 ranks in Knowledge (planes), the light becomes further infused with Heavenly power, and each evil creature within 30 feet of you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) or become sickened by the light for as long as it remains in range plus 1 additional round after leaving the area.<br/><br/> You can use this feat's benefit for a number of rounds per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). These rounds need not be consecutive.",
