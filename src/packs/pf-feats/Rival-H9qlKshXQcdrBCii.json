If you have multiple rivals, the GM may keep the specific rival secret, or have many of your enemies work together against you. If your rival is not already a challenging foe, it either advances to become one or allies itself with others one or more creatures who are .<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>Your striving pushes you to become ever more skillful. When you gain this feat, and every 2 character levels thereafter, either you gain 1 skill point or your Fame score increases by 1 (if your game uses the reputation and Fame system from Ultimate Campaign).<br/><br/><b>Goal</b><br/> Thwart your rival without anyone else directly interfering. Achieving your rival's <br/><br/><b>Goal</b><br/> before her in a manner that humiliates her or completely steals her glory through your direct actions also qualifies.<br/><br/><b>Completion Benefit</b><br/>Once per day, you can take 20 on a single skill check as a standard action if the skill check is one that would allow you to take 20.",
