      "value": "<em>You can travel between magic plants and plants with which you have an affinity.</em><br/><br/><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>Con 13, character level 7th, plant type.<br/><br/><b>Benefits</b><br/>Once per day, you can step into an adjacent plant with which you share affinity, then exit from a plant of the same kind. This functions as tree stride with the following changes: the duration is 1 round; the transport range is 200 feet per character level; transporting yourself is a standard action; and a ghoran using this ability can pass through any living tree, while a vine leshy can pass through any living vine. You can also enter any magically created or enhanced plants, such as those produced by wall of thorns or plants affected by entangle, then exit from either another similar plant or a plant with which you have an affinity.<br/><br/><b>Special</b><br/>The GM determines plant affinity for non-ghoran and non-vine leshy plant creatures.",
