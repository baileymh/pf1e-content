      "value": "<p><em>You can fight with a weapon wielded in each of your hands. You can make one extra attack each round with the secondary weapon.</em><br /><br /><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br />Dex 15.<br /><br /><strong>Benefits</strong><br />Your penalties on attack rolls for fighting with two weapons are reduced. The penalty for your primary hand lessens by 2 and the one for your off hand lessens by 6. See Two-Weapon Fighting in Combat.<br /><br /><strong>Normal</strong><br />If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon. When fighting in this way you suffer a -6 penalty with your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a -10 penalty to the attack with your off hand. If your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each. An unarmed strike is always considered light.<br /><br /><strong>Combat Trick</strong><br />You can spend any number of stamina points to reduce the penalty from Two-Weapon Fighting on attacks made with a weapon in your primary hand by 1 for every 2 stamina points you spent. This benefit lasts until the start of your next turn. You can't reduce the penalty below 0.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Usage</strong>: adjust penalties in your attacks or conditional modifiers.</p>",
