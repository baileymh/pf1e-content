You acquire and advance this beast companion in the same way as an animal companion detailed in the class feature that grants you access to your animal companion. You can also dismiss the creature, as dictated by your class feature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You must meet additional prerequisites to select a companion with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, as described in each creature&rsquo;s entry.</p>\n<h2>Beast Companion Choices</h2>\n<p>The following creatures can be chosen as beast companions by a character with the Beast Speaker feat. Their entries and advancement are the same as for animal companions, with two exceptions. <br />First, creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher have one or more additional prerequisites the character must meet to select the companion. Second, each beast companion has a mastery ability that it can use only if the character it is bonded to has the Beast Speaker Mastery feat. The minimum level to gain this ability is listed in parentheses. The save DC for any of a beast companion&rsquo;s special abilities is 10 + half the beast companion&rsquo;s HD + the beast companion&rsquo;s Constitution modifier.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Basilisk</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Starting Statistics<br /></strong>Size Medium; Speed 20 ft.; AC +4 natural armor; Attack bite (1d4); Ability Scores Str 16, Dex 10, Con 15, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 11; Special Qualities darkvision 60 ft., lowlight vision, gaze (one target within 30 ft., paralysis 1d4 rounds, Fortitude negates, once per day).</p>\n<p><strong>9th-Level Advancement<br /></strong>AC +2 natural armor; Ability Scores Dex +4, Con +4; Attack bite (1d6); Special Qualities gaze (three times per day).</p>\n<p><strong>Mastery (11th level)<br /></strong>The basilisk&rsquo;s gaze attack functions as flesh to stone (caster level equals basilisk&rsquo;s HD) instead of inflicting paralysis.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Behir</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites<br /></strong>Diplomacy or Intimidate 7 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 7 ranks.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Statistics<br /></strong>Size Medium; Speed 40 ft., climb 20 ft.; AC +6 natural armor; Attack bite (1d6); Ability Scores Str 16, Dex 12, Con 16, Int 7, Wis 14, Cha 12; Special Attacks breath weapon (20-ft. line, 4d6 electricity damage, Reflex half, once per day), grab; Special Qualities electricity resistance 10.</p>\n<p><strong>Mastery (11th level)</strong><br />Size Large; AC +2 natural armor; Attack bite (1d8); Ability Scores Str +4, Dex &ndash;2, Con +2; Special Attacks breath weapon (three times per day), constrict 1d8; Special Qualities immune to electricity.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Bulette</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Starting Statistics<br /></strong>Size Medium; Speed 40 ft., burrow 20 ft.; AC +4 natural armor; Attack bite (1d6), 2 claws (1d4); Ability Scores Str 16, Dex 14, Con 16, Int 2, Wis 13, Cha 6.</p>\n<p><strong>Mastery (11th level)</strong><br />Size Large; AC +4 natural armor; Attack bite (1d8), claws (1d6); Ability Scores Str +4, Dex &ndash;2, Con +2; Special Attacks leap (When charging, it can attempt a DC 20 Acrobatics check to jump into the air and land next to its enemies.
