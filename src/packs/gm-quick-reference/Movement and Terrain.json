  "content": "<h2>Moving Through a Square</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 193</em></p>\n<p>You can move through an unoccupied square without difficulty in most circumstances. Difficult terrain and a number of spell effects might hamper your movement through open spaces.<br /><br /><strong>Friend</strong>: You can move through a square occupied by a friendly character, unless you are charging. When you move through a square occupied by a friendly character, that character doesn&rsquo;t provide you with cover (see page 195).<br /><br /><strong>Opponent</strong>: You can&rsquo;t move through a square occupied by an opponent unless the opponent is helpless. You can move through a square occupied by a helpless opponent without penalty. Some creatures, particularly very large ones, may present an obstacle even when helpless. In such cases, each square you move through counts as 2 squares.<br /><br /><strong>Ending Your Movement</strong>: You can&rsquo;t end your movement in the same square as another creature unless it is helpless.<br /><br /><strong>Overrun</strong>: During your movement, you can attempt to move through a square occupied by an opponent (see page 201).<br /><br /><strong>Tumbling</strong>: A trained character can attempt to use Acrobatics to move through a square occupied by an opponent (see the Acrobatics skill).<br /><br /><strong>Very Small Creature</strong>: A Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creature can move into or through an occupied square. The creature provokes attacks of opportunity when doing so.<br /><br /><strong>Square Occupied by Creature Three Sizes Larger or Smaller</strong>: Any creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories larger than itself.<br /><br />A big creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories smaller than it is. Creatures moving through squares occupied by other creatures provoke attacks of opportunity from those creatures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Designated Exceptions:</strong> Some creatures break the above rules. A creature that completely fills the squares it occupies cannot be moved past, even with the Acrobatics skill or similar special abilities.</p>\n<h1>Terrain and Obstacles</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 193</em></p>\n<p>From tangled plants to broken stone, there are a number of terrain features that can affect your movement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Difficult Terrain</strong>: Difficult terrain, such as heavy undergrowth, broken ground, or steep stairs, hampers movement. Each square of difficult terrain counts as 2 squares of movement. Each diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts as 3 squares. You can&rsquo;t run or charge across difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>If you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can move only as fast as the most difficult terrain you occupy will allow.</p>\n<p>Flying and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Obstacles</strong>: Like difficult terrain, obstacles can hamper movement. If an obstacle hampers movement but doesn&rsquo;t completely block it, each obstructed square or obstacle between squares counts as 2 squares of movement. You must pay this cost to cross the obstacle, in addition to the cost to move into the square on the other side. If you don&rsquo;t have sufficient movement to cross the obstacle and move into the square on the other side, you can&rsquo;t cross it. Some obstacles may also require a skill check to cross.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some obstacles block movement entirely. A character can&rsquo;t move through a blocking obstacle.</p>\n<p>Flying and incorporeal creatures are able to avoid most obstacles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Squeezing</strong>: In some cases, you may have to squeeze into or through an area that isn&rsquo;t as wide as the space you take up. You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. Each move into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls and a &ndash;4 penalty to AC.</p>\n<p>When a Large creature (which normally takes up 4 squares) squeezes into a space that&rsquo;s 1 square wide, the creature&rsquo;s miniature figure occupies 2 squares, centered on the line between the 2 squares. For a bigger creature, center the creature likewise in the area it squeezes into.</p>\n<p>A creature can squeeze past a creature while moving but it can&rsquo;t end its movement in an occupied square.</p>\n<p>To squeeze through or into a space less than half your space&rsquo;s width, you must use the Escape Artist skill. You can&rsquo;t attack while using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space, you take a &ndash;4 penalty to AC, and you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>\n<h1>Special Movement Rules</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 194</em></p>\n<p>These rules cover special movement situations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Accidentally Ending Movement in an Illegal Space</strong>: Sometimes a character ends its movement while moving through a space where it&rsquo;s not allowed to stop. When that happens, put your miniature in the last legal position you occupied, or the closest legal position, if there&rsquo;s a legal position that&rsquo;s closer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Double Movement Cost</strong>: When your movement is hampered in some way, your movement usually costs double. For example, each square of movement through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, and each diagonal move through such terrain counts as 3 squares ( just as two diagonal moves normally do).</p>\n<p>If movement cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as 4 squares (or as 6 squares if moving diagonally). If movement cost is doubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if diagonal) and so on. This is an exception to the general rule that two doublings are equivalent to a tripling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum Movement</strong>: Despite whatever penalties to movement you might have, you can take a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. This rule doesn&rsquo;t allow you to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited. Such movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal (despite the distance covered, this move isn&rsquo;t a 5-foot step).</p>",
