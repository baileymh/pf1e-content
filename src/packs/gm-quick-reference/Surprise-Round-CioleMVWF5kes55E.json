  "content": "<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 178</em></p>\n<p>When a combat starts, if you are not aware of your opponents and they are aware of you, you&rsquo;re surprised.</p>\n<p>Sometimes all the combatants on a side are aware of their opponents, sometimes none are, and sometimes only some of them are. Sometimes a few combatants on each side are aware and the other combatants on each side are unaware.</p>\n<p>Determining awareness may call for Perception checks or other checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Surprise Round</strong>: If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise round happens before regular rounds begin. In initiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their opponents each take a standard or move action during the surprise round. You can also take free actions during the surprise round.</p>\n<p>If no one or everyone is surprised, no surprise round occurs.</p>\n<p><strong>Unaware Combatants</strong>: Combatants who are unaware at the start of battle don&rsquo;t get to act in the surprise round. Unaware combatants are flat-footed because they have not acted yet, so they lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>",
