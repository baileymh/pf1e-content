Its tainted blood is unable to clot, and rushes out of even minor wounds. Whenever the affected creature takes at least 5 points of piercing or slashing damage, it also takes 2 points of bleed damage. This bleed damage stacks with other bleed damage, including itself. Whenever the affected creature takes bleed damage in this way, a thin but far-reaching spray of blood erupts from the wound, exposing all creatures in a 15-foot cone (pointing toward the source of the attack) to the disease unless they succeed at Reflex saving throws at the disease&rsquo;s DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Moderate&nbsp;</strong>Blood begins to ooze through the affected creature&rsquo;s pores, coating its skin in a thin, red sheen.

The affected creature can attempt a Will save at the disease&rsquo;s DC as a free action to suppress this effect for 1 minute, but if it fails this save, it can&rsquo;t try again for 1 hour; even if it succeeds, it must continue to attempt a save whenever it takes damage to avoid flying back into a berserk state.</p>\n<p><strong>Terminal&nbsp;</strong>The affected creature can no longer attempt a saving throw to suppress its rage. If it fails a saving throw against the disease&rsquo;s progress at this stage, it dies. Even on a successful saving throw, the affected creature takes 10d10 points of damage and 2 points of Constitution drain.

While the character can build new memories, he has trouble accessing those gained before he contracted amnesia.

He retains his base attack bonus, saving throws bonuses (though he takes a -4 penalty on Will saves), CMB, CMD, total XP, Hit Dice, and hit points. If a character gains a character level while suffering from amnesia, he can use any abilities gained via that class level normally. If the class level he gained was of a class in which he already had levels, he initially gains the abilities of a 1st-level character of that class, even though he is technically of a higher level in that class, and then progresses from there. When the amnesia is cured, the character regains the full abilities of the class; recalculate his level based on his total XP.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[["Maladies"],["Madness"]],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"amnesia","useCustomTag":false,"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"featType":"misc","associations":{"classes":[]},"showInQuickbar":false,"abilityType":"none","crOffset":"","disabled":false,"classSkills":{},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428376499,"modifiedTime":1677435545438,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
