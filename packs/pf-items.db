This practice is highly refined in kobold culture, and requires a substantial amount of psychological subtlety. Many kobold trappers use physical lures to draw victims into such ambushes. These lures are most often replica items, chosen to appeal to the intended prey. Because kobolds have little in-depth contact with the surface-dwelling world, their replicas lack detail, and usually don't stand up to close inspection.<br/><br/> <strong>Fake Area Map</strong>: This faux-distressed piece of parchment is a crude map of the local area, with red circles and arcane gibberish scrawled on it. Intentionally made to look old and worn, it's actually a simple piece of parchment that's been singed, crumpled, and rolled in the dirt. Because the average kobold artisan's knowledge of Common is poor, any literate creature within 5 feet can identify the map as a fake. However, beyond 5 feet, a fake map requires a successful DC 25 Sense Motive check to identify it as phony.<br/><br/> <strong>Fake Coins</strong>: These rough-hewn discs of metal are covered in highly ref lective, gold-colored plating, which catches the light and causes them to shimmer. At a distance greater than 5 feet, fake coins require a DC 20 Sense Motive check to identify. However, because these 'coins' aren't molded and have no embellishment on either side, any creature within 5 feet can clearly identify them as spurious.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":5,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"lureFakeCoins","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428365679,"modifiedTime":1677435521890,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

When squeezed out of its container and exposed to air, bone paste quickly hardens, so in order to apply it to a surface or object one must typically squeeze the paste directly onto the material to be affected. Once applied, bone paste cements itself to the object in just seconds, and hardens into a flaky cast. If applied to any unattended organic material or surface (such as wood, paper, hide, or rope), after 1 hour, bone paste undergoes another alchemical reaction and begins to eat away at the material, dealing 1d4 points of damage each round for 1d6+1 rounds, eating away first at the part of the object to which it was applied and spreading briefly to other parts of the object before dissipating and leaving a small amount of residual dust. Bone paste ignores an organic object's hardness, and does not deal damage to inorganic objects or surfaces (such as metal, stone, or ceramic). One pouch of bone paste is enough to cover 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 20 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 20</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":75,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"bonePaste","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428365687,"modifiedTime":1677435526977,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

(reinforcing boss)</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2><p>A shield boss is a sturdy steel device that fastens to the front of a shield, providing metal support struts that radiate outward from the center of the shield, reinforcing its structure. A shield boss can be added to a buckler, light steel or wooden shield, or heavy steel or wooden shield. Tower shields are too large for a typical shield boss, though one can be crafted to fit a tower shield for an additional 300 gp. Attaching or removing a shield boss requires 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 15 Craft (armor) check; on a failure, the shield boss is not successfully attached or removed and the shield takes 1d6 points of damage that bypasses any hardness.<br/><br/> A reinforcing boss provides extra protection to a shield, increasing the shield's current and maximum hit points by 10. The boss makes the shield 10 pounds heavier and more unwieldy-if the shield imposes a penalty on attack rolls, as do bucklers and tower shields, the penalty increases by 1. Common improvements to the basic reinforcing boss include the following.<br/><br/> <strong>Breakaway Boss</strong>: The metal stud at the center of the reinforcing boss holds a compartment large enough to insert a single splash weapon, such as a vial of acid or alchemist's fire, as a full-round action. On a successful shield bash attack, the weapon vial breaks and deals damage to the target as though it were directly hit by the splash weapon. The shield takes the normal amount of splash damage for being adjacent to the target, but no other creatures adjacent to the target take splash damage from this effect. A new splash weapon must be inserted into the breakaway boss for it to be used again.<br/><br/> <strong>Hooked Boss</strong>: The struts on this reinforcing boss bear large, sturdy hooks, which can be used to snag an opponent's clothing or armor, causing it to stumble. You can attempt trip combat maneuver checks with this shield. If the combat maneuver check is successful, the opponent does not fall prone, but is considered flat-footed until the beginning of its next turn.<br/><br/> <strong>Illuminating Boss</strong>: The stud at the center of this reinforcing boss contains a covered slot large enough to insert a sunrod. Installing a lit sunrod into an illuminating boss is a full-round action. If you shake the shield firmly as a move action, you can flip a metal flap fitted over the slot to conceal or reveal the sunrod's glow.<br/><br/> <strong>Masterwork Boss</strong>: Any of the bosses listed above, including the basic reinforcing boss, can be masterwork. A masterwork reinforcing boss increases the shield's current and maximum hit points by 15 instead of 10 and doesn't increase the attack roll penalty.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":12},"price":35,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"shieldBossIlluminating","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428365730,"modifiedTime":1677435521962,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

In addition, the drinker loses all memory of events that transpired during the 1d4 minutes directly following consumption of a draught of icecap ale; a successful DC 20 Fortitude save negates this memory loss. Additional doses of icecap ale imbibed during the hour following an initial dose cause the drinker to become sickened for 1 minute (instead of gaining a bonus to Strength and Constitution) and to suffer all the negative effects of icecap ale.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Alchemical Recipe</h2><p><strong>Recipe</strong> (50 spirit of wine + 40 urea)/distillation; <strong>Craft</strong> 20<br/><strong>Time</strong> 1 week; <strong>Tools</strong> brewer's kit; <strong>Type</strong> alcohol</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0.5},"price":40,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Icecap Ale","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"icecapAle","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Remedies"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"potion","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428365735,"modifiedTime":1677435526979,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Essentially harmless, implanting fleshgems became a unique racial method of body alteration among oreads, equivalent to tattoos and piercings among other humanoids. Decorative fleshgems cost 1 gp and are merely ornamental.

Implanting a set of fleshgem spikes takes 10 minutes, and the resulting shard takes about a week to grow to full size. Removing a fleshgem takes 1 minute; the person removing the gem must make a successful DC 15 Heal check to avoid dealing 1d4 points of damage to the oread.

Because the average kobold artisan's knowledge of Common is poor, any literate creature within 5 feet can identify the map as a fake. However, beyond 5 feet, a fake map requires a successful DC 25 Sense Motive check to identify it as phony.<br/><br/> <strong>Fake Coins</strong>: These rough-hewn discs of metal are covered in highly ref lective, gold-colored plating, which catches the light and causes them to shimmer.

(spikes)</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2><p>An oread adventurer discovered these small green gemstones when, after suffering a wound from falling on some jagged stones while exploring a cavern, she noticed pieces of beautiful green crystal growing from her skin. Oread jewelers found that these crystals, dubbed fleshgems, seemed to feed on the elemental energy that permeates an oread's flesh, growing from tiny chips of stone into large, elaborate gemstones. Essentially harmless, implanting fleshgems became a unique racial method of body alteration among oreads, equivalent to tattoos and piercings among other humanoids. Decorative fleshgems cost 1 gp and are merely ornamental. Fleshgem spikes, on the other hand, grow into elaborate crystalline shards that function as armor spikes, but the oread wearing them cannot wear armor over the spikes and even normal clothing requires special holes or seams to allow the spikes to stick out.

By standing on the footrests and holding the tops of the poles you can avoid certain ground-based threats to your feet. For example, you can use stilts to cross water without getting wet, but you would still activate a trap that triggers when you walk in a certain area. Using stilts reduces your base speed from 30 feet to 20 feet, or from 20 feet to 15 feet. You can hop off your stilts as a move action, or as a free action with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check.<br/><br/> You must use both your hands to walk with stilts. Walking with stilts requires a DC 5 Acrobatics check for each move. Failing this check means you do not move for that move action; failing by 5 or more means you fall off the stilts. If you want to use one hand for something else while standing on stilts, you must succeed at a DC 10 Acrobatics check or lose the action; if you want to use two hands, the DC increases to 20.<br/><br/> Stilts for a Medium creature raise you 2 feet above the ground; stilts for a Small creature raise you 1 foot from the ground. You can use taller stilts, but each additional foot of elevation increases the Acrobatics DCs of using stilts by +5. A stilt has hardness 5 and 10 hit points. If you only have one stilt, your speed drops to 5 feet because you can only hop rather than walk.<br/><br/><em>Masterwork Stilts</em>: These stilts strap to your feet and legs, allowing you to use your hands for other tasks without penalty. Walking on masterwork stilts requires a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Attaching or removing a masterwork stilt is a full-round action.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":10},"price":0.2,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"stilts","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428365927,"modifiedTime":1677435522155,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

A sureseal bladder is made of a thin membrane that won't allow liquid through. By passing a solid spout or tube through the membrane, you can fill the bladder without allowing in any ambient seawater, and the membrane seals behind the spout. Once the bladder is full, the drinker can nip on the end of the membrane in order to sip the drink at her leisure, slowly crumpling the bladder for eventual disposal. The cheaper mundane sureseal bladders hold about 2 cups of liquid and work best for enjoying a favorite drink; the listed weight assumes the mundane sureseal bladder is full. Potions rely on drinking the entire dose, so potion sureseal bladders, while much smaller (just large enough for a potion), are pressurized in order to expel the entire potion at once without losing any of it, allowing the drinker to drink them as a standard action just like drinking a potion above the waves.

The simplest form of code rod costs 1 sp and weighs 1 pound. If the rod has another use other than as a code rod, it uses the higher price and weight of the two items. Two code rods of matching circumference must be used in pairs to work properly. The second rod can be an item similar to the first, or it can simply be made to the same dimensions. To use a code rod, a long, narrow strip of paper is wrapped around the rod in a spiral pattern such that the edge of the paper touches the previous circuit with each pass, forming a continuous surface. A message is written along the length of the rod, one character to each coil of paper, row by row, until the paper is full. Once the message is completed, the strip of paper is unwound, rendering the message indecipherable. It can then be rolled up and sent to the recipient, who wraps it around the other rod and can then read the message. The users can write in plain language or further encode the message. Someone intercepting the message, if they recognize the use of a code rod, can attempt to find another rod of similar circumference, using Linguistics to crack the code rod's message.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":0.1,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Code rod","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"codeRod","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428366270,"modifiedTime":1677435522492,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

It takes 10 minutes to apply fire ink, and 1 dose covers an approximately hand-sized area. Once applied, the ink glows as a candle for 24 hours. Four or more doses applied to the same part of the body glow as a torch for 24 hours. The alchemical reaction of the ink to the target's skin and body heat is painful and irritating, giving the target the sickened condition while the glow lasts. A DC 15 Heal check can temporarily soothe these sensations, negating the sickened condition for 1 hour. Creatures immune or resistant to fire are immune to this sickening effect. Ifrits are especially known for their fondness for fire ink, and ifrit fire-dancers often decorate their skin with flaming designs before performing.

If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the attack succeeds, the creature has stepped on a caltrop. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop.

Layers of material are thinner than normal, hasps and hinges are only loosely attached, metals are mixed improperly, resulting in softer alloys, and so forth. Shoddy items are sold for the same price as their well-made counterparts. Manufacturing a shoddy item requires the Craft Shoddy Item feat (see above) in order to successfully conceal the poor workmanship. Shoddy items are never masterwork or made of special materials (though they might appear to be made of a special material), and single-use items can never be made as shoddy items.<br/><br/> Any shoddy item has its hardness reduced by 2 and its hit points reduced by half. Any weapon or piece of armor constructed in a shoddy manner takes damage each time it is used; a weapon takes the same amount of damage it deals in an attack (minus its lower hardness rating), and a piece of armor takes damage identical to its wearer's loss in hit points from an enemy's successful attack (again, after taking the adjusted hardness into account). Items other than weapons and armor have a 10% chance to gain the broken condition with each day of use, and if they have a limited number of uses, they have half as many uses as normal. In either case, shoddy items that gain the broken condition can never have that condition removed (even by using magic or if they later recover hit points) without further successful Craft checks and gp expenditure to fix the initial flaws. Shoddy items that are destroyed cannot be recovered by any means, and are useless for anything more than salvaging some of the raw materials. A shoddy item typically costs the same as a normal item of its kind.<br/><br/> A character who succeeds at a DC 15 Appraise (or appropriate Craft) check notices the shoddy condition of an item, but the character must specifically inspect the item to do so.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"shoddyItem","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428366331,"modifiedTime":1677435522551,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Where other races would be appalled at the thought of plants taking root in their flesh, oreads see it as a natural and healthy extension of their elemental nature. For this reason, oread herbalists developed several strains of moss and lichen specifically adapted to grow on their bodies. Camouflage lichen is the most common variety of these oread plants. It takes 1 minute to apply a paste of camouflage lichen spores to the skin, and an additional 24 hours for the fungus to sprout. After this time, the oread is covered in a thin green layer of living plant matter, granting her a +4 bonus on Stealth checks made in green forest and jungle environments. Red-orange and white varieties exist, providing bonuses in appropriately colored environments (red-orange among autumn leaves or in red deserts, white in snow, and so on). Camouflage lichen has a short lifespan; it withers and dies 3 days after being applied, crumbling away into harmless powder.

Some may have one or more smaller pockets on the sides.<br/><br/> <i>Masterwork Backpack</i>: This backpack has numerous pockets for storing items that might be needed while adventuring. Hooks are included for attaching items such as canteens, pouches, or even a rolled-up blanket. It has padded bands that strap across the chest and the waist to distribute its weight more evenly. Like a common backpack, it can hold about 2 cubic feet of material in its main container. When wearing a masterwork backpack, treat your Strength score as +1 higher than normal when calculating your carrying capacity.<br/><br/><i>Carrier Backpack</i>: Reinforced metal bars allow for this leather backpack to withstand a greater degree of stress than a traditional pack. Along with the standard backpack compartment, this pack has an additional pouch and harness at its top. Used together, the harness and pouch can safely contain a Tiny or smaller creature. While harnessed, the creature can't leave the backpack or see outside of it; it takes a full-round action to remove the harness from a carried creature.<br/><br/><i>Hydration Backpack</i>: This mostly leather backpack has a series of awkward metallic tubes, which run from the pack over your shoulders, and a small bladder at its base. A hydration backpack has a large pocket identical to that of a regular backpack that holds 2 cubic feet of material, while the bladder holds 1 gallon of liquid. The ends of the metal tubes can be positioned to allow you to easily dispense and drink liquid stored in the attached bladder. Consuming water in this way grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Constitution checks to avoid nonlethal damage during a forced march.<br/><br/><i>Weaponrack Backpack</i>: This leather backpack includes a small weapons rack.

A manacled creature can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles).

For a Large creature, manacles cost 10 times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, 100 times the indicated amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made manacles, which cost at least 100 times the indicated amount.<br/><br/>Mithral Manacles: These bindings are more difficult to break than standard manacles and are particularly useful against lycanthropes. They have hardness 15, 30 hit points, and a break DC of 30. They are otherwise treated as masterwork manacles.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Expanded Information</h2><p><strong>Source</strong>: <em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Path of the Hellknight pg.15</em><br/><br/>Manacles are detailed on page 68 of <em>Ultimate Equipment</em>. The specifics of their effects are largely left to the GM's discretion, due in large part to manacles' versatility. However, for their most common uses, GMs might employ the following effects.<br/><br/> <strong>Fetters</strong>: These manacles are specifically designed to fit around the ankles, and use the same rules for breaking, escape, and cost relative to size. A creature in fetters is entangled and can move at only half speed. In addition, a fettered creature must succeed at a DC 15 Acrobatics check to move more than its (reduced) speed in a round. If it fails the check by 5 or more, the creature falls prone.<br/><br/> <strong>Frontal Restraint</strong>: A creature whose wrists are bound with manacles can wield only one melee weapon or shield in combat (the weapon may be a two-handed weapon). It cannot make use of ranged weapons, except for crossbows (but even these cannot be reloaded by the bound creature). Any attack the creature makes while manacled takes a -4 penalty. The creature can attempt skill checks using its hands, but at a -5 penalty (-15 on Disable Device checks to pick the lock of manacles the creature is wearing).<br/><br/> <strong>Rear Restraint</strong>: Manacles might be employed to keep a creature's hands behind its back. In such cases, the creature cannot use its hands to effectively employ any weapon or shield. The creature can attempt to use its hands to perform a skill, but at a -10 penalty (-25 on Disable Device checks to pick the lock of manacles the creature is wearing). While manacled, a creature can attempt to flip its arms beneath its legs, bringing its hands in front of itself. This requires a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check (a separate Escape Artist check is then required to escape the manacles).<br/><br/> <strong>Restraining Two Individuals</strong>: Two creatures might share one set of manacles. While manacled together, the manacled individuals must remain adjacent to one another. If they are not working together, they are both treated as grappled. If they are working together, they can move together in the same round (using the movement speed of the slower creature). A manacled creature can forfeit its turn during combat to mimic the other manacled creature's movements, allowing that creature to act as if unrestrained.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":3},"price":50,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"manaclesMasterwork","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428366431,"modifiedTime":1677435522639,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Hooks are included for attaching items such as canteens, pouches, or even a rolled-up blanket. It has padded bands that strap across the chest and the waist to distribute its weight more evenly. Like a common backpack, it can hold about 2 cubic feet of material in its main container. When wearing a masterwork backpack, treat your Strength score as +1 higher than normal when calculating your carrying capacity.<br/><br/><i>Carrier Backpack</i>: Reinforced metal bars allow for this leather backpack to withstand a greater degree of stress than a traditional pack. Along with the standard backpack compartment, this pack has an additional pouch and harness at its top. Used together, the harness and pouch can safely contain a Tiny or smaller creature. While harnessed, the creature can't leave the backpack or see outside of it; it takes a full-round action to remove the harness from a carried creature.<br/><br/><i>Hydration Backpack</i>: This mostly leather backpack has a series of awkward metallic tubes, which run from the pack over your shoulders, and a small bladder at its base. A hydration backpack has a large pocket identical to that of a regular backpack that holds 2 cubic feet of material, while the bladder holds 1 gallon of liquid. The ends of the metal tubes can be positioned to allow you to easily dispense and drink liquid stored in the attached bladder. Consuming water in this way grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Constitution checks to avoid nonlethal damage during a forced march.<br/><br/><i>Weaponrack Backpack</i>: This leather backpack includes a small weapons rack. The rack holds up to four weapons, such as battleaxes, longswords, maces, or short swords. Allies adjacent to you can retrieve a weapon from the rack as a move action without provoking attacks of opportunity, as if they were simply drawing a weapon.

When injected into a mostly intact corpse of a Medium or smaller creature that has been dead for no more than 1 day (time spent under effects like <em>gentle repose</em> don't count against this time), the fluid gives the corpse a rudimentary semblance of life, reactivating its nerves and muscle tissue. This causes the corpse to reanimate and shamble around erratically for 1 minute. The result is not an undead creature, nor is it a construct. The reanimated corpse remains utterly lifeless and is driven only by muscular spasms that cause it shuffle 20 feet in a random direction each round, gasping and blinking eerily as it goes. When the corpse hits a solid barrier or is attacked, it stops moving. On its next turn, roll 1d8 to determine where it goes next. On a 1, it continues forward in the same direction it had been previously moving (or runs up against the same barrier). On a 2, it turns 45* clockwise and heads in that direction; on a 3, it turns 90* clockwise and heads in that direction; and so on. The corpse can't attack, doesn't defend itself, and-as an object-has AC 10 and 12 hit points.

Hooks are included for attaching items such as canteens, pouches, or even a rolled-up blanket. It has padded bands that strap across the chest and the waist to distribute its weight more evenly.

Along with the standard backpack compartment, this pack has an additional pouch and harness at its top. Used together, the harness and pouch can safely contain a Tiny or smaller creature. While harnessed, the creature can't leave the backpack or see outside of it; it takes a full-round action to remove the harness from a carried creature.<br/><br/><i>Hydration Backpack</i>: This mostly leather backpack has a series of awkward metallic tubes, which run from the pack over your shoulders, and a small bladder at its base. A hydration backpack has a large pocket identical to that of a regular backpack that holds 2 cubic feet of material, while the bladder holds 1 gallon of liquid. The ends of the metal tubes can be positioned to allow you to easily dispense and drink liquid stored in the attached bladder. Consuming water in this way grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Constitution checks to avoid nonlethal damage during a forced march.<br/><br/><i>Weaponrack Backpack</i>: This leather backpack includes a small weapons rack. The rack holds up to four weapons, such as battleaxes, longswords, maces, or short swords. Allies adjacent to you can retrieve a weapon from the rack as a move action without provoking attacks of opportunity, as if they were simply drawing a weapon.

A candle made from alchemical candle wax normally possesses a sweet, honeylike smell, but a character who is trained in Craft (alchemy) can infuse the wax with nearly any scent available to her. A character trained in both Craft (alchemy) and Craft (poison) can infuse one candle's worth of wax with any alchemical substance that requires inhalation, such as a vial of alchemical pheromones (see below) or a dose of inhaled poison. When infusing the wax with poison, the normal rules for exposing oneself to poison apply. Only one kind of alchemical substance can be infused into a single candle at a time, though a single candle can hold up to 3 doses of a substance.

Creating a dose of antivenom requires a dose of the specific poison that the antivenom is designed to protect against.<br/><br/> <strong>Antivenom Effects</strong>: A single dose of antivenom automatically neutralizes the first exposure of the specific poison it is made to combat and provides a +8 alchemical bonus on saving throws against additional exposure to that specific poison; this bonus decreases by 1 every hour, until the effect ends after 8 hours.<br/><br/> <strong>Crafting Antivenom</strong>: To create a dose of antivenom, a living creature must first be exposed to a half dose of the poison in question. The creature suffers the poison's effects normally, except the saving throw DC to resist the poison is reduced by 2. In order to be able to produce antivenom, the creature must succeed at the necessary saving throws to be cured of the poison. If the poison's duration expires without the creature being cured, no antivenom can be harvested. Once the creature has resisted the poison's effects, a viable sample of the creature's blood can be extracted with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) or Heal check. This blood must then be refined to extract the natural antibodies that combat the poison in a process that takes 1 hour and requires a successful Craft (alchemy) check (DC = 5 + the poison's saving throw DC). Success yields 1 dose of antivenom. Antivenom can also be harvested in the same fashion from a creature that has been afflicted by a full dose of poison, rather than a creature deliberately given a half dose for this purpose. Regardless of how much poison the creature is exposed to, the antibodies in its system can be harvested only for 24 hours after it has recovered from the poison.<br/><br/> <strong>Purchasing Antivenom</strong>: Antivenom is not particularly expensive, but because it is highly specialized, it can be difficult to find. A dose of antivenom has a market price equal to half the market price of a dose of the poison in question, but it is treated as though its price were five times the market price of the poison for the purposes of determining its availability in any given settlement. Alternatively, if 1 or more doses of the poison in question can be provided, most alchemists will supply as much antivenom as they can produce from the doses for a fee of 10% of the market price of the poison.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC varies</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"antivenom","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Remedies"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"potion","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428366720,"modifiedTime":1677435526999,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Some may have one or more smaller pockets on the sides.<br/><br/> <i>Masterwork Backpack</i>: This backpack has numerous pockets for storing items that might be needed while adventuring. Hooks are included for attaching items such as canteens, pouches, or even a rolled-up blanket. It has padded bands that strap across the chest and the waist to distribute its weight more evenly. Like a common backpack, it can hold about 2 cubic feet of material in its main container. When wearing a masterwork backpack, treat your Strength score as +1 higher than normal when calculating your carrying capacity.<br/><br/><i>Carrier Backpack</i>: Reinforced metal bars allow for this leather backpack to withstand a greater degree of stress than a traditional pack. Along with the standard backpack compartment, this pack has an additional pouch and harness at its top. Used together, the harness and pouch can safely contain a Tiny or smaller creature. While harnessed, the creature can't leave the backpack or see outside of it; it takes a full-round action to remove the harness from a carried creature.<br/><br/><i>Hydration Backpack</i>: This mostly leather backpack has a series of awkward metallic tubes, which run from the pack over your shoulders, and a small bladder at its base. A hydration backpack has a large pocket identical to that of a regular backpack that holds 2 cubic feet of material, while the bladder holds 1 gallon of liquid. The ends of the metal tubes can be positioned to allow you to easily dispense and drink liquid stored in the attached bladder. Consuming water in this way grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Constitution checks to avoid nonlethal damage during a forced march.<br/><br/><i>Weaponrack Backpack</i>: This leather backpack includes a small weapons rack. The rack holds up to four weapons, such as battleaxes, longswords, maces, or short swords. Allies adjacent to you can retrieve a weapon from the rack as a move action without provoking attacks of opportunity, as if they were simply drawing a weapon. Like a normal backpack, it can hold 2 cubic feet of material in its main compartment.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":5},"price":2,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":"","basePrice":0},"identifiedName":"Backpack","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"inventoryItems":[],"maxWeight":null,"weightReduction":0,"sellMultiplier":0.5,"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"basePrice":0,"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428366753,"modifiedTime":1677435523010,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The glue is sufficient to coat 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 40 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each. Pulling apart a large glued surface (at least 1 square foot) requires a DC 15 Strength check. Pulling apart a small glued surface (anything less than 1 square foot) requires a DC 10 Strength check.

These pheromones combine the natural scent of an animal (such as a wolf), humanoid (such as a human), magical beast (such as a unicorn), or vermin (such as a centipede) with alchemical reagents that enhance and refine that scent, making the concoction potent enough to modify the behavior of a creature. A dose of alchemical pheromones must be created for the animal, magical beast, or vermin type or for a single subtype of humanoid; it typically affects only creatures of that type or subtype. The effects of the alchemical pheromone depend on the type.<br/><br/> When it is smeared onto a surface or it is thrown as a splash weapon, the alchemical pheromone fills a 5-foot-radius area with its scent. The scent then remains active for 1 minute. A creature of the targeted type or subtype that enters that area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be subject to the effects of the pheromone for 1 round. If the creature remains in the affected area, it must attempt a new saving throw each round as long as the pheromone remains active. All alchemical pheromones are mind-affecting effects, but swarms (as well as any other collection of creatures that acts as a single creature) are not immune to them. Creatures that don't need to breathe are immune to alchemical pheromones, while creatures with the scent ability take a -4 penalty on saving throws against them.<br/><br/> <strong>Aggression</strong>: Affected creatures are driven into a mindless frenzy, as if affected by simultaneous <em>confusion</em> and <em>rage</em> spells.<br/><br/> <strong>Arousal</strong>: Affected creatures are aroused and distracted, causing them to lose their Dexterity bonus to AC.<br/><br/> <strong>Simple</strong>: An affected creature is staggered for 1 round.

On a failure by 5 or more, the leaves become torn and ruined. If gloves or gauntlets aren't worn, the preparer is automatically exposed to the goblinvine's effects. If the preparation check's result is a natural 1, the preparer is exposed to those effects regardless of any hand protection worn. The goblin vine must then be stored in an area of bright light for at least 1 hour for the inner surface of the leaves to properly 'sweat' and build up enough irritating oil to function as a thrown weapon.<br/><strong>Use</strong> Once woven into a tight ball of vines and left to sweat, a ball of goblinvine leaves can be used as an improvised thrown weapon as a ranged touch attack. On a hit, a target must succeed at a DC 10 Fortitude save or develop a distracting, itchy rash that imposes a -2 penalty on ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. This effect persists for 10 minutes or until the rash is tended with a successful DC 12 Heal check attempted as a full-round action. This is a poison effect, but creatures with the goblinoid subtype are immune to the effect. Innovative characters (including many goblins) have developed other uses for goblinvine, including as snares and ropes to make those bound or entangled itchy as well, but since goblinvine is relatively fragile, it makes for a very poor substitute for rope.</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbolN.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"The herbalism subsystem is not legal for play; instead a PC with at least one rank in Craft (alchemy) and 1 rank in either Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) can purchase the herbs in this book at a 10% discount that does not stack with other discounts; if a PC's ranks in these skills are 5 or higher, the discount increases to 15%, and if a PC's ranks in these skills are 10 or higher, the discount increases to 20%\"/>Description</h2><p>The leaves of this invasive creeper are wide and covered with tiny hairlike filaments.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":30,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"goblinvine","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Herbs"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428366776,"modifiedTime":1677435527001,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Spinning the wheel is part of the normal action required to activate the scroll (usually a standard action or the spell's casting time, whichever is longer). Using the wheel to activate a scroll provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as activating a scroll (or casting the spell) normally would. The wheel can hold only one divine scroll at a time.

A kiss delivers the full dose of the poison, and that application of poison lip paint then becomes nonpoisonous. To use poison lip paint without being exposed to the poison, the wearer must first apply a protective layer of base material. When using an ingested poison, the wearer can instead consume an antidote prior to application. (When the user applies a contact poison, preemptively consuming an antidote results in the wearer's skin harmlessly absorbing the poison, as does immunity to poison.)

When this item is hooked onto a rope or a similar object that has been fastened at a downward angle, the owner can use it to climb down the rope at a speed of 30 feet as a move action instead of climbing at her normal speed, but the user must take at least one move action doing so each round or she falls. Using a zip-line hook in this way requires a successful DC 5 Climb check for declinations of 90 degrees (straight down), increasing by 5 for every 15 degrees off that baseline in either direction, to a maximum DC of 30 at a 15- or 165-degree declination. It is impossible to utilize a zip-line hook on a rope without a slope, or to ascend an upward-sloping one.<br/><br/> Zip-line hooks are designed for use with two hands. A character can use a zip-line hook one-handed, but if she does so, she takes a -8 penalty on her Climb checks. Moving via a zip line is considered rigorous motion for the purpose of casting spells. If a zip line or its rope becomes broken while in use, the character using the zip line falls.<br/><br/> A zip-line hook can be improvised from cloth, leather, or any flexible hook-shaped object. Each time the character uses a move action to move with an improvised zip-line hook, the hook takes 1d6 points of damage from friction. A masterwork zip-line hook grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks to descend a rope.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":55,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"ziplineHook","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428366853,"modifiedTime":1677435523100,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

This greater splash weapon deals no damage, but those within its primary area of effect-the target and those within 5 feet of the target or those within 5 feet of the intersection-must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Greater Splash Weapon</h2><p>This splash weapon works in some ways like a normal splash weapon (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 202), but its effects cover a larger area. Like a normal splash weapon, a greater splash weapon requires no weapon proficiency, and you throw it by making a ranged touch attack. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target and to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of that target. It then deals splash damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the target. If the target takes up more than a 5-foot square, you can chose one of its squares as the center of the effect. The direct damage affects the squares normally, so a Large or larger creature could take both the direct damage and the splash damage depending on the square you choose. The splash damage for a greater splash weapon is 5 points of the appropriate damage type for the weapon.<br/><br/> Like a normal splash weapon, you can also choose to target a specific grid intersection (treating it as a ranged attack against AC 5). If it hits, the greater splash weapon deals direct damage to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of the targeted intersection, and splash damage to creatures within 10 feet of the targeted intersection. As with a normal splash weapon, you cannot target a grid intersection occupied by a creature.<br/><br/> Greater splash weapons can be thrown as if they were a rock using the rock throwing universal monster rule (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 303), and caught with rock catching (<i>Bestiary</i> 303), though the DC to catch a greater splash weapon is 10 higher than normal due to its fragile and volatile nature. If a creature fails its Reflex saving throw to catch a greater splash weapon, the weapon automatically breaks, treating the creature attempting to catch it as the splash weapon's target.<br/><br/> A greater splash weapon can be used only by Large or larger creatures, though it can be used as ammunition in a catapult or trebuchet. When used as ammunition in one of these siege engines, use the range for the engine rather than the greater splash weapon's range.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><b>Craft (Alchemy)</b> DC 35</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":25},"price":150,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[{"_id":"4r9z8ch0y2fffxns","name":"Use","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/unique-3.jpg","description":"","tag":"noxiousPig","activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":"40","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"autoDeductChargesCost":"","self":{"value":0,"maxFormula":"","per":null},"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"rsak","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[["",{"values":[],"custom":""}],["",{"values":[],"custom":""}]],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":""},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"20","type":"fort","description":""},"effectNotes":["see text"],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"naturalAttack":{"primaryAttack":true,"secondary":{"attackBonus":"-5","damageMult":0.5}},"nonlethal":false,"usesAmmo":false,"spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","conditionals":[],"enh":{"value":null}}],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"noxiousPig","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Weapons"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"range":{"value":"40","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"measureTemplate":{"size":"0"},"actionType":"rsak","damage":{"parts":[["",""],["",""]]},"ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"20","type":"fort"},"attack":{}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428366866,"modifiedTime":1677435527004,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

When poured over water, the oil pools on the surface and takes 1 round to spread out from the point of origin in a 20-foot radius. At the end of this round, the cardice oil flash-freezes the surface of the water, creating an ice sheet over the affected area (<em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook </em>430). Any 5-foot square of this ice can support up to 200 pounds of weight. Weight in excess of this amount causes the entire sheet to crack and quickly break up. This ice sheet becomes unstable and breaks up on its own after 1 hour, or 20 minutes in a hot climate. Any creature whose bare skin comes in contact with cardice oil takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage each round because of the chemical's volatile nature, but the oil is ineffective as a splash weapon.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 25</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":50,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Cardice Oil","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"cardiceOil","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"potion","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428366874,"modifiedTime":1677435527004,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The wearer becomes difficult to identify, as the mask obscures all facial features. A creature wearing an iron mask is always treated as having made an involuntary Disguise skill check with a result of 10 (with no further modifiers). Additionally, the creature can only apply half its Dexterity modifier to Dexterity checks, Dexterity- based skill checks, initiative checks, and Reflex saving throws. The creature adds only half of its Dexterity modifier to its Armor Class and CMD, and to attack rolls, if applicable. The creature treats all other creatures as if they had concealment against it.<br/><br/> A creature wearing an iron mask can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 35, or DC 40 for a masterwork iron mask). Breaking the mask requires a Strength check (DC 30, or DC 32 for a masterwork iron mask). An iron mask has hardness 10 and 30 hit points. Half the damage dealt to an iron mask applies to the creature wearing it.<br/><br/> Iron masks are typically designed for Medium creatures, but Small ones can be bought for the same price, or larger ones can be bought for higher prices (the price is calculated the same way as buying larger-sized manacles; see page 68 of <em>Ultimate Equipment</em>). Most iron masks have locks; add the cost of the desired lock to the price of the mask.

Arranging the struts into a wing or reversing the change is a move action. When the cloak is shaped into a wing, the wearer can make a DC 15 Fly check to fall safely from any height without taking falling damage, as if using <em>feather fall</em>. When falling, the wearer may make an additional DC 15 Fly check to glide, moving 5 feet laterally for every 20 feet she falls. Readying and using a wing cloak requires two hands and provokes an attack of opportunity. A wing cloak has hardness 0 and 5 hit points. If the wing cloak is broken, the Fly DCs to use it increase by +10.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":1200,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"wingCloak","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"clothing","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"shoulders","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428366911,"modifiedTime":1677435527006,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

These pheromones combine the natural scent of an animal (such as a wolf), humanoid (such as a human), magical beast (such as a unicorn), or vermin (such as a centipede) with alchemical reagents that enhance and refine that scent, making the concoction potent enough to modify the behavior of a creature. A dose of alchemical pheromones must be created for the animal, magical beast, or vermin type or for a single subtype of humanoid; it typically affects only creatures of that type or subtype. The effects of the alchemical pheromone depend on the type.<br/><br/> When it is smeared onto a surface or it is thrown as a splash weapon, the alchemical pheromone fills a 5-foot-radius area with its scent. The scent then remains active for 1 minute. A creature of the targeted type or subtype that enters that area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be subject to the effects of the pheromone for 1 round. If the creature remains in the affected area, it must attempt a new saving throw each round as long as the pheromone remains active. All alchemical pheromones are mind-affecting effects, but swarms (as well as any other collection of creatures that acts as a single creature) are not immune to them. Creatures that don't need to breathe are immune to alchemical pheromones, while creatures with the scent ability take a -4 penalty on saving throws against them.<br/><br/> <strong>Aggression</strong>: Affected creatures are driven into a mindless frenzy, as if affected by simultaneous <em>confusion</em> and <em>rage</em> spells.<br/><br/> <strong>Arousal</strong>: Affected creatures are aroused and distracted, causing them to lose their Dexterity bonus to AC.<br/><br/> <strong>Simple</strong>: An affected creature is staggered for 1 round. Whether the target succeeds at or fails the saving throw, it becomes immune to simple alchemical pheromones for 24 hours.<br/><br/> <strong>Susceptibility</strong>: Affected creatures are forced to obey one specific, simple command, as if affected by a <em>command</em> spell. The command is chosen when the pheromone is created, and must be a something simple, such as approach, drop, fall, flee, or halt (as defined by the <em>command</em> spell).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":1,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Alchemical Pheromones (Simple)","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"alchemicalPheromonesSimple","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428367128,"modifiedTime":1677435527007,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

A blanch bomb is effective only against a target that is vulnerable to the type of blanch bomb employed against it. A blanch bomb is thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon contact with a hard surface, the blanch bomb releases a hazy cloud of gas within a 10-foot-radius burst centered on the point of impact. This cloud lasts for 1d4+1 rounds and can be dispersed as fog cloud. If a creature whose damage reduction is overcome by the specified substance begins its turn in the affected area, the subject's DR/adamantine, DR/cold iron, or DR/silver (depending on the type of blanch bomb used) degrades at a rate of 1 point per round for as long as the creature remains in the area (to a minimum of DR 0). If the subject ends its turn outside the affected area, the creature's damage reduction returns to its original amount at a rate of 1 point per round.<br/><br/> <b>Mythic</b>: You can expend one use of mythic power while throwing a blanch bomb to infuse the item with mythic power. When the blanch bomb activates, creatures in the area with the matching DR vulnerability must succeed at DC 16 Reflex saves or their DR is immediately reduced by an amount equal to 1/2 your mythic tier. The gas created by the blanch bomb lasts an additional number of rounds equal to your mythic tier, and it cannot be dispersed by wind.

A shield boss can be added to a buckler, light steel or wooden shield, or heavy steel or wooden shield. Tower shields are too large for a typical shield boss, though one can be crafted to fit a tower shield for an additional 300 gp. Attaching or removing a shield boss requires 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 15 Craft (armor) check; on a failure, the shield boss is not successfully attached or removed and the shield takes 1d6 points of damage that bypasses any hardness.<br/><br/> A reinforcing boss provides extra protection to a shield, increasing the shield's current and maximum hit points by 10. The boss makes the shield 10 pounds heavier and more unwieldy-if the shield imposes a penalty on attack rolls, as do bucklers and tower shields, the penalty increases by 1. Common improvements to the basic reinforcing boss include the following.<br/><br/> <strong>Breakaway Boss</strong>: The metal stud at the center of the reinforcing boss holds a compartment large enough to insert a single splash weapon, such as a vial of acid or alchemist's fire, as a full-round action. On a successful shield bash attack, the weapon vial breaks and deals damage to the target as though it were directly hit by the splash weapon. The shield takes the normal amount of splash damage for being adjacent to the target, but no other creatures adjacent to the target take splash damage from this effect. A new splash weapon must be inserted into the breakaway boss for it to be used again.<br/><br/> <strong>Hooked Boss</strong>: The struts on this reinforcing boss bear large, sturdy hooks, which can be used to snag an opponent's clothing or armor, causing it to stumble. You can attempt trip combat maneuver checks with this shield. If the combat maneuver check is successful, the opponent does not fall prone, but is considered flat-footed until the beginning of its next turn.<br/><br/> <strong>Illuminating Boss</strong>: The stud at the center of this reinforcing boss contains a covered slot large enough to insert a sunrod. Installing a lit sunrod into an illuminating boss is a full-round action. If you shake the shield firmly as a move action, you can flip a metal flap fitted over the slot to conceal or reveal the sunrod's glow.<br/><br/> <strong>Masterwork Boss</strong>: Any of the bosses listed above, including the basic reinforcing boss, can be masterwork. A masterwork reinforcing boss increases the shield's current and maximum hit points by 15 instead of 10 and doesn't increase the attack roll penalty.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":13},"price":50,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"shieldBossMasterwork","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428367177,"modifiedTime":1677435523460,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Regardless, any creature that spends more than 1 round eating the carrion bait quickly realizes its error, since the bait continues to swell and grow even as it's digested. One round after eating carrion bait, an affected undead or vermin becomes staggered for 1d4 rounds as its belly bulges to incredible proportions (other creature types cannot stomach carrion bait and instead are nauseated for 2d4 rounds). If the affected creature is already staggered, its movement speed instead decreases by 10 feet for the duration of the carrion bait's effect. Crafting carrion bait requires a successful DC 19 Craft (alchemy) check.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 19</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2},"price":25,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"carrionBait","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428367196,"modifiedTime":1677435527010,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The sturdy container features a padded interior with numerous straps and compartments so that the items within aren't damaged in transport. The altar's surface prominently features a deity's holy symbol, and it's sturdy enough that it can support up to 300 pounds of weight, enough to serve as a makeshift pulpit.<br/><br/> Among the items found within the altar are the tools and materials necessary to perform not just ceremonies, but also jobs and professions the related deity deems sacred, as well as holy texts written to inspire greatness in the deity's followers. The user can expend some of the materials within the altar to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the next Craft check of the specified type (see below).<br/><br/> In addition, after spending 1 hour praying and reading the holy scriptures within the altar, the user gains a +2 circumstance bonus on a single skill check. Which deity this altar is dedicated to determines the skill to which this bonus applies (see below). The user must attempt this skill check within an hour of praying and reading the altar's scriptures or lose the bonus-the mantras and inspiration provided by the texts having drifted from her mind. This hour of prayer and scripture reading can be integrated with the time a cleric uses to prepare her spells. Regardless, using the masterwork portable altar in this manner expends the altar's materials in the same way that using the normal altar to bolster a Craft check does.<br/><br/> A masterwork portable altar can be used multiple times, but after 20 uses, it must be restocked with 50 gp worth of sanctified materials-preferably purchased from a temple of the associated deity. The altar grants no bonuses on skill checks if used while its materials are depleted, though it can still be employed as a normal portable altar.<br/><br/> <table class=\"inner\"><tr><td><strong>Deity</strong></td><td><strong>Favored Craft</strong></td><td><strong>Aided Skill</strong></td><tr> <tr><td>Abadar</td><td>Craft (jewelry)</td><td>Appraise</td><tr> <tr><td>Asmodeus</td><td>Craft (calligraphy)</td><td>Diplomacy</td><tr> <tr><td>Calistria</td><td>Craft (traps)</td><td>Bluff</td><tr> <tr><td>Cayden Cailean</td><td>Craft (leather)</td><td>Ride</td><tr> <tr><td>Desna</td><td>Craft (clothing)</td><td>Perception</td><tr> <tr><td>Erastil</td><td>Craft (bows)</td><td>Survival</td><tr> <tr><td>Gorum</td><td>Craft (armor)</td><td>Intimidate</td><tr> <tr><td>Gozreh</td><td>Craft (ships)</td><td>Handle Animal</td><tr> <tr><td>Iomedae</td><td>Craft (armor)</td><td>Diplomacy</td><tr> <tr><td>Irori</td><td>Craft (books)</td><td>Acrobatics</td><tr> <tr><td>Lamashtu</td><td>Craft (traps)</td><td>Intimidate</td><tr> <tr><td>Nethys</td><td>Craft (books)</td><td>Spellcraft</td><tr> <tr><td>Norgorber</td><td>Craft (alchemy)</td><td>Stealth</td><tr> <tr><td>Pharasma</td><td>Craft (pottery)</td><td>Perception</td><tr> <tr><td>Rovagug</td><td>Craft (weapons)</td><td>Intimidate</td><tr> <tr><td>Sarenrae</td><td>Craft (weapons)</td><td>Heal</td><tr> <tr><td>Shelyn</td><td>Craft (any art)</td><td>Perform (any)</td><tr> <tr><td>Torag</td><td>Craft (stonemasonry)</td><td>Climb</td><tr> <tr><td>Urgathoa</td><td>Craft (alchemy)</td><td>Disguise</td><tr> <tr><td>Zon-Kuthon</td><td>Craft (locks)</td><td>Stealth</td><tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></table></p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":40},"price":400,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Altar, Portable (masterwork)","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"altarPortableMasterwork","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428367232,"modifiedTime":1677435523504,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Using a zip-line hook in this way requires a successful DC 5 Climb check for declinations of 90 degrees (straight down), increasing by 5 for every 15 degrees off that baseline in either direction, to a maximum DC of 30 at a 15- or 165-degree declination. It is impossible to utilize a zip-line hook on a rope without a slope, or to ascend an upward-sloping one.<br/><br/> Zip-line hooks are designed for use with two hands. A character can use a zip-line hook one-handed, but if she does so, she takes a -8 penalty on her Climb checks. Moving via a zip line is considered rigorous motion for the purpose of casting spells. If a zip line or its rope becomes broken while in use, the character using the zip line falls.<br/><br/> A zip-line hook can be improvised from cloth, leather, or any flexible hook-shaped object. Each time the character uses a move action to move with an improvised zip-line hook, the hook takes 1d6 points of damage from friction.

(reinforcing boss)</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Description</h2><p>A shield boss is a sturdy steel device that fastens to the front of a shield, providing metal support struts that radiate outward from the center of the shield, reinforcing its structure. A shield boss can be added to a buckler, light steel or wooden shield, or heavy steel or wooden shield. Tower shields are too large for a typical shield boss, though one can be crafted to fit a tower shield for an additional 300 gp. Attaching or removing a shield boss requires 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 15 Craft (armor) check; on a failure, the shield boss is not successfully attached or removed and the shield takes 1d6 points of damage that bypasses any hardness.<br/><br/> A reinforcing boss provides extra protection to a shield, increasing the shield's current and maximum hit points by 10. The boss makes the shield 10 pounds heavier and more unwieldy-if the shield imposes a penalty on attack rolls, as do bucklers and tower shields, the penalty increases by 1. Common improvements to the basic reinforcing boss include the following.<br/><br/> <strong>Breakaway Boss</strong>: The metal stud at the center of the reinforcing boss holds a compartment large enough to insert a single splash weapon, such as a vial of acid or alchemist's fire, as a full-round action. On a successful shield bash attack, the weapon vial breaks and deals damage to the target as though it were directly hit by the splash weapon. The shield takes the normal amount of splash damage for being adjacent to the target, but no other creatures adjacent to the target take splash damage from this effect. A new splash weapon must be inserted into the breakaway boss for it to be used again.<br/><br/> <strong>Hooked Boss</strong>: The struts on this reinforcing boss bear large, sturdy hooks, which can be used to snag an opponent's clothing or armor, causing it to stumble. You can attempt trip combat maneuver checks with this shield. If the combat maneuver check is successful, the opponent does not fall prone, but is considered flat-footed until the beginning of its next turn.<br/><br/> <strong>Illuminating Boss</strong>: The stud at the center of this reinforcing boss contains a covered slot large enough to insert a sunrod. Installing a lit sunrod into an illuminating boss is a full-round action. If you shake the shield firmly as a move action, you can flip a metal flap fitted over the slot to conceal or reveal the sunrod's glow.<br/><br/> <strong>Masterwork Boss</strong>: Any of the bosses listed above, including the basic reinforcing boss, can be masterwork. A masterwork reinforcing boss increases the shield's current and maximum hit points by 15 instead of 10 and doesn't increase the attack roll penalty.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":14},"price":30,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"shieldBossReinforcingBoss","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428367288,"modifiedTime":1677435523562,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

A blanch bomb is effective only against a target that is vulnerable to the type of blanch bomb employed against it. A blanch bomb is thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. Upon contact with a hard surface, the blanch bomb releases a hazy cloud of gas within a 10-foot-radius burst centered on the point of impact. This cloud lasts for 1d4+1 rounds and can be dispersed as fog cloud. If a creature whose damage reduction is overcome by the specified substance begins its turn in the affected area, the subject's DR/adamantine, DR/cold iron, or DR/silver (depending on the type of blanch bomb used) degrades at a rate of 1 point per round for as long as the creature remains in the area (to a minimum of DR 0). If the subject ends its turn outside the affected area, the creature's damage reduction returns to its original amount at a rate of 1 point per round.<br/><br/> <b>Mythic</b>: You can expend one use of mythic power while throwing a blanch bomb to infuse the item with mythic power. When the blanch bomb activates, creatures in the area with the matching DR vulnerability must succeed at DC 16 Reflex saves or their DR is immediately reduced by an amount equal to 1/2 your mythic tier. The gas created by the blanch bomb lasts an additional number of rounds equal to your mythic tier, and it cannot be dispersed by wind. Non-mythic subjects who leave the affected area regain their DR at a rate of 1 point per minute.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Alchemical Recipe</h2><p><b>Recipe</b> (100 cold iron + 50 phosphorus + 20 saltpeter)/congelation; <b>Craft</b> 25<br/><b>Time</b> 1 hour; <b>Tools</b> crucible; <b>Type</b> alchemical weapon</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0.5},"price":150,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[{"_id":"ku1xlowju7jgv86b","name":"Use","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/magic-blue.jpg","description":"","tag":"blanchBombColdIron","activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":"10","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"autoDeductChargesCost":"","self":{"value":0,"maxFormula":"","per":null},"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"circle","size":"11","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"rsak","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[["",{"values":[],"custom":""}],["",{"values":[],"custom":""}]],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":""},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":["see text"],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"naturalAttack":{"primaryAttack":true,"secondary":{"attackBonus":"-5","damageMult":0.5}},"nonlethal":false,"usesAmmo":false,"spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","conditionals":[],"enh":{"value":null}}],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"blanchBombColdIron","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Weapons"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"range":{"value":"10","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"measureTemplate":{"type":"circle","size":"11"},"actionType":"rsak","damage":{"parts":[["",""],["",""]]},"ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"0","type":""},"attack":{}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428367292,"modifiedTime":1677435527013,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

For example, just because a certain perfume is favored by local nobles (granting a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks to influence them) doesn't mean that perfume has the same effect on a member of the thieves' guild, a foreign berserker, or a medusa. Likewise, just because a fake beard woven by dwarves out of the beards of famous dwarves may grant a +2 circumstance bonus on Use Magic Device checks to emulate the dwarven race doesn't mean the beard has any effect on using that skill to activate elven items or paladin items, or to decipher a written spell.<br/><br/> Individual GMs may want to allow masterwork tools for other skills at the listed cost. The circumstance bonus for such a tool should never be more than +2. The tool should either have a limited number of uses (such as the disguise and healer's kits) or only apply to certain aspects of the skill (such as the balancing pole's bonus on Acrobatics checks to traverse a narrow surface or the magnifying glass's bonus on Appraise checks for detailed items).</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":50,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"masterworkTool","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428367324,"modifiedTime":1677435523601,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

A manacled creature can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles).

For a Large creature, manacles cost 10 times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, 100 times the indicated amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made manacles, which cost at least 100 times the indicated amount.<br/><br/>Mithral Manacles: These bindings are more difficult to break than standard manacles and are particularly useful against lycanthropes. They have hardness 15, 30 hit points, and a break DC of 30. They are otherwise treated as masterwork manacles.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Expanded Information</h2><p><strong>Source</strong>: <em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Path of the Hellknight pg.15</em><br/><br/>Manacles are detailed on page 68 of <em>Ultimate Equipment</em>. The specifics of their effects are largely left to the GM's discretion, due in large part to manacles' versatility. However, for their most common uses, GMs might employ the following effects.<br/><br/> <strong>Fetters</strong>: These manacles are specifically designed to fit around the ankles, and use the same rules for breaking, escape, and cost relative to size. A creature in fetters is entangled and can move at only half speed. In addition, a fettered creature must succeed at a DC 15 Acrobatics check to move more than its (reduced) speed in a round. If it fails the check by 5 or more, the creature falls prone.<br/><br/> <strong>Frontal Restraint</strong>: A creature whose wrists are bound with manacles can wield only one melee weapon or shield in combat (the weapon may be a two-handed weapon). It cannot make use of ranged weapons, except for crossbows (but even these cannot be reloaded by the bound creature). Any attack the creature makes while manacled takes a -4 penalty. The creature can attempt skill checks using its hands, but at a -5 penalty (-15 on Disable Device checks to pick the lock of manacles the creature is wearing).<br/><br/> <strong>Rear Restraint</strong>: Manacles might be employed to keep a creature's hands behind its back. In such cases, the creature cannot use its hands to effectively employ any weapon or shield. The creature can attempt to use its hands to perform a skill, but at a -10 penalty (-25 on Disable Device checks to pick the lock of manacles the creature is wearing). While manacled, a creature can attempt to flip its arms beneath its legs, bringing its hands in front of itself. This requires a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check (a separate Escape Artist check is then required to escape the manacles).<br/><br/> <strong>Restraining Two Individuals</strong>: Two creatures might share one set of manacles. While manacled together, the manacled individuals must remain adjacent to one another. If they are not working together, they are both treated as grappled. If they are working together, they can move together in the same round (using the movement speed of the slower creature). A manacled creature can forfeit its turn during combat to mimic the other manacled creature's movements, allowing that creature to act as if unrestrained.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":4},"price":1000,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"manaclesMithral","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428367356,"modifiedTime":1677435523635,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

A shield boss can be added to a buckler, light steel or wooden shield, or heavy steel or wooden shield. Tower shields are too large for a typical shield boss, though one can be crafted to fit a tower shield for an additional 300 gp. Attaching or removing a shield boss requires 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 15 Craft (armor) check; on a failure, the shield boss is not successfully attached or removed and the shield takes 1d6 points of damage that bypasses any hardness.<br/><br/> A reinforcing boss provides extra protection to a shield, increasing the shield's current and maximum hit points by 10. The boss makes the shield 10 pounds heavier and more unwieldy-if the shield imposes a penalty on attack rolls, as do bucklers and tower shields, the penalty increases by 1. Common improvements to the basic reinforcing boss include the following.<br/><br/> <strong>Breakaway Boss</strong>: The metal stud at the center of the reinforcing boss holds a compartment large enough to insert a single splash weapon, such as a vial of acid or alchemist's fire, as a full-round action. On a successful shield bash attack, the weapon vial breaks and deals damage to the target as though it were directly hit by the splash weapon. The shield takes the normal amount of splash damage for being adjacent to the target, but no other creatures adjacent to the target take splash damage from this effect. A new splash weapon must be inserted into the breakaway boss for it to be used again.<br/><br/> <strong>Hooked Boss</strong>: The struts on this reinforcing boss bear large, sturdy hooks, which can be used to snag an opponent's clothing or armor, causing it to stumble. You can attempt trip combat maneuver checks with this shield. If the combat maneuver check is successful, the opponent does not fall prone, but is considered flat-footed until the beginning of its next turn.<br/><br/> <strong>Illuminating Boss</strong>: The stud at the center of this reinforcing boss contains a covered slot large enough to insert a sunrod. Installing a lit sunrod into an illuminating boss is a full-round action.

When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.<br/><br/> A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell.

When unsealed (this requires a move action) and pressed between two surfaces (this also requires a move action), a remora pad creates a firm and waterproof bond between two creatures or objects for up to 24 hours. If two creatures connect themselves in this way, both gain the grappled condition. However, if they are different size categories, only the smaller creature gains this condition.<br/><br/> This bond survives light buffeting and movement, such as that created by incoming tides or by one attached surface dragging the other along underwater. Sharp tugs can break the seal fairly easily, and a willingly attached creature can pull free of the pad with a successful DC 5 Strength check as a standard action (DC 10 as a swift action). This weakness makes remora pads fairly ineffective when attempting to grapple a target, though a grappling creature that sticks itself to a target with a remora pad receives a +6 circumstance bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks to sustain the grapple in subsequent rounds (instead of the normal +5 bonus).<br/><br/> A remora pad's bond is strong enough to support 200 pounds of material, so bonding two heavier objects together requires multiple pads. Underwater travelers often use remora pads to attach themselves to trained aquatic animals for long journeys.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0.5},"price":5,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"remoraPad","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428367615,"modifiedTime":1677435523919,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

These pheromones combine the natural scent of an animal (such as a wolf), humanoid (such as a human), magical beast (such as a unicorn), or vermin (such as a centipede) with alchemical reagents that enhance and refine that scent, making the concoction potent enough to modify the behavior of a creature. A dose of alchemical pheromones must be created for the animal, magical beast, or vermin type or for a single subtype of humanoid; it typically affects only creatures of that type or subtype. The effects of the alchemical pheromone depend on the type.<br/><br/> When it is smeared onto a surface or it is thrown as a splash weapon, the alchemical pheromone fills a 5-foot-radius area with its scent. The scent then remains active for 1 minute. A creature of the targeted type or subtype that enters that area must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be subject to the effects of the pheromone for 1 round. If the creature remains in the affected area, it must attempt a new saving throw each round as long as the pheromone remains active. All alchemical pheromones are mind-affecting effects, but swarms (as well as any other collection of creatures that acts as a single creature) are not immune to them. Creatures that don't need to breathe are immune to alchemical pheromones, while creatures with the scent ability take a -4 penalty on saving throws against them.<br/><br/> <strong>Aggression</strong>: Affected creatures are driven into a mindless frenzy, as if affected by simultaneous <em>confusion</em> and <em>rage</em> spells.<br/><br/> <strong>Arousal</strong>: Affected creatures are aroused and distracted, causing them to lose their Dexterity bonus to AC.<br/><br/> <strong>Simple</strong>: An affected creature is staggered for 1 round.

The wearer becomes difficult to identify, as the mask obscures all facial features.

Additionally, the creature can only apply half its Dexterity modifier to Dexterity checks, Dexterity- based skill checks, initiative checks, and Reflex saving throws. The creature adds only half of its Dexterity modifier to its Armor Class and CMD, and to attack rolls, if applicable. The creature treats all other creatures as if they had concealment against it.<br/><br/> A creature wearing an iron mask can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 35, or DC 40 for a masterwork iron mask). Breaking the mask requires a Strength check (DC 30, or DC 32 for a masterwork iron mask). An iron mask has hardness 10 and 30 hit points. Half the damage dealt to an iron mask applies to the creature wearing it.<br/><br/> Iron masks are typically designed for Medium creatures, but Small ones can be bought for the same price, or larger ones can be bought for higher prices (the price is calculated the same way as buying larger-sized manacles; see page 68 of <em>Ultimate Equipment</em>).

A blanch bomb is effective only against a target that is vulnerable to the type of blanch bomb employed against it. A blanch bomb is thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet.

If the subject ends its turn outside the affected area, the creature's damage reduction returns to its original amount at a rate of 1 point per round.<br/><br/> <b>Mythic</b>: You can expend one use of mythic power while throwing a blanch bomb to infuse the item with mythic power. When the blanch bomb activates, creatures in the area with the matching DR vulnerability must succeed at DC 16 Reflex saves or their DR is immediately reduced by an amount equal to 1/2 your mythic tier.

Camouflage netting must be manufactured to provide camouflage in a single type of terrain, such as snow, sand, forest, grass, swamp, urban, or water. When you hide under the netting in the appropriate terrain, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks as long as you remain immobile and prone. Covering up with camouflage netting is a full-round action requiring a DC 10 Survival check (failure means you do not cover yourself correctly with the netting and do not gain its bonus on Stealth checks). You have the entangled condition when using the netting, except your Dexterity penalty does not affect your initiative or Stealth checks. Taking off camouflage netting is a move action, or a swift action if combined with a move action to stand up from a prone position.<br/><br/> You may spend 1 minute covering an object with camouflage netting. Make a Survival check with a -10 penalty and use the total as the Stealth check result for the object. Creatures who fail a Perception check against this Stealth DC do not recognize what the object is and usually treat it as a natural part of the terrain. For example, you can conceal a wagon as a rock or patch of brush. Covering a Large object requires two nets. Covering a Huge or Gargantuan object requires five nets and takes 10 minutes of work, and the Survival check penalty is -20 instead of -10. Camouflaging a Colossal object depends on its shape but generally requires at least 10 camouflage nets and takes 1 hour of work, and the Survival check penalty is -30 instead of -10.<br/><br/> A creature with the scent ability ignores the effect of camouflage netting and makes checks against your actual Stealth roll when in scent range. Any creature within 10 feet of a Large or larger object hidden by camouflage netting automatically recognizes it as an object covered in camouflage.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":5},"price":20,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Camouflage netting","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"camouflageNetting","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428367730,"modifiedTime":1677435524030,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

A single bead could impart a simple message, or multiple beads can be strung together to form more complicated messages.

Recalling the meaning of a single bead requires a successful DC 10 Intelligence check. Conveying more complicated messages increases this check by 2 for each additional bead used.

Engine fluid, coolant, hydraulic fluids, and stranger substances have mixed together, the chemicals further transformed by the strange radiations of the ship&rsquo;s drives. Fluids can be found in pools or springs, or collected as they drip from larger pieces of wreckage. Odd behavior in animal life or an abundance of mutations can indicate a nearby source of alien fluids. While many such fluids are no more magical or marvelous than crude oil&mdash;and often highly poisonous to humanoids&mdash;others have strange and sometimes desirable effects on biological life.</p>\n<p>The elite of Numeria cultivate a taste for these latter fluids, ostensibly for the insights and pleasant fugues induced by some of the chemicals. Indeed, repeated exposure to such fluids leads first to addiction, then to dependency. Yet beyond these prosaic effects, the fluids of Numeria unleash change: alterations in mind and body both terrible and wonderful.</p>\n<p>Numerian fluids are considered drugs. Initially, the fluids expand perception and insight, opening the mind to new sensations. This overstimulation gives way to mental fatigue, leaving the imbiber distracted and vulnerable to suggestion. A pleasant euphoria lasts as long as the drug&rsquo;s effects. Unlike most drugs, the effects of Numerian fluids can be negated with a successful DC 20 Fortitude saving throw. Success at this saving throw precludes the need to save against addiction, but also prevents the dose from countering the effects of addiction. A person partaking of Numerian fluids can open his mind and body to the fluid&rsquo;s effects, voluntarily forgoing a Fortitude save. Of course, this also entails accepting the risk of addiction and any side effects from the specific type of fluids consumed.</p>\n<p>Each distinct dose of Numerian fluids requires a new roll for side effects, even if multiple doses were recovered from the same source. The inherent instability of the fluid contributes to this variability, as the fluids undergo further reactions even after collection. At the Game Master&rsquo;s option, fluids collected from the same source at the same time can have a higher chance of providing the same side effect. One option for handling such variation is to roll two d20s of different colors for each subsequent drink from a sample, adding one and subtracting the other from the previous result. Another option is rolling twice, and using the second result only if it matches the previous side effect. Either variant increases the potential value of a dose of Numerian fluids, and the potential for unintended consequences in the campaign.</p>\n<p>At least 1 pint of Numerian fluids must be consumed to experience euphoria and expose the drinker to side effects. Smaller amounts leave the drinker slightly disoriented (no game effect). If a drinker consumes a full dose within a single 24-hour period, the drug takes effect when the final portion is consumed.</p>\n<p>In addition to imparting normal addiction to the fluids, certain results also addict the imbiber to a particular side effect. This extra addiction and its strength are listed on the Numerian Fluids Side Effects table. Only rolling the same type of side effect for a dose of fluids alleviates this addiction. This is handled as a distinct case of addiction, rather than being grouped in with other addictions, as is normally the case. This special type of addiction has a frequency and a dose requirement of once per week, rather than once per day. If a given creature has to save against the effects of both general addiction and this special addiction on the same day, only roll for the more serious addiction that day.</p>\n<p>Identifying the effects of a dose of Numerian fluids presents a challenge, as the composition of the fluids changes constantly. A successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check has a 75% chance of correctly identifying a fluid&rsquo;s effects on a specific drinker, and a 25% chance of misidentifying a random effect instead. The dose must be consumed within 1 hour for the results to remain accurate.</p>\n<h2 style=\"margin: 1em 0em 0em; font-size: 1.3em; text-indent: 0em; text-align: left; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: small-caps;\">Numerian Fluids Side Effects</h2>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border: 1px solid white; border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.2974%; height: 986px;\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center; width: 6.6315%; height: 17px;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">d%</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center; width: 90.6563%; height: 17px;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Result</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; width: 6.6315%; height: 68px; background-color: #ced4d9; text-align: center;\">01</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; width: 90.6563%; height: 68px; background-color: #ced4d9; text-align: center;\">The drinker&rsquo;s cellular structure breaks down, and her flesh dissolves off of her bones.

Even the sweet elixir that she sold as the &ldquo;water of life&rdquo; was merely a diluted substance derived from the body of a young child preserved in a jar of honey. Merenfren was quickly tried and executed for her crimes, including the desecration of the dead as well as tricking her noble patients into consuming the vile substance. However, it was too late to undo the chemist's discoveries&mdash;she had already left her mark on Osirian society by inspiring an entire subculture based on the trade and consumption of mumia. An extensive black market took hold in Osirion's grisly underworld, and even the Keleshite masters of Osirion continued to partake of the foul drug made from the dead. The mysterious disappearances of mumia addicts were often attributed to their contact with the Osirian criminal element rather than any of the drug's long-lasting side effects, but mumia sellers knew better and took care to not get hooked to the drug themselves.</p>\n<p>Even today, mumia made from the bodies of properly prepared and aged corpses&mdash;as well as cheap, knock-off mumia made from the embalmed bodies of animals or the recently dead&mdash;fetches a fine price in the back alleysof Sothis and other major cities in northern Garund.

A shield boss can be added to a buckler, light steel or wooden shield, or heavy steel or wooden shield. Tower shields are too large for a typical shield boss, though one can be crafted to fit a tower shield for an additional 300 gp. Attaching or removing a shield boss requires 10 minutes of work and a successful DC 15 Craft (armor) check; on a failure, the shield boss is not successfully attached or removed and the shield takes 1d6 points of damage that bypasses any hardness.<br/><br/> A reinforcing boss provides extra protection to a shield, increasing the shield's current and maximum hit points by 10. The boss makes the shield 10 pounds heavier and more unwieldy-if the shield imposes a penalty on attack rolls, as do bucklers and tower shields, the penalty increases by 1. Common improvements to the basic reinforcing boss include the following.<br/><br/> <strong>Breakaway Boss</strong>: The metal stud at the center of the reinforcing boss holds a compartment large enough to insert a single splash weapon, such as a vial of acid or alchemist's fire, as a full-round action. On a successful shield bash attack, the weapon vial breaks and deals damage to the target as though it were directly hit by the splash weapon. The shield takes the normal amount of splash damage for being adjacent to the target, but no other creatures adjacent to the target take splash damage from this effect. A new splash weapon must be inserted into the breakaway boss for it to be used again.<br/><br/> <strong>Hooked Boss</strong>: The struts on this reinforcing boss bear large, sturdy hooks, which can be used to snag an opponent's clothing or armor, causing it to stumble. You can attempt trip combat maneuver checks with this shield. If the combat maneuver check is successful, the opponent does not fall prone, but is considered flat-footed until the beginning of its next turn.<br/><br/> <strong>Illuminating Boss</strong>: The stud at the center of this reinforcing boss contains a covered slot large enough to insert a sunrod. Installing a lit sunrod into an illuminating boss is a full-round action. If you shake the shield firmly as a move action, you can flip a metal flap fitted over the slot to conceal or reveal the sunrod's glow.<br/><br/> <strong>Masterwork Boss</strong>: Any of the bosses listed above, including the basic reinforcing boss, can be masterwork. A masterwork reinforcing boss increases the shield's current and maximum hit points by 15 instead of 10 and doesn't increase the attack roll penalty.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":11},"price":80,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"shieldBossHooked","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428367778,"modifiedTime":1677435524077,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

This is also the case for creatures that ingest necrobane formaldehyde and subsequently die before the effect's duration has expired.<br/><br/> If an undead creature ingests necrobane formaldehyde (perhaps by eating part of an embalmed corpse), the undead creature becomes fatigued for 2d6 rounds.<br/><br/> When ingested by a living creature, necrobane formaldehyde nauseates the imbiber for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save reduces the nauseated effect to sickened and halves the Constitution damage (minimum 1). This is a poison effect, though the pungent aroma and unmistakably toxic taste of necrobane formaldehyde makes it difficult to use as a surreptitious weapon.<br/><br/> Crafting necrobane formaldehyde requires a successful DC 23 Craft (alchemy) check.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 23</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":3},"price":60,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"necrobaneFormaldehyde","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428367786,"modifiedTime":1677435527026,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

A direct hit from a fiery boulder deals 2d6 points of fire damage and 5 points of fire damage to every creature affected by its splash damage. All creatures affected by a fiery boulder's direct damage take an additional 2d6 points of fire damage the following round; affected creatures can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional damage.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Greater Splash Weapon</h2><p>This splash weapon works in some ways like a normal splash weapon (<i>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</i> 202), but its effects cover a larger area. Like a normal splash weapon, a greater splash weapon requires no weapon proficiency, and you throw it by making a ranged touch attack. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target and to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of that target. It then deals splash damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the target. If the target takes up more than a 5-foot square, you can chose one of its squares as the center of the effect. The direct damage affects the squares normally, so a Large or larger creature could take both the direct damage and the splash damage depending on the square you choose. The splash damage for a greater splash weapon is 5 points of the appropriate damage type for the weapon.<br/><br/> Like a normal splash weapon, you can also choose to target a specific grid intersection (treating it as a ranged attack against AC 5). If it hits, the greater splash weapon deals direct damage to creatures and objects in squares within 5 feet of the targeted intersection, and splash damage to creatures within 10 feet of the targeted intersection. As with a normal splash weapon, you cannot target a grid intersection occupied by a creature.<br/><br/> Greater splash weapons can be thrown as if they were a rock using the rock throwing universal monster rule (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 303), and caught with rock catching (<i>Bestiary</i> 303), though the DC to catch a greater splash weapon is 10 higher than normal due to its fragile and volatile nature. If a creature fails its Reflex saving throw to catch a greater splash weapon, the weapon automatically breaks, treating the creature attempting to catch it as the splash weapon's target.<br/><br/> A greater splash weapon can be used only by Large or larger creatures, though it can be used as ammunition in a catapult or trebuchet. When used as ammunition in one of these siege engines, use the range for the engine rather than the greater splash weapon's range.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><b>Craft (Alchemy)</b> DC 30</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":10},"price":100,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[{"_id":"dfdxdk4zbprjntcc","name":"Use","img":"icons/commodities/stone/ore-chunk-red.webp","description":"","tag":"fieryBoulder","activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":"40","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"autoDeductChargesCost":"","self":{"value":0,"maxFormula":"","per":null},"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"rsak","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[["2d6",{"values":["fire"],"custom":""}],["",{"values":[],"custom":""}]],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":""},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"naturalAttack":{"primaryAttack":true,"secondary":{"attackBonus":"-5","damageMult":0.5}},"nonlethal":false,"usesAmmo":false,"spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","conditionals":[],"enh":{"value":null}}],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"fieryBoulder","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Weapons"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"range":{"value":"40","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"measureTemplate":{"size":"0"},"actionType":"rsak","damage":{"parts":[["2d6","fire"],["",""]]},"ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"0","type":""},"attack":{}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428367790,"modifiedTime":1677435527026,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Hooks are included for attaching items such as canteens, pouches, or even a rolled-up blanket. It has padded bands that strap across the chest and the waist to distribute its weight more evenly. Like a common backpack, it can hold about 2 cubic feet of material in its main container. When wearing a masterwork backpack, treat your Strength score as +1 higher than normal when calculating your carrying capacity.<br/><br/><i>Carrier Backpack</i>: Reinforced metal bars allow for this leather backpack to withstand a greater degree of stress than a traditional pack. Along with the standard backpack compartment, this pack has an additional pouch and harness at its top. Used together, the harness and pouch can safely contain a Tiny or smaller creature. While harnessed, the creature can't leave the backpack or see outside of it; it takes a full-round action to remove the harness from a carried creature.<br/><br/><i>Hydration Backpack</i>: This mostly leather backpack has a series of awkward metallic tubes, which run from the pack over your shoulders, and a small bladder at its base. A hydration backpack has a large pocket identical to that of a regular backpack that holds 2 cubic feet of material, while the bladder holds 1 gallon of liquid. The ends of the metal tubes can be positioned to allow you to easily dispense and drink liquid stored in the attached bladder. Consuming water in this way grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Constitution checks to avoid nonlethal damage during a forced march.<br/><br/><i>Weaponrack Backpack</i>: This leather backpack includes a small weapons rack. The rack holds up to four weapons, such as battleaxes, longswords, maces, or short swords. Allies adjacent to you can retrieve a weapon from the rack as a move action without provoking attacks of opportunity, as if they were simply drawing a weapon.

Given a minute, a catfolk can create a scent mixture and apply it to a solid object, such as a tree, a wall, or even a smaller item such as a weapon or potion vial. When the catfolk does this, it leaves one of the following scent impressions: danger, food, shelter, or possession. The possession impression is always keyed to the specific catfolk using the kit, and signifies that she owns the territory or item. Other races can attempt to use this kit to create the danger, food, or shelter impression, but doing so requires a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check. A catfolk can detect a particular scent applied with a trailscent kit from 30 feet away. If the scent is upwind, the range at which a catfolk can detect the scent increases to 60 feet; if it is downwind, the range drops to 15 feet.

You may spit a mouthful of keros oil past an open flame (such as a candle, tindertwig, or torch) to ignite it, creating a brief burst of fire. If you use it to attack, the attack is a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 5 feet that deals 1d3 points of fire damage.

Perfect ice is an alchemically engineered form of water that briefly converts any moisture it touches into a similar state. When a flask of perfect ice is opened or broken (such as by being thrown as a splash weapon), the snowflake within expands rapidly, forming a layer of ice and snow with a 60-foot radius along any nearby surface. Any living creature that touches an area of perfect ice or starts its turn in a space of perfect ice takes 4d6 points of damage from desiccation as some of the water in its body crystallizes (Fortitude DC 18 half). Creatures with the water subtype take half again as much damage (150%) and receive no saving throw. The ice crystals that form along flat surfaces are large and strong, and are treated as caltrops.

The application of the powder depends on the disease from which it is refined. Someone using powder made from diseases contracted by ingestion must apply it to food (a full-round action) for the victim to consume. Those using powder made from diseases contracted by injury must apply the powder to weapons (a standard action, as per the poison application rules) and deal damage to victims to subject them to the contagion. Diseases contracted by inhalation require the user to disperse the powder by throwing it into the air. Throwing a handful of plague powder is a splash attack with a range increment of 5 feet. Anyone standing in the square of impact must succeed at a save with a DC equal to that of the disease from which the powder is made to avoid contracting the illness, while those in adjacent squares must attempt the same save with a +4 bonus. Diseases spread through contact can use any of the three manners of application.<br/><br/> The most common disease refined for these powders is filth fever, costing 144 gp, but refined plague powders of other diseases are available, with a price equal to the base save DC of the disease squared. Making a plague powder always requires access to a sample of the disease and exposes the creator to the disease in question each day of crafting. Crafting a dose of plague powder requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.</p><h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><p><b>Craft (Alchemy)</b> DC 25</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[{"_id":"rb3c0xg8djl6h8y7","name":"Use","img":"icons/commodities/materials/bowl-powder-teal.webp","description":"","tag":"plaguePowder","activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":"0","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"autoDeductChargesCost":"","self":{"value":0,"maxFormula":"","per":null},"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"rsak","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[["",{"values":[],"custom":""}],["",{"values":[],"custom":""}]],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":""},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"naturalAttack":{"primaryAttack":true,"secondary":{"attackBonus":"-5","damageMult":0.5}},"nonlethal":false,"usesAmmo":false,"spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","conditionals":[],"enh":{"value":null}}],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"plaguePowder","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Weapons"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"range":{"value":"0","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"measureTemplate":{"size":"0"},"actionType":"rsak","damage":{"parts":[["",""],["",""]]},"ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"0","type":""},"attack":{}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428368059,"modifiedTime":1677435527028,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

It has no effect on natives of that plane, but grants unusual properties when consumed by creatures from the Material Plane.<br/><br/> Any creature with the water affinity racial trait, including undines, that drinks elemental brine finds her innate magic bolstered. If the creature is a sorcerer with the elemental (water) bloodline, she casts her bloodline powers and spells at +1 caster level. If the creature is a cleric with the Water domain, she treats her Wisdom modifier as 2 points higher for Water domain powers and spells. This does not grant early access to level-based powers; it only affects powers that she could already use without this trait. This benefit lasts 24 hours.<br/><br/> Creatures with the aquatic subtype that imbibe elemental brine become immune to poison, although poisons active when the brine is imbibed still run their course. If the creature dwells in saltwater, it also becomes undetectable by scent for the same duration. Both of these effects last 24 hours.<br/><br/> Finally, elemental brine can be used as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. While it has little effect on most creatures (other than soaking them in salty water) when used in this way, a bottle of elemental brine is quite lethal if it's flung at a creature with the fire subtype. On a direct hit, a creature with the fire subtype takes 2d6 points of damage, and creatures with the fire subtype in adjacent squares take 1d4 points of damage. In addition, a direct hit against a creature with the fire subtype creates a unique interplay between elemental brine's salt and water and the creature's flames, making the target more conductive and thus more susceptible to electrocution. Anytime the target would take electricity damage within the next minute, it must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or take 1-1/2 times as much electricity damage as normal.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":500,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[{"_id":"357b82zl3ut1b7wh","name":"Use","img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/unique-2.jpg","description":"","tag":"elementalBrine","activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":"10","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"autoDeductChargesCost":"","self":{"value":0,"maxFormula":"","per":null},"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"0","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"rsak","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[["2d6",{"values":[],"custom":"salt water"}],["",{"values":[],"custom":""}]],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":""},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"20","type":"ref","description":""},"effectNotes":["see text"],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"naturalAttack":{"primaryAttack":true,"secondary":{"attackBonus":"-5","damageMult":0.5}},"nonlethal":false,"usesAmmo":false,"spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","conditionals":[],"enh":{"value":null}}],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"elementalBrine","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Weapons"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"range":{"value":"10","units":"ft","maxIncrements":"1","minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"measureTemplate":{"size":"0"},"actionType":"rsak","damage":{"parts":[["2d6","salt water"],["",""]]},"ability":{"attack":"","damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":1},"save":{"dc":"20","type":"ref"},"attack":{}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428368115,"modifiedTime":1677435527030,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

By standing on the footrests and holding the tops of the poles you can avoid certain ground-based threats to your feet. For example, you can use stilts to cross water without getting wet, but you would still activate a trap that triggers when you walk in a certain area. Using stilts reduces your base speed from 30 feet to 20 feet, or from 20 feet to 15 feet. You can hop off your stilts as a move action, or as a free action with a successful DC 10 Acrobatics check.<br/><br/> You must use both your hands to walk with stilts. Walking with stilts requires a DC 5 Acrobatics check for each move. Failing this check means you do not move for that move action; failing by 5 or more means you fall off the stilts. If you want to use one hand for something else while standing on stilts, you must succeed at a DC 10 Acrobatics check or lose the action; if you want to use two hands, the DC increases to 20.<br/><br/> Stilts for a Medium creature raise you 2 feet above the ground; stilts for a Small creature raise you 1 foot from the ground. You can use taller stilts, but each additional foot of elevation increases the Acrobatics DCs of using stilts by +5. A stilt has hardness 5 and 10 hit points. If you only have one stilt, your speed drops to 5 feet because you can only hop rather than walk.<br/><br/><em>Masterwork Stilts</em>: These stilts strap to your feet and legs, allowing you to use your hands for other tasks without penalty. Walking on masterwork stilts requires a DC 10 Acrobatics check.

Inflating the balloon is a move action. Once filled, the balloon floats upward at a speed of 60 feet per round. The balloon can lift up to 20 pounds of weight as it rises, though carrying more than 10 pounds reduces its speed to 30 feet per round. Multiple balloons attached to a single object add their carrying capacities together when determining how much weight they can lift.

A manacled creature can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles). Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points.<br/><br/>Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the price of the manacles.<br/><br/>For the same price, you can buy manacles for a Small creature. For a Large creature, manacles cost 10 times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, 100 times the indicated amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made manacles, which cost at least 100 times the indicated amount.<br/><br/>Mithral Manacles: These bindings are more difficult to break than standard manacles and are particularly useful against lycanthropes. They have hardness 15, 30 hit points, and a break DC of 30. They are otherwise treated as masterwork manacles.</p><h2 class=\"title\">Expanded Information</h2><p><strong>Source</strong>: <em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Path of the Hellknight pg.15</em><br/><br/>Manacles are detailed on page 68 of <em>Ultimate Equipment</em>. The specifics of their effects are largely left to the GM's discretion, due in large part to manacles' versatility. However, for their most common uses, GMs might employ the following effects.<br/><br/> <strong>Fetters</strong>: These manacles are specifically designed to fit around the ankles, and use the same rules for breaking, escape, and cost relative to size. A creature in fetters is entangled and can move at only half speed. In addition, a fettered creature must succeed at a DC 15 Acrobatics check to move more than its (reduced) speed in a round. If it fails the check by 5 or more, the creature falls prone.<br/><br/> <strong>Frontal Restraint</strong>: A creature whose wrists are bound with manacles can wield only one melee weapon or shield in combat (the weapon may be a two-handed weapon). It cannot make use of ranged weapons, except for crossbows (but even these cannot be reloaded by the bound creature). Any attack the creature makes while manacled takes a -4 penalty. The creature can attempt skill checks using its hands, but at a -5 penalty (-15 on Disable Device checks to pick the lock of manacles the creature is wearing).<br/><br/> <strong>Rear Restraint</strong>: Manacles might be employed to keep a creature's hands behind its back. In such cases, the creature cannot use its hands to effectively employ any weapon or shield. The creature can attempt to use its hands to perform a skill, but at a -10 penalty (-25 on Disable Device checks to pick the lock of manacles the creature is wearing). While manacled, a creature can attempt to flip its arms beneath its legs, bringing its hands in front of itself. This requires a successful DC 25 Escape Artist check (a separate Escape Artist check is then required to escape the manacles).<br/><br/> <strong>Restraining Two Individuals</strong>: Two creatures might share one set of manacles. While manacled together, the manacled individuals must remain adjacent to one another. If they are not working together, they are both treated as grappled. If they are working together, they can move together in the same round (using the movement speed of the slower creature). A manacled creature can forfeit its turn during combat to mimic the other manacled creature's movements, allowing that creature to act as if unrestrained.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2},"price":15,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"manacles","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428368166,"modifiedTime":1677435524436,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Additionally, half-elves are keenly aware of the effort put into the leaves' growth and normally only sell the products of their labors to others of their kind. When the golden maple's delicate, five-pointed leaves finally take on their namesake's color, they can be cut, dried, and then ground into a fine powder, a process that requires a DC 15 Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) check. When used in conjunction with the Craft (alchemy) skill to create special substances and items like alchemical grease or tanglefoot bags, golden maple leaves reduce the Craft DC by 5 and add +1 to the DC of any save required by the alchemical item. A single dose of golden maple leaf powder is sufficient to augment the crafting of three alchemical items.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0.5},"price":50,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"goldenMapleLeaves","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428368185,"modifiedTime":1677435527032,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

A sureseal bladder is made of a thin membrane that won't allow liquid through. By passing a solid spout or tube through the membrane, you can fill the bladder without allowing in any ambient seawater, and the membrane seals behind the spout. Once the bladder is full, the drinker can nip on the end of the membrane in order to sip the drink at her leisure, slowly crumpling the bladder for eventual disposal. The cheaper mundane sureseal bladders hold about 2 cups of liquid and work best for enjoying a favorite drink; the listed weight assumes the mundane sureseal bladder is full. Potions rely on drinking the entire dose, so potion sureseal bladders, while much smaller (just large enough for a potion), are pressurized in order to expel the entire potion at once without losing any of it, allowing the drinker to drink them as a standard action just like drinking a potion above the waves. Either type of sureseal bladder can be used only once.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":0.1,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"suresealBladder","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Adventuring Gear"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428368240,"modifiedTime":1677435524506,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
