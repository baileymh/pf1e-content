As soon as one of the deck's cards is drawn at random, though, its nature becomes apparent and an effect determined by the chosen card is bestowed upon the user-often to life-altering effect.  A bearer of a Harrow Deck of Many Things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards he will draw before doing so. These cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw any more cards from the deck than he announced (unless the effect of a drawn card states otherwise). If the character does not willingly draw his allotted number or is somehow prevented from doing so, the cards flip out of the deck on their own after 1 hour. Future attempts to draw cards from the deck made by someone who has already drawn his allotted number reveal only blank cards.  Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced, making it possible to draw the same card twice.

On command, the mortar and pestle shrink down small enough to fit in a belt pouch and weigh only 3 pounds. The mortar must be empty to shrink.  The mortar and pestle can be commanded to grind any object placed inside; each round, the object takes 3d6 points of damage that bypasses hardness. Any object reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is ground into powder. Magic items can attempt a DC 19 Fortitude save each round to avoid taking damage. Artifacts can't be destroyed in the mortar and pestle.  The mortar is large enough to hold a single Medium creature, but it can enlarge to hold up to four Medium creatures or one Large creature. The mortar can be commanded to fly at a speed of 30 feet as overland flight, for up to 8 hours per day. Using the pestle to steer the mortar grants a +10 bonus on Fly checks. Twice per day, the mortar can create a single-use phase door that closes behind the mortar.

When carried by a non-mythic creature, a nexus crystal bestows the ability to survive the conditions of a hostile plane as though the bearer were native to that plane. For example, the crystal would give immunity to the fires of the Plane of Fire and the life-draining radiation of the Negative Energy Plane. Any adaptation given protects only against the hazards of the plane itself, not the creatures within it-fire attacks from creatures on the Plane of Fire are still hazardous to the bearer. The crystal doesn't provide protection against extreme conditions not normally experienced by inhabitants of the given plane, such as the vacuum of space on the Material Plane.   When carried by a mythic creature, a nexus crystal has the following additional powers.   • As a standard action, the bearer can bestow the crystal's planar adaptation ability to another by touching the creature with the crystal and expending one use of mythic power. The protection can be withdrawn over any distance on the same plane with a standard action. The use of mythic power can't be recovered while the protection remains in place. If another creature claims the crystal and uses this ability, any protection bestowed by the previous owner immediately ends.   • As a standard action, the bearer can use plane shift to move herself and up to seven other willing creatures to any plane she is familiar with by expending one use of mythic power. If traveling to a location she's already visited, she can reduce the inaccuracy of plane shift by expending two uses of mythic power when she does so, in which case she appears 1d6-1 miles (minimum 0 miles) from her destination.   • As a standard action, the bearer can touch another creature with the nexus crystal and expend three uses of mythic power to use plane shift to move the target to a random plane (Reflex DC 27 negates).   • As a standard action, the bearer can expend two uses of mythic power to create a widened dimensional lock centered on the crystal instead of on a point in space. The lock lasts for 24 hours or until dismissed.   • As a full-round action, the bearer can attempt to draw back other creatures that teleported away by expending four uses of mythic power. If she succeeds at a DC 40 Knowledge (planes) check, the bearer can draw back up to one creature per mythic tier she possesses that departed via a conjuration (teleportation) effect in the previous round. To draw back a creature, the bearer must be within 15 feet of the location the creature left from. If the creature resists, it can attempt a Will save (DC 25 + the bearer's tier) to avoid returning. The bearer can choose freely which creatures from a group to pull back, and can even pull back creatures that departed with different means or to different destinations, as long as their points of departure are within range.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Mythic Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Nexus Crystal","cl":18,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"nexusCrystalArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264585,"modifiedTime":1677435299221,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Ring 1: Daughters of the Fangwood green.  Ring 2: Hear my ardent call.  Ring 3: Discharge now to oaths long sworn.  Ring 4: For Accressiel glory, live or fall.  Dryad's Song grants anyone holding it a +5 morale bonus on all Diplomacy and Intimidate skill checks against fey that live within Fangwood Forest. Dryad's Song allows its wielder to cast diminish plants, entangle, plant growth, and wood shape at will, though these spells affect plants only within Fangwood Forest. Up to three times each day, by reciting the poem on its rings as a full-round action, Dryad's Song allows its wielder to either summon 40 HD worth of  dryads, nymphs, and satyrs, or allows its wielder and up to 19 additional Medium or smaller creatures to teleport anywhere within the Fangwood Forest as if they were very familiar with the destination. Summoned fey remain for 20 hours, can be dismissed at will, and are not obligated to obey the wielder's command; dryads summoned by Dryad's Song lose their tree dependence weakness while they serve on the wielder's behalf. Unlike the corrupted version of the artifact, the fully restored Dryad's Song grants access to its magic whether its various rings are slotted into the scepter or not. Just like the corrupted version, Dryad's Song can purge the Darkblight from a living creature within 60 feet as a full-round action.  A ring from the scepter may be gifted to another person. The ring can be worn as a bracelet or on a necklace (occupying the appropriate magic item slot), and grants a +3 resistance bonus on its wearer's saving throws. Once per day, the ring can be used to contact the wielder of Dryad's Song via sending.

Its powers are quite different, however, and are dependent on the Charisma of the holder. Any character touching a talisman of reluctant wishes must make a DC 15 Charisma check.   If the check fails, the talisman acts as a stone of weight (see page 351). Discarding it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman.   If the check succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a wish i s m ade w ith i t, whichever comes first. It then disappears.

The artifact grants one wish for every 6 points of the character's Charisma (round down). It grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap.

Tiny mechanisms whir and grind, powering a constant thump reminiscent of a heartbeat. When placed upon the chest of a humanoid creature, the Heart of Nhur Athemon phases into the chest cavity, consuming and replacing the user's natural heart, and granting the user a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution. Anyone who touches the Heart of Nhur Athemon must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be compelled to place the heart against her chest (this is a mind-affecting compulsion effect).  A successful DC 30 caster level check made as part of a remove curse spell or similar effect forces the Heart of Nhur Athemon to phase out of its host's chest. Because the Heart of Nhur Athemon consumes its host's natural heart, destroying or expelling the item while it is keeping a character alive kills the character 1 round after it's removed, unless a restoration spell is immediately applied to the host.  The heart is also the phylactery of the Azlanti lich Nhur Athemon. If Nhur Athemon is destroyed, the phylactery immediately begins to rebuild the lich's body nearby.

The item seems to grant its bearer a +5 bonus on Stealth checks in wooded areas.  If an individual takes possession of the sasquatch skull for more than 24 hours, it quickly begins to stink. The smell is undetectable by the skull's bearer, but companions and creatures within 30 feet find the pungent smell extremely noticeable. The smell imposes a -2 penalty on Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks made by the skull's owner. In addition, aggressive wild animals always target the skull's owner first during combat. The skull need not be on the owner's person for the curse to manifest, so long as ownership has not been transferred through sale, gift, or theft.  A remove curse spell suppresses the stench for 1d4 days. Transferring ownership of the skull transfers the curse to its new owner, but the curse remains on the last owner if the skull is abandoned. The only way to remove the curse permanently other than giving away the skull is to use a miracle or wish spell, or to bury the skull in a forested area and keep watch for 24 hours. The skull's owner must be part of this graveside vigil, and must howl and knock on a nearby log or rock at sunset and sundown.

Upon command, it expands to a length of 6 feet and can be wielded as a double weapon that has a +4 enhancement bonus. The head deals 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage and can be used to make trip attacks, while the forked end deals 1d6 points of piercing damage. The wielder can use either end as the primary weapon, with the other becoming the off-hand weapon.  Though it is formidable in melee, the scepter's true value lies in its ability to allow its wielder to claim dominion over specific areas, people, reality, and even time. As a move action, the wielder can plant the scepter's forked end into the ground to activate a 120-foot aura of dominion. The aura remains active so long as the scepter remains there. The wielder can then concentrate to manipulate the aura to produce various magical effects. The wielder can produce only a single effect at a time, and each new effect requires a new action. The effects are as follows.  • At will, the wielder can use a standard action to manipulate the aura to emulate the effects of either sanctuary or protection against chaos. These effects include all willing creatures within the aura of dominion. If the wielder activates the sanctuary effect (DC 15), all allies within the aura are subject to the usual terms of the spell. If any allies break the spell's terms, the effect immediately ends for everyone affected.  • Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can manipulate the aura to block any extradimensional travel within the aura of dominion. The area within the aura is treated as if under the effects of dimensional lock.  • Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can manipulate the aura to force extraplanar creatures entering the aura of dominion to return to their home planes immediately, as if targeted by a banishment spell. Up to 40 Hit Dice of creatures can be affected by this effect, and creatures subject to this effect can resist with a successful DC 21 Will save.  • Lastly, once per day as a standard action, the wielder can alter time within the aura of dominion. The wielder can use time stop and include a number of people in the effect equal to 1 + the user's Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Unwilling creatures can resist this effect with a successful DC 23 Will save. Those affected by the time stop can interact with each other as normal, and individuals are not restricted from leaving the aura of dominion while the effect is in place.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +4 light mace</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 83","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":30},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Was Scepter","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"abjuration and transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"wasScepterArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264607,"modifiedTime":1677435299222,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Its side is marked with the Sihedron Rune, while many other Thassilonian runes grace its rim.  A runeslave cauldron has the ability to infuse the body of a freshly slain giant, reviving it and transforming it into a runeslave (see page 412). Before it can be used, the runeslave cauldron must first be activated by filling it with a specially prepared broth of rare necromantic ingredients and rainwater collected from several open graves. The cost of the special ingredients is 10,000 gp, but once the cauldron is filled, a fire lights under it automatically and keeps the broth bubbling and functional for 1 year.  Once the cauldron is filled with broth, one need only sacrifice a giant (the method of killing the giant is incidental) and then place the giant's corpse wholly or partially within the cauldron's bubbling contents. One hour later, the sacrificed giant rises from the cauldron as if true resurrection had been cast on it. In addition, the newly revived giant gains the runeslave template (see page 412). The cauldron can revive up to five giants a day in this manner. Non-giant corpses placed in the broth are unaffected by the cauldron's magic.  Any living creature (save for a runeslave) completely immersed in the boiling broth inside a functional runeslave cauldron immediately takes 6d6 points of fire damage per round. In addition, the smoke produced by the cauldron as it boils is particularly noxious to good-aligned beings. It spreads to a radius of 30 feet around the cauldron, and while the smoke isn't thick enough to obscure vision, its foul-smelling vapors sting and burn those of good alignment. Each round such a creature remains in the smoke, he must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be blinded and nauseated for as long as he remains in the area plus an additional 1d6 rounds after leaving the area.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>RotRL-AE-Appendix","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":900},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Runeslave Cauldron","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"necromancy"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"runeslaveCauldronArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264609,"modifiedTime":1677435299222,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Though non-mythic creatures can board the ship as passengers, the Silver Maiden requires a mythic creature to be its captain. If the ship currently has no captain, a mythic character can claim the captaincy by touching the ship's wheel and stating her desire to be captain. The captain then serves until death or voluntarily retirement. Upon assuming the captaincy, the captain becomes aware of all of the ship's powers, and can propel the ship completely unaided from anywhere aboard the vessel, whether sailing the high seas of a terrestrial world or gliding through the vast blackness of deep space.   At will, the captain can expend two uses of mythic power to launch the Silver Maiden into outer space. Once in space, the ship can sail through the vacuum at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a voyage between two planets within a solar system takes 2d20 days, and a voyage to another star system takes 2d20 weeks (or more at the GM's discretion). The captain must know which world she wishes to travel to (as if the captain cast greater teleport). When the ship arrives at its destination, it slowly descends to the surface (as the feather fall spell), and typically lands in a body of water. Once earthbound, the ship moves as a standard sailing ship. If the planet has no water or comparable liquid, the ship lands on solid ground and is unable to move until the captain once again launches the ship back into space.   The Silver Maiden can also sail the Outer Planes. At will, the captain can expend three uses of mythic power to transport the ship to another plane, as the plane shift spell. When the ship arrives at its extraplanar destination, it appears in a body of water or comparable liquid, 1 to 100 miles from the captain's intended destination. If the plane has no water (such as the Plane of Earth) the ship appears on solid ground, and is unable to move until the captain transports it to another plane. If the plane has neither water nor a solid surface, such as the Plane of Air, the ship continues to slowly fall (as the feather fall spell) until the captain t ransports i t to another plane.   The Silver Maiden protects its passengers from the environmental dangers of deep space and the outer planes, and can even sail the molten surface of a star. At all times, the ship simulates a comfortable temperature and gravity normal for its current captain's home world.

The Queen of the Night gifted these magical crystals to the demagogue as a sign of her favor.  As a standard action, a creature who wears a pendant of the first tears can touch the physical exterior of Inkariax's palace at area B16 and be instantly transported into its antechamber. This functions as plane shift, with White Death's Diadem treated as a demiplane and no chance that the wearer arrives anywhere except for a random open space on the floor of the palace's antechamber (area B18). The wearer can join hands with additional creatures for all to be transported into the antechamber in this way, though a pendant can transport  only up to eight creatures at a time. Similarly, a wearer inside the antechamber can touch its inner walls as a standard action to be transported to the closest location on the far side of the antechamber's walls in area B16.

Unlike the major chapters of the Book of the Damned, the apocrypha are not bound within a single set of covers-some pages are crudely bound into small folios, held together by lengths of chain or jagged barbs, or impaled on metal spikes, while others are simply loose leaves. Many pages are duplicates or filled with irrelevant writing on other topics, as if originally used for drafting, while the relevant content appears as marginalia. Despite their disorganized state, the pages never scatter or become lost; all of the various portions mysteriously remain together.  A good-aligned creature that touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains 1 negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from this section of the book for 24 hours. A nonevil creature attempting to read this section of the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have her alignment permanently move one step toward evil.  These pages of the Book of the Damned are written in a mix of Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal; knowledge of all three is necessary to understand their contents. A reader who spends at least 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the apocrypha gains certain benefits. Where specified, these benefits apply to a single evil outsider subtype (other than daemon, demon, or devil). For every additional 10 days spent studying the apocrypha, the reader can gain these benefits with an additional subtype.  When using this portion of the Book of the Damned as a reference (by consulting it for at least an hour), the user gains a +4 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks regarding one evil outsider subtype. The apocrypha contain copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as sacrifice (see page 185). When the reader casts planar ally or planar binding (including  the lesser and greater versions) to bind a creature of her chosen subtype, the HD limit for the conjured outsider increases by 2.  The Book of the Damned apocrypha serve as the focal point for an unhallow spell. Three times per day, the reader can cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, greater planar binding (but only against evil outsiders of the type chosen when studying the apocrypha), or unholy blight. Whenever the bearer uses one of the apocrypha's daily spells, there is a 1% chance that a creature of her chosen subtype notices; if the spell chosen is associated with a creature of that subtype, the chance doubles, and the creature that notices is one that could use that spell-like ability. Such creatures usually seek to embroil the user in their schemes to further their fiendish agendas.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Book of the Damned","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":12},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Book Of The Damned (apocrypha)","cl":25,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"all schools [evil lawful]"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"bookOfTheDamnedApocryphaArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264618,"modifiedTime":1677435299222,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Originally, the key allowed the carrier to command limitless numbers of clockworks simultaneously. With this key, Xin could command his entire clockwork army effortlessly, and its use was key to his power over Thassilon. But when Xin used it as an element in the clockwork reliquary's construction, the key's powers were vastly diminished. Xin accepted this as a necessity, since if all had gone according to plan, he would still be able to command his army using his new body. The diminished key can be recovered from the destroyed reliquary's remains.  The guardian key can fit into any clockwork construct's keyhole, and fully winds a clockwork with a single turn made as a move action. Clockworks wound by the guardian key are healed of 5d8+20 points of damage, remain active for 10 times longer than they normally would, and during this period gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. The guardian key can also be used to seize control of a clockwork. To do so, a creature must attempt a touch attack against the target clockwork as a standard action. If it hits, the clockwork can attempt a DC 15 Will save to resist. If the clockwork's save fails, that clockwork regards the key's carrier as its creator, and follows that person's commands to the letter-provided the commands are spoken in Thassilonian.

The demon lord Nocticula discovered a method to bypass this, however, and now any demon lord slain by her is instead absorbed into her realm, creating an island in her domain. The demon lord's personality and themes influence the nature of the newly formed isle, but little of its physical form remains save for its ichor. This lifeblood fossilizes deep within the island into Nahyndrian crystals.   The majority of Nahyndrian crystals are flawed, but the most perfect of them retain the mythic power of their demonic source. These Nahyndrian crystals have hardness 30 and 120 hit points, and can be used in the creation of various powerful items.   Nahyndrian crystals feel cold to the touch, and contact with one can be debilitating. When a creature touches a Nahyndrian crystal, it takes 1d4 points of Wisdom drain as flashes of horrific anguish flood the creature's mind (Fortitude DC 25 negates). A creature can only be affected in this way by a Nahyndrian crystal once in a 24-hour period.   A creature that carries a Nahyndrian crystal on its person (even if the crystal is carried in an extradimensional space, such as a bag of holding) gains 2 negative levels; creatures with both the chaotic and evil subtypes only gain 1 negative level in this manner. These negative levels remain as long as the crystal is carried and are removed as soon as the crystal is abandoned. The negative levels from multiple Nahyndrian crystals stack. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way while the crystal is possessed (including via restoration spells). A creature who carries enough Nahyndrian crystals to gain enough negative levels to equal or exceed its Hit Dice immediately dies-a humanoid slain in this manner immediately rises as an advanced bodak.   A Nahyndrian crystal cannot be teleported. Anyone attempting to use a teleportation effect on a creature carrying a Nahyndrian crystal (including the creature itself) must attempt a DC 30 caster level check. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn't work and is wasted; otherwise, the spell works normally, but any Nahyndrian crystals carried by the teleporter remain behind, dropping to the ground where the teleporter was previously standing.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 76","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":3},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Nahyndrian Crystal","cl":30,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration and necromancy [evil]"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"nahyndrianCrystalArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264627,"modifiedTime":1677435299223,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The tentacle is 8 feet in length and too rubbery and flexible to carry comfortably; humanoids find it more convenient to wear the tentacle of the Vaults wrapped around the waist like a belt or over the shoulder as a sash, but no matter how the tentacle is worn, it does not occupy a magic item slot. The tentacle's owner can cast dispel magic and remove disease each five times per day.  The tentacle's primary power activates when its owner tosses it onto the ground and speaks a command word as a standard action. The tentacle animates, transforming into a construct with the statistics listed in the paragraph below until the owner commands the construct to return to an inanimate tentacle as a free action. The construct obeys and serves its owner. It understands all languages spoken by its owner but does not speak. If the construct is destroyed, the artifact reverts to an inanimate tentacle that can be used again at a later time. The tentacle of the Vaults can be animated for up to 1 hour each day. This time does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.  When animated, the tentacle of the Vaults has the statistics of a Medium animated object (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 14) with a hardness of 20, the grab special attack, and the following special abilities.  Aboleth-Bane Aura (Su) A magical aura extends in a 20-foot radius centered on the construct. All creatures within the aura, including the construct, gain a +8 bonus on attack rolls and melee damage rolls against aberrations. Any creature subject to a compulsion effect immediately receives another saving throw to break free from the effect (if one was allowed to begin with) when it enters the aura and at the start of its turn each round that it remains within the aura.  Dispel Illusion (Sp) As a swift action, the construct can cast dispel magic (CL 20th) on an i llusion spell within 100 feet. This ability does not count against the number of uses of dispel magic granted by the artifact.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 120","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":8},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Tentacle Of The Vaults","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"all schools"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"tentacleOfTheVaultsArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264630,"modifiedTime":1677435299223,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Chomper hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred spirits of destruction.   Chomper has all of the magical abilities of a regular bag of devouring, along with the following additional powers.   • As a standard action, Chomper's possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any single creature or unattended item within a 5-foot radius.

This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder's abilities.   • When a non-demon is in possession of Chomper, the bag's cursed aura imparts a -1 penalty on all of its wielder's attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.

Baba Yaga crafted the Artrosa Ring for her chosen warden of the sacred site of Artrosa, and it functions as a ring of protection +2 and a ring of regeneration. Within 15 miles of Artrosa's towering figures, the Artrosa Ring also grants its wearer the following abilities.   Quicksilver: The wearer can teleport to any location inside Artrosa's dungeons or within a 15-mile radius of Artrosa. Any location in this area is considered very familiar.   Seer: By concentrating for 10 minutes, the wearer can see and hear everything that transpires in a single chamber inside Artrosa, as if using clairaudience/clairvoyance.   Shroud: Three times per day, the wearer can alter the appearance of a single room within one of Artrosa's dungeons, as well as the appearance of any creatures inside the room, as with mirage arcana and veil. The wearer must be present in the room to use this ability, and the illusions fade as soon as the wearer leaves the room.   Threefold Aspect: Whenever the wearer enters one of Artrosa's dungeons, her age and appearance shift to match that of the corresponding dungeon (maiden, mother, or crone) as if affected by the threefold aspectAPG spell. If the wearer moves to a different dungeon, her age and appearance change accordingly. The wearer doesn't gain additional skill ranks, and a spellcaster doesn't gain any additional bonus spells for her increased ability scores, but the save DCs for her spells do increase. Outside these dungeons, the wearer returns to her natural age and appearance. The wearer has no control over this ability-it automatically takes effect whenever the wearer enters one of Artrosa's dungeons.   Vision: If the wearer is a witch of at least 10th level, she gains access to the vision major hex and can use it as if she had it as a normal class feature.   Outside of Artrosa, the Artrosa Ring loses all of the above abilities except its function as a ring of protection +2 and a ring of regeneration.

The barding of pleated light grants additional powers related to the rippling light of an aurora. These powers can be activated by the wearer's rider; the wearer can activate the barding's powers only if it has an Intelligence score of 3 or greater.  First, the barding can be activated as the blinding shield special ability at will, but the wearer and the wearer's rider are both immune to this blinding effect. Second, as an immediate action, the armor can be activated to divert harmful light or shadows. This grants the armor's spell resistance to the wearer's rider for 1 round, but this spell resistance only protects against spells with the light or shadow descriptor. Finally, the armor allows the wearer to pass through shimmering curtains of light. As an immediate action when charging, the armor can be activated to select any 10-foot-square area in the path of the charge. A curtain of multicolored light appears momentarily on each side of this area. The wearer can charge across this area as though it did not exist, disappearing into a ripple of light on one side and reappearing in a ripple of light on the other side. The wearer ignores terrain or obstacles in the intervening area (allowing the wearer to charge through allies in the area, for example), and the intervening area does not count toward the wearer's charge movement.

{"_id":"5nA9y54zPX4LwzEZ","name":"Thought Record [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Though this tube resembles a simple copper pipe, its exotic metal reshapes the flow of time itself. A thought record measures 1 foot in length, and despite its light weight, it resists sudden acceleration as if it were a heavy, massive tree trunk. Intricate patterns are etched inside the tube, constantly shifting into new configurations that never repeat. Thought  records store and replay memories, absorbing the entirety of a person's experience in an instant. These memories remain in the thought record indefinitely and can't be altered, though subsequent recordings from the same individual can be added. Thought records absorb such imprints unpredictably, with no indication of when the artifact will trigger or how to activate it deliberately. When the thought record records a life, its etched metal surface fades, appearing instead as a tiny window into a cosmic starscape. No known limit exists as to how many sets of memories a single thought record can hold.  Memories stored in a thought record can be used along with reality-altering magic such as miracle or wish to bring back those irrevocably lost to death. Opinions differ on whether this amounts to an exotic resurrection or if it overwrites a newborn soul with the experiences of another.  A thought record can allow its holder to experience portions of another's life in an instant. It is unclear what act triggers this replay, though most commonly it happens immediately when a creature first touches the device. When the thought record replays the past, the holder experiences the memories stored in the device not just as though she were present, but as if she were consciously making the choices herself.  Occult researchers speculate that thought records create conduits to the Akashic Record, and that experiencing memories stored within such a rod brings the consciousness of the holder into the past of another person, forming a gestalt of their minds. This gestalt experiences and affects the events as they took place, not merely when they were recorded. According to this theory, those experiencing a memory don't merely observe another's life-they take a role in shaping it. Some even suspect that a thought record can share memories that have yet to be stored. Whatever the explanation, the experiences of the thought record are so total that the creature living the memories suffers from any mental conditions suffered in the memories, such as insanity, damage to mental ability scores, and mind-affecting effects.  Although a thought record can record the memories of many individuals, it almost never replays more than one creature's memories for a single user. Instead, later activations by that user replay other memories from the same creature, revealing more of its life. Repeated activation takes the user through another's life in bursts of instantaneous visions. The thought record does not replay recorded memories in sequential order. Instead, it skips back and forth across the life of the recorder, with later activations shedding light on earlier activations, regardless of their chronological order.  The same temporal effects that let a thought record transmit memories across time render it nearly invulnerable to physical harm. Both the rod and the memories stored within resist any attempts at destruction or alteration.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Occult Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Thought Record","cl":15,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"divination"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"thoughtRecordArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264644,"modifiedTime":1677435299224,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

When the anathema archive is opened, it presents a tangle of Thassilonian runes to the observer. Each time the scroll is unfurled, the runes are in a different order, the contents of the archive shifting according to the user's state of mind and desires each time it is used. The archive itself can be used for two purposes: to cast ancient spells and to divulge lore about hateful secrets and hidden horrors.  When using the anathema archive t o c ast s pells, t he u ser can either simply open it (in which case it randomly opens to one of the new Thassilonian spells presented earlier in this chapter) or the user can attempt to force the anathema archive to open to a specific spell from that list or to any arcane spell she knows how to cast. Doing so requires a Spellcraft check (DC = 20 + double spell level)-failure indicates the archive opens to a random spell from this chapter's seven earlier options. Whatever spell the anathema archive i s o pened t o, t he u ser may cast that spell from the scroll as if she were casting a spell from a normal scroll, save that the spell is not consumed from the anathema archive upon being cast.  When used for research, the anathema archive g rants a +10 insight bonus into any one Knowledge check associated with sinister or frightening ancient topics (subject to the GM's discretion-sample subjects include evil outsiders, runelords, Thassilon, Leng, evil religions, or undead). This allows a character to make the Knowledge skill check untrained.  Each time a character uses the anathema archive, her mind becomes increasingly haunted and unhinged. Upon using the archive, the user must make a Will save (DC = 15 + twice the total number of times the user has used the anathema archive). Failure results in the user taking 1d4 points of Wisdom drain and becoming confused for a number of rounds equal to 1 + the total number of times she has used the artifact.  The anathema archive closes automatically each time it is used, and cannot be opened again for 24 hours by any force.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>RotRL-AE-Appendix","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Anathema Archive","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"all schools"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"anathemaArchiveArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264647,"modifiedTime":1677435299224,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
{"_id":"6KaVhtv9GL8yRHFv","name":"Radiance [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_22.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>In 4692 AR, soon after the start of the Fourth Crusade, a paladin of Iomedae and renowned demon slayer named Yaniel spoke out against the Mendevian crusaders, accusing them of negligence and sloth, and claiming these faults were what allowed Khorramzadeh to invade Kenabres and damage the wardstone. Her accusations cut too close to the truth, and in a moment of weakness her superiors threatened to excommunicate her. Instead, she said she would enter the Worldwound and fight the Fourth Crusade on her own, with only her magic sword Radiance for company. The church was happy to see Yaniel go, and in the 2 years that followed, she was thought to have been slain. Yet when she returned to Kenabres in 4694 ar, leading a small army of crusaders she'd rescued, both Yaniel and her superiors had changed. For her part, Yaniel had shed her pride and insubordination, and had gained a new appreciation for the difficult decisions leaders are forced to make. And the church leaders had learned that sometimes the truth is exactly what you need to hear. Alas, Yaniel was assassinated before the year was out, slain by the lilitu demon Minagho only a week into her second personal crusade. Her followers managed to return to Kenabres with Radiance, but Yaniel's body had been taken. The sword had gone dark after Yaniel's death, its magical powers apparently lost, and so the crusaders elected to place it in the Gray Garrison on display. Yet several months ago it was stolen by the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth, who plan to soon send the sword north to Drezen for corruption into a weapon of evil.  Radiance was once a powerful weapon, yet since Yaniel's death the blade has become inert. When handled by a paladin, however, the blade suddenly glows with golden light and functions as a +1 cold iron longsword that radiates light as a torch on command. The weapon shifts and changes its form to match the paladin's deity's favored weapon (in the hands of a paladin who doesn't worship a deity, the weapon remains a +1 longsword). Certain events and tasks can awaken Radiance's latent powers, eventually transforming it into a full-fledged holy avenger-these events are noted in the following adventures in Wrath of the Righteous as they occur.  In addition, Radiance is a legendary item (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 169) that bonds with a mythic paladin a s soon as it is wielded in combat-in this adventure, Radiance bonds if a paladin uses it in the final encounter against Vorlesh's babaus. The weapon has two daily uses of legendary power that recharge each day, but does not currently possess any legendary attributes, for it has yet to be wielded by a mythic paladin. As Radiance has its own ability to grow in power, it cannot be given the upgradable legendary item ability.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +1 longsword|+1 cold iron longsword</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 73","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":4},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Radiance","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"abjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"radianceArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"weapon","equipmentSubtype":"lightArmor","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264651,"modifiedTime":1677435299224,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Unlike a normal staff, a staff of the magi holds 50 charges and cannot be recharged normally. Some of its powers use charges, while others don't. A staff of the magi does not lose its powers if it runs out of charges.  The following powers do not use charges:  • Detect magic  • Enlarge person (Fortitude DC 15 negates)  • Hold portal  • Light  • Mage armor  • Mage hand  The following powers drain 1 charge per usage:  • Dispel magic  • Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half)  • Ice storm  • Invisibility  • Knock  • Lightning bolt (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half)  • Passwall  • Pyrotechnics (Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates)  • Wall of fire  • Web  These powers drain 2 charges per usage:  • Monster summoning IX  • Plane shift (Will DC 21 negates)  • Telekinesis (400 lbs. maximum weight; Will DC 19 negates)  A staff of the magi gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does.

{"_id":"85MMCa4JZ5WFQTf6","name":"Sistrum Of Bastet [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The Sistrum of Bastet is a powerful artifact that, when used properly, allows a bard to use her bardic performance ability to enhance the spells of a divine spellcaster or conceal her true motives. Once per day, when the wielder uses the Sistrum of Bastet as part of a bardic performance, she can inspire a divine spellcaster within range of the performance and bolster the effects of any spells that spellcaster casts. Thereafter, for the duration of the performance, whenever the designated divine caster chooses to cast a spell, the bard can expend 1 or more rounds of bardic performance as an immediate action to enhance her allied divine spellcaster's spell as if that individual had prepared it with the Heighten Spell Metamagic Feat. The number of levels by which the divine spell is heightened is determined by the number of rounds of bardic performance sacrificed. For example, if the sistrum's player sacrifices 2 rounds of bardic performance, the divine caster's spell level increases by 2. A spell's level can never increase beyond 9th level, and can't be higher than the divine caster can cast.  Second, a bard wielding the Sistrum of Bastet can conceal the activity of casting a bard spell by masking it in a performance. As a swift action, the bard can combine her casting time for a spell with a Perform check. Observers must succeed at a Perception or Sense Motive check opposed by the user's Perform check to realize she is also casting a spell. This uses 1 round of her bardic performance ability, regardless of the spell's casting time. In addition, a bard using the Sistrum of Bastet can select a number of creatures equal to her level. The bard can deliver secret messages to these individuals without needing to use the Bluff skill. The bard still must be able to speak to deliver the message.  Finally, when the wielder gains a bard level and is able to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, she can choose a spell from the cleric spell list. This spell must be of the same level as the spell that she is replacing, and the bard casts that spell as a divine spell. If the Sistrum of Bastet ever leaves her possession for longer than 24 hours, any divine spells added in this way are lost unless she can reclaim the instrument.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 83","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Sistrum Of Bastet","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"sistrumOfBastetArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264662,"modifiedTime":1677435299224,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
{"_id":"8DcwlrzY8ktlZVQ4","name":"Nimbus Of Radiant Truth [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The Nimbus of Radiant Truth exists only when good has need of a great champion. Such a champion can attain it only though a perilous quest that tests mettle and righteousness. Rather than being a physical object, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth manifests as a glowing halo of light around the wearer's head. It's ordinarily as bright as continual flame, but in battle it brightens to the dazzling brilliance of daylight. Its radiance is treated as resulting from a 9th-level spell for purposes of interaction with other sources of light and darkness. The radiance of the nimbus can be suppressed or resumed as a standard action.  The Nimbus of Radiant Truth grants a +6 enhancement bonus to Wisdom and Charisma. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the nimbus is worn. Its wearer can't deliberately utter a lie, though the nimbus doesn't prevent other forms of deception, evasiveness, and giving incomplete answers within the boundaries of the truth. All of the wearer's natural weapons and any weapons she wields overcome damage reduction as though they were good-aligned. In addition, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth has the following powers.  • The wearer can bring forth a zone of truth (DC 20) with a 40- foot radius at will. By expending one use of mythic power, the DC increases to 30.  • As an immediate action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to gain the benefits of freedom's call (as the Liberation domain power) or nimbus of light (as the Sun domain power) for 2 minutes. For purposes of this power, the wearer has a cleric level equal to her character level. Either power can be dismissed as a free action, but any unused duration is lost.  • Seven times per day, the wearer can cure moderate wounds as a cleric with a caster level equal to her character level. The wearer adds her mythic tier to the hit points healed.  • Three times per day, the wearer can unleash a holy aura (DC 25) or an empowered holy smite (DC 22).  • Once per day, the wearer can unleash a blast of righteous power. Treat this as sunburst (DC 27) centered on the wearer, except that it has no effect on good-aligned creatures and inflicts double damage to evil-aligned creatures. After this power is used, the nimbus fades to a barely visible glow for 1 hour, and the wearer loses access to all of its powers save its enhancement bonuses. She remains unable to lie.  • Once per week, the wearer can expend one use of mythic power to perform a resurrection.  The wearer of the Nimbus of Radiant Truth can remove it as though it were a physical item, and place it either on the head of another creature or on an inanimate object. When placed on an inanimate object, the Nimbus of Radiant Truth can be picked up. When placed on a living creature, it can't be removed except by the wearer's conscious choice.  When donned by a creature of evil alignment, the nimbus blasts the creature for 20d6 points of damage, then teleports 1d10x10 miles away in a random direction. However, if the wearer becomes evil some time after donning it, the nimbus retains its powers and doesn't damage the wearer. The nimbus cannot be deceived by any mortal means of masking alignment (including mythic abilities).<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Mythic Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Nimbus Of Radiant Truth","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"evocation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"nimbusOfRadiantTruthArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"headband","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264664,"modifiedTime":1677435299224,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

{"_id":"9GH19npR1j51Vczy","name":"Cubic Spiral [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The cubic spiral regulates the environment around it when directed by a knowledgeable operator. Shallow gouges on one side of the block serve as a bed in which up to 20 tiny clusters of cubic minerals blossom and grow. Plucking a cluster is a standard action, and plucked clusters regrow on the relic in 1 month. Plucked clusters have no powers of their own, but inserting a cluster into one of the six holes in the cubic spiral as a standard action activates one of the artifact's functions. Once a user activates a function of the cubic spiral, the function remains active until complete (if a limitation is specified below), until the user commands the artifact to cease its function, or until the user is no longer within 1,000 feet. Except for the diminution function, the cubic spiral can engage in only one function at a time.  Diminution (front facing, smallest hole): The cubic spiral shrinks to any size between its full size and 1 foot in height, as commanded. The weight of the artifact decreases proportionally with its height; at its smallest size, it weighs 150 pounds.  Drill (front facing, middle hole): This function activates only if the cubic spiral is at its smallest size. The cubic spiral spins and pushes its way relentlessly in an indicated direction, boring an 18-inch-diameter hole into solid objects at a rate of 10 feet per round. The cubic spiral can bore through any material with a hardness of less than 20. Creatures can move easily out of the way of the spinning artifact, but those that don't take 20d6 points of slashing damage (no save). The user indicates a maximum distance when this function is activated, up to 1,000 feet. Once it has reached this distance, or if it cannot proceed to the full distance, the cubic spiral returns to the user through the borehole.  Slide (front facing, largest hole): The cubic spiral slides rapidly in an indicated direction at a speed of 100 feet per round. This movement need not be along the ground, as the artifact can slide through the air or across water. The cubic spiral deals 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage to creatures and objects in its path (Reflex DC 20 negates). If it's not at its full size, reduce the damage dealt by 1d6 for each foot smaller than its full size. The user indicates a maximum distance when this function is activated, up to 1,000 feet. The cubic spiral's slide stops at the end of this distance or if it encounters a wall or other impassable object. If airborne at the end of its slide, it falls but takes no damage regardless of the distance fallen.  Temperature Regulation (rear facing, smallest hole): The cubic spiral radiates waves of heat or cold to adjust the temperature within 1,000 feet. The user indicates a temperature between -20° F and 140° F, and the artifact maintains that temperature within the area.  Tornado (rear facing, middle hole): The cubic spiral spins quickly in place, creating an effect like a stationary tornado (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 439) within 100 feet and creating severe winds within 1,000 feet.  Vacuum (rear facing, largest hole): The cubic spiral destroys all air adjacent to it each round. Creatures adjacent to the artifact can't speak, use breath weapons, cast spells with verbal components, or do anything else that requires breathing. If the cubic spiral is in a sealed chamber, air-breathing creatures in the chamber eventually suffocate.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 120","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":20},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Cubic Spiral","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"all schools"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"cubicSpiralArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264673,"modifiedTime":1677435299225,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Strangely, Demonbane was created not by paladins or clerics of good, but rather by the arch-devil, Baalzebul, who proposed to overthrow the Lord of the Undead. Because of their mutual evil alignments, the sword focuses on law versus chaos. Also, because the archdevil did not particularly care who used the sword against Orcus, he made it lawful neutral, rather than lawful evil. This sword functions as a +3 cold iron axiomatic keen bastard sword, the wielder gains a +4 insight bonus on all saves against attacks from demons, the sword automatically ignores the damage reduction of any demon it strikes, and the wielder of Demonbane is immune to the wand of Orcus. If used against a devil (or any other lawful evil outsider), the sword becomes powerless and nonmagical for 24 hours. Once in the possession of a lawful-aligned PC, the sword urges its wielder toward that end. It knows Orcus is near and can guide the PC by letting him know if he is getting closer or further away from the Demon Prince. If the wielder does not proceed directly toward Orcus, Demonbane asks (it speaks Common and Draconic) to be handed over to a more dedicated warrior. If this fails, it attempts to control the PC (DC 27 Will save resists). A controlled PC follows Demonbane's directions and is allowed an additional saving throw every 24 hours.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +3 cold iron axiomatic keen bastard sword</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Rappan Athuk","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":7},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Demonbane","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"evocation and transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"demonbaneArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264675,"modifiedTime":1677435299225,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The large crystal composing the spear's head is mounted on a 5-foot shaft of lightweight metal that swirls with a complex pattern that every so often appears to shift. A ring designed to fit a dozen smaller teardrop-shaped crystals connects the base of the spear's head to the shaft, although only seven of the 12 sockets contain a crystal. Each of these smaller crystals is about an inch long and angles slightly outward on one side of the ring to act like barbs when the spear is lodged deeply in flesh. Each of these crystals pulses with a warm amber light. Any xiomorn within 1 mile of the spear of shards is automatically aware of its presence, as well as the distance and direction to the artifact.  Each of the smaller crystals is attuned to a different Vault beneath Golarion. When the wielder of the spear of shards rhythmically taps one of these smaller crystals as a full-round action, the spear identifies the path to the attuned Vault and can direct its wielder unerringly to the Vault, as per find the path. This effect lasts until the spear reaches the attuned Vault or until the crystal at the head of the spear is tapped in the same manner. The five missing crystals are lost but, if rediscovered, could be attached to the spear of shards and reveal the way to their attuned Vaults as well.  The spear of shards has sufficient intelligence to remain staunchly loyal to its xiomorn creators. If wielded by a non-xiomorn, it either refuses to provide directions or intentionally provides erroneous directions to keep the wielder away from the Vaults. If used by a non-xiomorn in combat, the spear of shards damages the wielder rather than the target on any attack roll that is a natural 1, as a cursed backbiter spear. When the spear of shards is used by a non-xiomorn in combat against a xiomorn, any attack roll other than a natural 20 results in an attack against the wielder instead. A non-xiomorn can use the Use Magic Device skill to emulate a xiomorn and trick the spear of shards, but the DC of this check is increased by 10 (to DC 35) to reflect the spear's suspicion.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +6 returning wounding spear</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 120","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":10},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Spear Of Shards","cl":18,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"divination"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"spearOfShardsArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264681,"modifiedTime":1677435299225,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The sphere must be created around an area of  normal, safe air, of a size selected by the user when the sphere is created, between 100 feet and 1 mile in diameter.

When she did this, fragments of the world turned molten by her blade flew from the battle, landing in remote parts of Golarion where they cooled and transformed into these potent scimitars. The weapons were sought out by her church and were entrusted to her greatest champions. Over time, though, those champions fell and the blades were lost.  A Dawnflower's Kiss is a +4 holy flaming scimitar. Once per round as a standard action, the wielder can slash at the air with a Dawnflower's Kiss to fire a single bolt of searing light from the weapon. Once per day, the wielder may instead unleash a sunbeam with this standard action. In the hands of a worshiper of Sarenrae, the scimitar becomes a +5 holy flaming burst scimitar that functions as a divine focus for spellcasting. If used as a divine focus, the scimitar increases the save DC for the spell cast by 1. Finally, by expending one use of mythic power, a worshiper of Sarenrae can as a standard action throw the sword to make a single attack against up to eight targets within 60 feet of her-these attacks resolve as melee attacks made at the worshiper's highest attack bonus.  The Dawnflower's Kiss found in this adventure was claimed long ago by Baphomet from a paladin of Sarenrae after her husband betrayed her to the Horned Lord. The blade has been corrupted-it now functions as a +4 unholy flaming scimitar, and none of its other powers function at all until it is cleansed, such as through the redeemed corruption forge back in Drezen or a miracle spell, or by bringing the scimitar to the unquiet shade of Lady Cessily Mantiel in area H2. When handed the weapon, she sighs in relief and infuses the blade with her spirit, restoring it to full functionality while simultaneously releasing her spirit from the prison.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +4 holy flaming scimitar|+5 holy flaming burst scimitar</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 77","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":4},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Dawnflower's Kiss","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"evocation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"dawnflowersKissArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"weapon","equipmentSubtype":"lightArmor","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264692,"modifiedTime":1677435299226,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

A long cord bound to the plank through a hole at the top of the blade allows the bearer to whirl the blade about in a circle, causing it to emit a low, growling tone with a strange warble that can be heard many miles away.   In the hands of a mythic creature, whirling bullroarers can induce powerful sonic waves that trigger profound emotional reactions in anyone they touch. A mythic creature can attempt to spin up to two bullroarers at a time, provided he has a free hand for each. Spinning more than two bullroarers creates a cacophony that causes their effects to cancel each other out. The penetrating sonic waves don't need to be audible to be effective, however they can't affect creatures immune to mind-affecting effects.

These grim statuettes appear as skull-topped fortresses the size of a clenched fist. When activated by speaking a command word, a bone house grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement on top. The bone walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress-even knock spells can't open the door.  The bone walls are magically enhanced to be as hard as stone, and have 100 hit points and hardness 10. A bone house can be repaired by casting inflict spells on the walls, with every 10 points of negative energy repairing 1 point of damage. A bone house springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone caught in the area takes 10d6 points of damage (DC 19 Reflex save for half damage). The interior of a bone house is under the constant effects of a desecrate spell and is considered an altar to Zon-Kuthon for the purposes of determining the desecrate modifiers.  Once a bone house is expanded into tower size, its owner can create up to four mummies per month from the drifts of bone ash and detritus that litter the inner rooms. Creating a mummy in this manner takes 10 minutes, and the owner must be inside of the bone house the entire time. Due to the desecrate effect, mummies created inside gain +2 hit points per Hit Die. These undead guard the contents of the bone house without needing to be commanded. If the owner wishes to command these mummies to perform other tasks, he must use other means to do so. No more than four mummies may be active at one time.  A bone house is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Artifacts and Legends","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Bone House","cl":17,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration and necromancy"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"boneHouseArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264703,"modifiedTime":1677435299226,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

{"_id":"C1vJd6cxR1FgYnh0","name":"Celestial Lens [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The celestial lens is a 12-foot-diameter lens mounted in a rune-covered circular frame of strange, alien metal, floating in a permanent orbit around a temple dedicated to the sun. Several smaller lenses of similar design hover around the primary lens like a bizarre orrery, moving into place to focus the arcane rays of the device. The celestial lens was c reated to capture the light of sacred eclipses and solar conjunctions, as well as the refracted darkness found between stars.   Celestial rays can be directed in an extremely powerful beam of energy that manifests as a vertical column of searing light focused directly below the celestial lens. Depending on the will of the controller and GM adjudication for inclement weather, such blasts deal between 5d6 and 20d6 points of damage in a 5-foot-radius cylinder extending from the lens to the ground or target. During the day, half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. At night, the device focuses distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset. The lens moves with a constant speed of 20 feet and damages everything caught in the affected areas each round. Victims may make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage.   The lens orbits at a static height of 100 feet from the ground and moves at a speed of 20 feet per round. It cannot be stopped or accelerated, although the path of the transit can be altered by a user in possession of the flame of guidance. When not directed, the lens maintains its last commanded path, eventually curving into a new elliptical orbit around its temple, scorching a path through whatever lies below. The user can alter both the damage (up to the maximum for the current lighting conditions) and the orbit in any direction, but the lens must move 20 feet each round, and cannot travel more than 3 miles from the temple in any direction before it curves back around and begins returning. Only divine intervention or powerful magic like wish or miracle can overcome this limited range, making a new person or place the center of the lens's orbit.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Ultimate Equipment","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2400},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Celestial Lens","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"evocation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"celestialLensArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264707,"modifiedTime":1677435299226,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The amulet found in this adventure is associated with Baphomet, and as such it grants the following boons (see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lords of Chaos, Book of the Damned, Vol. 2 for details on other demon lords' boons):  • Beast shape I, misdirection, and summon monster I at will.  • Once per day, the wearer can change shape into a minotaur for 1 hour, gaining a +4 size bonus to Strength and taking a -2 penalty to Charisma. If the wearer is actually a minotaur, she can instead assume a humanoid form at will; this change of form does not alter the wearer's ability scores.  • Extended maze 1/day.  Additionally, the wearer of the amulet gains a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor, immunity to electricity and poison, and resistance 10 to acid, cold, and fire.

The invention of the first wardstones, giant menhirs infused with holy magic meant to contain and repel demonic creatures, was perhaps the greatest result of the crusader's initial response to Sarkoris's destruction. Today, dozens of wardstones stand sentinel along the borders of the Worldwound.  The primary purpose of the wardstones is to contain the growing influence of the Worldwound itself, but they also exude a powerful field similar to that generated by a forbiddance spell. A single wardstone exerts this aura in a 300-foot radius, but when multiple wardstones are linked (as in the case of those running along the border of the Worldwound), they create a 300-footwide path of forbiddance, with the wardstones running down the middle. The forbiddance area, be it a radius or path, deals 12d6 points of damage per round to any demon within that area (DC 18 Will save half; spell resistance applies). Teleportation effects do not function in this zone at all. The wardstones that bolster the eastern and southern borders of the Worldwound have a further effect as well-focused on the Worldwound as they are, they prevent demons from teleporting into or out of the Worldwound and effectively contain the threat.

Alteration in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it off and later puts it on again, another save is required.

The sleeping creature can resist this doom by making a DC 20 Will save-with a success, he is afflicted by a nightmare spell (CL 20th) but is otherwise unharmed. If he fails the save, his dreaming mind is stolen, warped, and then siphoned back into his body in the space of an hour. If the victim is awakened before this process completes, his body twists and transforms into a creature known as a dream eater (see above), at which point only wish or miracle (or the destruction of the Gem of Dreams) can restore him to his true form. At the point the transformation occurs, the creature that activated the gem's power ceases to age for a month. By using the gem every month (and creating more and more dream eaters), a person can effectively become immortal in this manner.

The rod cannot be opened except as part of the process to destroy it, as described below. When the Pauper's Thighbone is picked up, the new wielder immediately understands all of the powers and limitations of the artifact.   When held like a rod, the Pauper's Thighbone can be used to enhance a spell with a metamagic feat the wielder already knows. The wielder can apply any one of her metamagic feats to a spell she casts without increasing the spell's casting time or the spell slot required. Enhancing a spell this way expends a number of the golden runes adorning the rod equal to the level increase of the spell normally required by the metamagic feat (for example, maximizing a spell with the Maximize Spell feat expends three golden runes). Enhancing a spell does not require an action and is performed as part of the casting time of the spell. Expended runes fade from bright gold to dull silver. Silver runes cannot be used to enhance spells, but they regain their golden color, and can be used again, at dawn each day.   As the Pauper's Thighbone bears nine runes, it can be used to apply up to nine spell levels of increases daily. At the GM's discretion, if the artifact's owner intentionally ignores an opportunity to perform a selfless or generous act, one of the rod's runes flickers and permanently disappears, reflecting the paucity of the owner's soul. Inversely, if the owner of the Pauper's Thighbone performs a particularly generous act (such as giving away a large percentage of her wealth to the needy), an additional special rune might permanently appear on the rod.   When possessed by an evil creature, the Pauper's Thighbone instead burdens its owner with the weight of his sins. In this case, the Pauper's Thighbone grants none of its powers and acts as a stone of weight. The rod can only be removed from an evil owner's possession if the owner dies or if the owner willingly gives the rod to a nonevil creature, and the nonevil creature willingly accepts it.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 74","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":4},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Pauper's Thighbone","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"paupersThighboneArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264727,"modifiedTime":1677435299228,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
{"_id":"DrURI8rWgYgTR04Y","name":"Trueforge [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Formed of meteoric adamantine, the massive anvil known as the Trueforge appears and vanishes according to unknowable whims-perhaps those of a greater power, perhaps its own. A creature with sufficient power and knowledge can bind the Trueforge to a fixed location to best take advantage of its power.   Labor at the Trueforge requires both supreme skill and mythic power. Non-mythic creatures are affected as the feeblemind spell (DC 30) for daring to use the forge, and can't use the forge's abilities even if they succeed at their saving throws.   When toiling at the Trueforge, a mythic creature can create magical weapons and armor with a cost up to her mythic tier squared times 2,000 gp, ignoring the nonmagical cost of the item created. For example, a 10th-tier character could craft a magic weapon of a +10 enhancement equivalent, worth 200,000 gp plus the cost of the weapon itself. The item forged must be at least partially metal, such as a breastplate or spear. Creating such an item requires only half the usual value of raw materials. However, to create items involving exotic materials (such as adamantine), the creator must use and have access to the normal amount of the material.   Regardless of the materials involved, it takes 1 day of labor to forge a nonmagical light or one-handed weapon, shield, or suit of light armor; 2 days to forge a suit of medium armor or two-handed weapon; and 3 days to forge a suit of heavy armor. For items with magical properties, square the number of days of labor and multiply by 1,000 to determine the total gold piece value. For example, completing an item with magical properties worth 144,000 gp or less requires 12 days of work. The crafter must labor continuously on the item, not sleeping until work is completed, though she's kept awake and vigorous through the magic of the forge. If the work is interrupted for more than 1 hour at a time or more than 2 hours in a single day, the item is ruined, and half the value of the raw materials wasted.   In addition to making normal and magical weapons and armor, the Trueforge can repair a broken magic item, generally in half the number of days it would take to make it from scratch. It can even repair or create an artifact, though such a task requires months of preparation to gather the proper materials followed by weeks of labor at the forge.   Only one person can work the forge at a time. As the crafter labors, the Trueforge feeds on her mythic power and life energy, drawing it into the item forged. Forging nonmagical items carries less risk. The crafter must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save at the start of each day of work or gain 2 permanent negative levels. For magic items, the save DC is equal to 25 plus the number of days worked thus far. At the start of each day of labor, the crafter must expend a number of uses of mythic power equal to the number of days worked so far plus one.   If the crafter accumulates a number of negative levels equal to her own character level or exhausts her mythic power, the labor proves fatal at the end of the day. Normally, this ruins the work in progress, but if this occurs on the final day of work, the crafter finishes the item as she dies. Her soul enters the item, making it an intelligent item with the crafter's personality-and likely some of her abilities, as determined by the GM.   Creatures immune to level drain, whether by innate nature or magical protection, can't use the Trueforge.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Mythic Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":500},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Trueforge","cl":25,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"trueforgeArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264729,"modifiedTime":1677435299228,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
{"_id":"EJpjL4Ewl9XGhmGA","name":"Book Of The Damned: Complete [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The Book of the Damned contains the multiverse's single greatest collection of profane lore, detailing the evil planes and their denizens with an audacious comprehensiveness beyond that which a tome of its size should be able to physically contain. This blasphemous book consists of numerous scattered chapters divided into three volumes-daemonic, demonic, and diabolic. Should all chapters of those three volumes be united in their entirety, the completed compilation exhibits the following abilities.  The complete Book of the Damned radiates a permanent unhallow effect in a 150-foot radius and a sympathy effect tuned to attract all evil creatures. Any creature of good alignment that willingly touches the tome must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be immediately slain. Additionally, while the Book of the Damned is outside of its repository (see below), any evil being of demigod-level power (daemonic harbingers, demon lords, infernal dukes) or greater using scry or a similar spell can view the Book of the Damned with no risk of being detected by the bearer. Finally, any creatures that make use of any of the tome's abilities are damned, condemned to one of the Lower Planes after death regardless of their deeds. Only the intervention of a deity can prevent this punishment.  The complete compilation of the Book of the Damned can be used in multiple ways-as a profane talisman, as an obscene reference volume, and as a gate to the multiverse's most complete repository of unholy lore.  Talisman: As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all spells with the evil descriptor as if she were two caster levels higher and gains a +5 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks made when interacting with evil outsiders. The bearer can also make use of the following spell-like abilities:  At will-align weapon (evil only), bestow curse, detect evil, speak with dead  3/day-banishment, blasphemy, dictum, magic circle, unhallow, unholy aura, unholy blight, word of chaos  1/day-dimensional lock, gate, greater planar binding, soul bind  Reference: Any character who can read Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal and who spends a total of 30 days (not necessarily contiguously) studying the tome learns soul-tainting secrets- the ultimate blasphemies of all creation. The bearer gains a +10 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks whenever she consults the book for 1 hour regarding a question. Additionally, the book's  descriptions of Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell prove so vivid that any teleportation to or within those planes always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). The bearer of the Book of the Damned also gains a +5 bonus on the opposed Charisma check required by the planar binding spell (this bonus stacks with the +5 bonus the tome grants on interactions with evil outsiders).  Once per day, the bearer can ask the tome a question relating to any profane topic; she then opens the book to a random page to find the answer, revealed as if the bearer had cast vision.  The book also contains a copy of every spell with the evil spell descriptor.  Repository: Once per day, the bearer of the Book of the Damned can cause the tome to disappear into its own internal demiplane, leaving behind a sinister shimmering portal. This reproduces the effects of a mage's magnificent mansion spell, allowing the bearer and those she chooses to enter an unnerving but semi-safe library filled with the countless volumes of blasphemous records the Book of the Damned merely serves as a window upon. The book and those within the repository are affected by a powerful nondetection effect, shielding all within from the sight of even the gods. Creatures do not age while inside, although upon leaving, they immediately age an amount equal to the time spent inside. While within the demiplane, visitors may access any of the powers described in the Reference section.  Creatures of nonevil alignment find the macabre surroundings and frightening servants within the repository unsettling, and must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be afflicted as if by the nightmare spell every time they attempt to rest within. Nothing can prevent this effect.  The entrance to the Book of the Damned's repository can be entered by creatures other than those the bearer chooses on certain nights, specifically during lunar eclipses and the midnight hour on the night of a new moon, during which time the barely visible portal manifests as a normal door.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Artifacts and Legends","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":40},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Book Of The Damned: Complete","cl":25,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"all schools [chaotic lawful evil]"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"bookOfTheDamnedCompleteArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264730,"modifiedTime":1677435299228,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Every round the seated creature speaks (a standard action), all creatures with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher within 100 feet must succeed at a Will save or be compelled to listen, becoming vulnerable to its blasphemies. The save DC is equal to 10 + the seated creature's Charisma modifier + 1/2 its Hit Dice. Deafened creatures, or those immune to sonic mind-affecting effects, are not considered to be listening.  The seated creature can then use its speech to affect listeners as if by the following spells: confusion (as a 4th-level spell), crushing despair (as a 4th-level spell), enthrall, modify memory, or suggestion (as a 3rd-level spell). The seated creature can affect multiple victims with different spell effects in the same round. The DC to resist these spells is equal to the original DC from above + the mimicked spell's level. Victims still receive saving throws against these effects, but if they fail their saves, they are not aware that the throne is working its power on them.  Any victim that succeeds at its saving throw against a particular spell effect is immune to that effect for the next 24 hours. However, it can still be affected by the throne's other spell effects.

The goblet is always filled to the brim with wine. Any drops spilling from the cup vanish into nothingness before they touch the ground.  Once per day, the cup grants a permanent +1d4 insight bonus on all Knowledge checks to a creature that drinks from it, but it permanently reduces the drinker's Wisdom score by the same amount. If your campaign uses the sanity rules (see page 12), this  instead reduces the drinker's sanity score by double the amount. The bonus on Knowledge checks and reduction to Wisdom stack with multiple drinks from the same cup, but the bonus can never exceed +10. If the insight bonus ever becomes greater than the drinker's Intelligence modifier or reaches +10, she must succeed at a Will save with a DC equal to 20 + the amount by which the insight bonus exceeds her Intelligence modifier (or DC 20 if the bonus reaches +10 but she has an Intelligence modifier of +10 or greater). If the user fails, she becomes insane (as per insanity). Even if the user succeeds, the inescapable feeling of knowing too much continues to vex her, and she must repeat the saving throw once per day. Only spells that can remove insanity can put her mind at ease. However, curing the effect (or the insanity that it causes) permanently removes the insight bonus and Wisdom reduction and makes the user unable to ever again be affected by a cup of forbidden knowledge.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Horror Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Cup Of Forbidden Knowledge","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"divination"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"cupOfForbiddenKnowledgeArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264735,"modifiedTime":1677435299228,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

When driven into the wall of a building, a maleficus spike infuses the walls of the structure with a dimensional lock effect and a ward that repels evil outsiders. Any outsider with the evil subtype that tries to enter or damage the warded building must attempt a DC 30 Will save. If it fails, the outsider takes 12d6 points of damage and becomes nauseated for 1 hour. An outsider that remains inside a building warded in this manner must make a new Will save each round to avoid damage and nausea. The effect is lessened against non-outsider evil creatures, but they too are affected-such creatures gain a +4 bonus on their Will saves, take only 4d6 points of damage on a failed save, and are nauseated for only 1 minute.  The stone and doors of a structure warded by a maleficus spike are considered to be magically treated (+20 to Break DCs, double hardness, and double hit points). Additionally, the structure self-repairs damage at the rate of 5 points of damage per round, provided the damage was inflicted while the maleficus spike was functioning; the spike can't repair existing damage when it is installed.  A maleficus spike consumes an enormous amount of magical energy. It contains enough energy to ward a structure for 24 hours, after which it becomes dormant until recharged. Recharging a maleficus spike requires a spellcaster to spend 10 minutes in contact with the spike, after which the spellcaster selects a number of spell slots totaling no fewer than 24 spell levels to expend to infuse the artifact with enough energy to ward the structure for another 24 hours. Prepared spells in these slots are lost for a day, and for spontaneous spellcasters those slots are used for a day.

To perform the resurrection ritual, the tablet must be placed the upon the individual's chest at dusk; when the first rays of the rising sun to touch the deceased individual's face, he awakens.  During the ritual, the deceased person experiences a powerful vision in which he enters the divine court of Namrut, a blue-skinned Osirian man with lotus flowers blossoming from his head and palms. Hundreds of white and blue lotus flowers float in the pools that line the stone pathways of Namrut's courtyard. Namrut offers the individual the blessing of life; in return he asks that he not be forgotten. If the individual accepts, Namrut graciously returns him to life per resurrection. When the individual wakes, he discovers that the back of his neck has been marked with the symbol of Namrut's white lotus. The marking is permanent and cannot be removed by any means short of a miracle or wish. Thereafter, provided the individual keeps his promise to remember Namrut, the lotus grants the marked character a number of spell-like abilities.  A number of times per day equal to 1 + the marked character's Wisdom modifier (minimum 1), the marked character can perform a lotus ritual to simulate the effects of one of the following spells: cure critical wounds, neutralize poison, remove blindness/deafness, remove disease, or restoration. Performing the lotus ritual requires a full 10 minutes of prayer, during which the marked individual can not be interrupted.

{"_id":"HDSU4JhyDYeaGXq4","name":"Book Of The Damned: Daemonic [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The original Book of the Damned was collected from the scattered records of the exiled angel Tabris, who was ordered to record the lore of all the multiverse but was cast out of Heaven for his findings. The daemonic chapters of the Book of the Damned are bound between covers of perpetually frozen and compressed ashes that seem to suck away ambient light into their material.  All known copies of the text appear to be some variety of palimpsest, with the words written over the intentionally erased words of an earlier draft, though it is unknown when and by whom this redaction took place. In each case, the edited portions describe specific names relating to the earliest history of the plane, sometimes with entire pages being censored. Scholars suspect this is related to the same magic utilized by the Horsemen to scour their own records and history in cycles when one of the Four has been replaced. Any good-aligned creature who touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains one negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Creatures attempting to read the book that are not neutral evil must make a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward neutral evil.  Written in a mixture of Abyssal and Infernal, sometimes changing from one to the other mid-sentence, the text requires true fluency in both languages to fully understand the nuances and true meaning of the text. As a reader proceeds, he becomes aware of a dull pressure on the back of his skull and a buzzing static. Eventually the text begins to speak to him, inserting telepathic impressions and images to complement the text. A telepathic creature may read the text without actually opening the book merely by holding it and concentrating.  A reader who splashes his own blood onto the book (which is promptly absorbed) and spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the book receives several benefits.  The book contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as all of the spells on pages 38-39 and those listed below. The user gains at +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks when using the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of Abaddon are so accurate that any teleportation to or within that plane always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). Any energy-draining spell cast by the bearer bestows +1 additional negative level on affected creatures.  The daemonic portion of the Book of the Damned serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy attuned to attract neutral evil creatures. As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all evil spells as if he were two caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with neutral evil creatures. Four times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, circle of death, energy drain, death knell, soul bind, or soul transfer (see page 39). It is believed that the bearer can be scried at any time, without a saving throw, by the Four Horsemen or their elite agents.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Horsemen Of The Apocalypse","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":12},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Book Of The Damned: Daemonic","cl":25,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"all schools [evil]"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"bookOfTheDamnedDaemonicArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264773,"modifiedTime":1677435299230,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

First and foremost, Minderhal's Forge functions as an altar of Minderhal (see page 246 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Gods for rules on a ltars). Any creature (not just a worshiper of Minderhal) can pray at the altar, though accepting the altar's blessing is both an evil and lawful act. Praying at the altar grants a +2 circumstance bonus on Craft and Sense Motive checks, or one of the following weapon special abilities (creature's choice) to one magic weapon carried or wielded by the creature: axiomatic or unholy. This effect is suppressed if the weapon leaves the creature's grasp, but resumes if the weapon is returned to the creature.  Minderhal's Forge is also a fully working forge. Any creature using the forge can create magic weapons, armor, or shields as if it possessed the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat. If the creature already has that feat, the forge grants a +5 circumstance bonus on the Craft check needed to create a magic weapon, armor, or shields. Crafting any sort of item, whether magical or otherwise, using Minderhal's Forge takes half the normal amount of time.  In addition, Minderhal's Forge has 10 charges, which renew at the beginning of each day. A creature using Minderhal's Forge can expend the listed number of charges to activate one of the following spell-like abilities as a full-round action, which can affect targets within 10 feet of the forge.  • Bull's strength (1 charge)  • Magic weapon (1 charge)  • Make whole (1 charge)  • Fabricate (3 charges)  • Major creation (3 charges)  • Stone shape (3 charges)  • Stoneskin (3 charges)  • Iron body (5 charges)  • Stone to flesh (5 charges)  Lastly, Minderhal's Forge can be used in conjunction with Agrimmosh, the Hammer of Unmaking (Pathfinder Adventure Path #91: Battle of Bloodmarch Hill 56) to resize armor and weapons. When a weapon, suit of armor, or shield is placed in Minderhal's Forge and struck with Agrimmosh, the equipment permanently resizes to match the size of Agrimmosh's wielder. This power is so strong that magic or even intelligent items are always affected; only artifacts receive a saving throw (Will DC 25 negates) to resist this effect.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 93","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Minderhal's Forge","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"transmutation [evil lawful]"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"minderhalsForgeArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264779,"modifiedTime":1677435299230,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Many of these minor runewells of wrath existed in her domain-though today most are lost deep under the waters of the Varisian Gulf or are hidden away in Hollow Mountain, with only the one remaining on mainland Avistan hidden in the Catacombs of Wrath under Sandpoint.  Every time a creature with a wrathful soul (including most goblins and quite a few of the victims murdered years ago by Jervas Stoot) dies within a mile of a minor runewell, it gains 1 wrath point. There's no limit to the number of wrath points the minor runewell can store, but it currently contains only 20. Each time the well's waters are drawn upon (as detailed below), a number of wrath points are expended. If enough points are expended to put its total at 0 or negative wrath points, the minor runewell deactivates, its waters fading away. Reactivating the minor runewell requires long-lost rituals-or the reactivation of a major runewell somewhere else in the world. Such an event restores a minor runewell of wrath to a starting level of 3 wrath points.  A minor runewell is only 3 feet deep, yet any living creature that enters its freezing orange waters immediately takes 2d6 points of cold damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be overcome with wrath. Failure indicates the creature becomes enraged (as if under the effects of a rage spell) and immediately attacks the nearest living creature. If no living creatures are in sight, the enraged creature is compelled to seek out a victim, moving at full speed in its search. This rage persists for 2d6 minutes, after which point the creature becomes fatigued. Each activation of a minor runewell in this manner costs 3 wrath points.  A minor runewell can also be commanded to disgorge a sinspawn. To manifest a sinspawn, a creature need only allow a few drops of its blood to fall into the pool. One round later, a sinspawn emerges from the well and immediately attacks the closest creature in which it cannot scent wrath.

Each end is capped with a smooth copper sphere. While holding the rod, the bearer automatically perceives any spell cast (or spell-like ability used) within a 120-foot radius, even if she can't otherwise perceive the caster. Spells cast from spell completion and spell trigger items are automatically detected as well. The bearer immediately knows the specific spell cast, whether or not it was from a magic item, its level, the caster level, and whether the spell is arcane or divine.   When the bearer of the rod of spell sundering counters a spell, she can counterspell with any spell of equal or greater level she's prepared, automatically countering as if she'd cast the proper spell to counterspell. As an immediate action after countering a spell, the rod's wielder can expend one use of mythic power to reflect the spell back on the caster. The rod's bearer must have line of effect to reflect a spell, unless the spell reflected doesn't require it. Treat the caster as the target, center, or origin of the spell's effect, as appropriate. Treat the spell as though cast by the rod's bearer on the caster. The power of the rod of spell sundering augments the spell, increasing the DC of any saving throws by 2 and the spell's caster level by the bearer's tier.

{"_id":"JCLglEHPQ2AL8cDs","name":"Lens Of Galundari [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>At its most basic level, the Lens of Galundari functions as the focal point for an inward-facing magic circle spell of the user's choice. The magic circle varies in radius, but can hold one outsider called into its space by the spell planar binding, regardless of its size. While the lens improves the effectiveness of the spell planar binding, it does not actually cast the spell, requiring some outside agency to cast the spell while employing the lens as an additional focus component. The target of the planar binding receives its normal Will save to resist, but once it appears within the lens's magic circle, it cannot escape-the lens prevents the outsider from using its spell resistance or Charisma to escape, and locks it in place as per the spell dimensional anchor. Once trapped within the lens's magic circle, an outsider is trapped indefinitely, until it agrees to the user's demands or a sentient creature touches the prison with intent to free the outsider-doing so releases the outsider immediately. Even rolls of 1 on Charisma checks to coerce the outsider into service do not free the outsider.  While the lens does not grant the user a bonus on Charisma checks made to influence creatures trapped within its prison, it does grant the user an additional use for the outsider: The outsider can be bound within the lens, transforming the artifact into an arcane engine of sorts. The user must compel the outsider to submit to this service, as described by the spell planar binding. The outsider receives a +10 bonus on the opposed Charisma check made to resist entering into service. This bonus is reduced by 1 for every week the outsider remains bound (minimum 0). The lens can only hold one outsider at a time, and it cannot employ its magic circle effect while an outsider is trapped within.  If an outsider agrees to be bound into the lens, it becomes trapped inside the lens and cannot free itself. While bearing the lens, the wielder can employ any of the outsider's spell-like abilities. How often the wielder can use these spell-like abilities is limited by the outsider's Hit Dice and the frequency with which the imprisoned outsider can normally use its spell-like abilities. The outsider's Hit Dice become a pool of soul points the wielder has access to, with each Hit Die equating to 1 soul point. The lens's bearer can employ the imprisoned outsider's spell-like abilities by spending a number of soul points equal to the spell-like ability's spell level. If the lens no longer has enough soul points to pay for a spell-like ability's use, the ability cannot be used. If the imprisoned outsider can only use a spell-like ability a certain number of times in an amount of time, the wielder cannot employ that spell-like ability more than that number of times in the amount of time specified, even if the lens has enough soul points to pay for the ability's use. The lens's total number of soul points replenishes every day.  The outsider within the lens can be freed by spending 1 soul point. The released outsider is exhausted, but is not controlled by the lens's bearer. The outsider within the lens can also communicate telepathically with a creature touching the artifact, though it exerts no control over the bearer.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Artifacts and Legends","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":10},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Lens Of Galundari","cl":22,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"abjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"lensOfGalundariArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264787,"modifiedTime":1677435299230,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The unwieldy, 5-foot-tall device rests suspended on an iron stand fitted with pivots that allow its user to rotate a central chamber of etched, smoke-colored glass. To operate the device, the user must place the ashes of a Small, Medium, or Large sentient creature into the glass chamber along with a crushed onyx worth 100 gp. After the ashes have flowed through the chamber three times-a process that takes 3 hours-the contents can be emptied. If deposited into a clay pot filled with grave dirt and brackish water, the ashes transform the mundane container into a shadow urn. A creature whose remains have been defiled in this way cannot be restored to life by any method short of a miracle or wish until the shadow urn containing its spirit has been destroyed.  A shadow urn contains an unquiet spirit befouled by the Hourglass of Shadows. These fragile urns can be thrown, have a range increment of 10 feet, and shatter on contact with any creature or solid surface. When a shadow urn is broken, the single greater shadow contained within is released. This shadow is free-willed-owing no allegiance to the owner of the Hourglass of Shadows or whoever broke its urn-and typically attacks the nearest creature, seeking to sate its hunger for life energy. A shadow urn is destroyed when it is used.

The portal on the opposite side operates in the same fashion, but is immobile.  Beyond the portal, the Isle of Seven Chains is a meteor-like ball of crumbling bricks and ancient, rusted metal.  Tethered to it are several orbiting ruins, the most prominent of which bear soulgates connecting to Axis, Dis, the Elemental Plane of Water, the sahkil tormentor Dachzerul's realm on the Ethereal Plane, a supposedly empty rift within the Abyss, a shulsaga holy site on the Astral Plane called the Ring of Candles, and a moon on the Material Plane that features mercury seas. Within recent centuries, the very similar, chain-linked black towers known as the Ashstaves were erected here. Known as the Shackled Tower and the Cage of Tomes, these spires now serve as the home of the Order of the Gate's eldest member, Sheel Leroung, who advises his successors still.  The Isle of Seven Chains has become a secret shared by the vicarius of the Order of the Gate and his most worthy lieutenants. From here, they seek to learn more of the multiverse and collect magical relics that might aid them in furthering their goals upon Golarion.

{"_id":"JU75JwQzh1iwTujk","name":"Maniac Hand [Cursed]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This dried and withered hand ends in a jagged stump. When it is touched against the arm stump of a humanoid who has lost a hand, the maniac hand bonds instantly and returns to a lifelike appearance. It shrinks or grows to match the size of its new owner, and transforms itself to match the hand lost, becoming either a right or left hand. After merging, an uneven scar and unhealthy hue identify it as alien to its new owner.  Attacks made with a maniac hand receive a +2 competence bonus on attack and damage rolls. In addition, when making a full attack, the wielder can accept a -2 penalty to AC in order to make one extra attack with the hand using the wielder's full base attack bonus. This benefit is not cumulative with similar effects, such as a haste spell. For the purposes of these bonuses, any weapon held in the maniac hand o r in both hands qualifies, and the hand itself can deal damage as a slam attack appropriate to the wielder's size (1d4 for a Medium creature).  A maniac hand has an insidious will that slowly usurps control from the owner. It has Intelligence 8, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 10. Incapable of communication and bereft of rational thought, a maniac hand knows only an insatiable urge to destroy. When first attached, a maniac hand has an Ego score of 5. At least once each day, when presented with an opportunity to murder a friend or innocent without being witnessed, the maniac hand attempts to assert control using the rules for items against characters (Core Rulebook 535). If it succeeds, the hand takes control of its owner until it can  commit the murder or 5 minutes pass, whichever comes first. The owner remembers nothing of the crime save a blinding rage, and the hand's Ego score returns to 5. If the hand fails to assert control, the owner feels a momentary surge of anger, but can't identify the source. Each day that passes without the hand's murderous impulse killing a creature of Intelligence 3 or higher, its Ego score increases by 1. If its Ego score increases above 20, the hand no longer cares for caution, and attempts murder regardless of the chance of getting caught.  A maniac hand that's denied the death of friends or innocents for more than 30 days turns against its owner. If in a position to sabotage the owner, such as by letting go of a rope, it attempts to assert control. It can assert control while the owner sleeps, strangling its host or seizing a weapon to deliver a coup de grace. The hand attempts such an act at most once per day. An owner willing to slaughter innocents can keep the hand satisfied by finding an innocent victim and voluntarily relinquishing control to the hand.  If the owner tries to rid herself of the maniac hand by destroying or amputating it, the hand resists to the best of its ability. It makes attacks and one-handed grapple attempts with its owner's own Strength and Dexterity scores, augmented by the hand's bonuses. The hand has an AC equal to its owner's touch AC, except with a +4 size bonus that stacks with its owner's size modifier. Its owner loses her Dexterity bonus against the hand's attacks, but the hand retains its Dexterity bonus against its owner. The hand's hp is equal to 1/4 that of its owner.  Successfully casting remove curse on a maniac hand prevents it from resisting amputation for 1 hour.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Occult Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Maniac Hand","cl":13,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"necromancy"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"maniacHandCursed","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"hands","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264795,"modifiedTime":1677435299231,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Closer inspection reveals it's actually a humanoid heart-frozen hard, solid, and covered in smooth ice. When clenched in a fist, it feels like it throbs, though the organ remains unmoving and unyielding to the eye. It's said to once have been the heart of a gelugon, and before that it was the heart of a human being. Staring at it causes the surface to gloss over with darkened ice and makes the observer's eyes swim. Once the holder knows to study it, the heart functions as a crystal ball with telepathy.   The heart has a more sinister secret ability. With practice, mythic creatures can use the heart to scry more than just individuals, but entire settlements and cities. As the owner does, her mind becomes flooded with information about the region. Initially this knowledge consists of facts about population size, local economy, agriculture, leaders, and popular deities worshiped in the area.   The owner feels a powerful desire to continue watching, and if she does so while taking no other breaks except to eat and sleep, the information continues unabated. Over the course of 1d10 days, the heart reveals much more: the subtle social, religious, and economic influences of the settlement; the strengths and weaknesses of its leaders; and all the many secrets both pedestrian and profane that could be used to manipulate and extort those with power over the location. At this point, the heart begins to communicate to its new owner, suggesting courses of action that would bring her a higher social station, wealth, and power in that area. The heart's advice is almost always sound, but also always driven toward an unfortunate and evil outcome for someone-just not necessarily its owner. If the owner refuses to heed its advice, eventually the heart vanishes, seeking a more pliant puppet to manipulate.   Legends suggest that those who never question the heart's orders or decline its gift of knowledge eventually disappear to whatever cold place from which the heart originated.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Mythic Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Frozen Heart Of Cocytus","cl":15,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"divination"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"frozenHeartOfCocytusArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264797,"modifiedTime":1677435299231,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The runewell itself is a core part of the Rise of the Runelords Adventure Path, but by the time the PCs arrive at the Eye of Avarice, the circular well (which appears to be filled with molten gold) has already done its job absorbing fragments of greedy souls and is in the process of using that energy to finalize Karzoug's escape.  Beyond this effect, though, Karzoug can utilize the runewell in other ways. It grants him the ability to use scrying at will, although the runewell's range is limited to the Xin-Shalast region or to specific agents like Mokmurian, Xanesha, and Lucrecia. Creatures that wear magic items marked with the Sihedron take a -4 penalty on saves against this effect. The runewell allows Karzoug to see through the eyes and speak through the mouths of anyone who wears a Sihedron medallion (see p age 426). H e can also, given time, call up from the runewell a live adult blue dragon minion to serve him as an ally or mount. This essentially functions as a gate spell, save that the dragon is actually created by the runewell rather than called. Karzoug can only have one such dragon in existence at any one time, and must wait 8 hours after a previous dragon's death before calling a new blue dragon to serve him.  The runewell itself is 10 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep. The liquid it contains functions in all ways as molten gold-dealing damage is if it were lava upon creatures splashed or immersed within it. Gold drawn from the runewell cools normally and is permanent-the runewell immediately replenishes gold taken from its supplies-yet this gold cannot exist more than 30 feet from the runewell's rim. If brought beyond this range, it vanishes in an instant.  Runewells associated with other runelords and sins exist throughout the ruins of Thassilon; each of these artifacts is a unique item with its own powers.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>RotRL-AE-Appendix","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":900},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Runewell Of Greed","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"necromancy"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"runewellOfGreedArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264802,"modifiedTime":1677435299236,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

{"_id":"LkPxyvjYYioLtxJa","name":"Book Of The Damned (daemonic) [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The daemonic chapters of the Book of the Damned are bound between covers of perpetually frozen, compressed ashes that seem to suck ambient light into their material. The pages appear to be a palimpsest, with the words written over the intentionally erased words of an earlier draft, though it is unknown who redacted it and when this redaction occurred. In each case, the edited portions describe specific events related to the earliest history of the plane of Abaddon, sometimes with entire pages being censored. Scholars suspect this is akin to the magic the Horsemen use to scour their own records and history in cycles when one of the Four has been replaced.  A good-aligned creature that touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains 1 negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from this section of the book for 24 hours. A creature that is not neutral evil and attempts to read this section of the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have his alignment permanently shift one step toward neutral evil.  The text is written in a mixture of Abyssal and Infernal, sometimes changing from one to the other midsentence, so readers must be fluent in both languages to fully understand the  nuances and true meaning of the text. As a reader proceeds, he becomes aware of a dull pressure on the back of his skull and a buzzing static. Eventually the text begins to speak to him, conveying telepathic impressions and images to complement the text. A telepathic creature can read the text without actually opening this volume merely by holding it and concentrating.  This portion of the Book of the Damned contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as awaken the devoured, Charon's dispensation, sacrifice, and soul transfer (see pages 183, 185, and 186). The user gains a +4 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks when using this portion as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of Abaddon are so accurate that any teleportation to or within that plane always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). Spells cast by the bearer that inflict negative levels inflict 1 additional negative level on affected targets.  The daemonic portion of the Book of the Damned serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy attuned to attract neutral evil creatures. As long as the book's owner is carrying it, he casts all evil spells as if he were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with neutral evil creatures (these bonuses are considered to be profane bonuses and do not stack with similar bonuses granted by other partial Books of the Damned). Three times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, circle of death, death knell, energy drain, soul bind, or soul transfer (see page 186). It is believed that the bearer can be subject to scrying at any time, without a saving throw, by the Four Horsemen or their elite agents.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Book of the Damned","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":12},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Book Of The Damned (daemonic)","cl":25,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"all schools [evil lawful]"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"bookOfTheDamnedDaemonicArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264810,"modifiedTime":1677435299237,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The final blades were originally designed to provide a condemned prisoner a swift and painless death, but also to prevent the resurrection of said victim by trapping her soul within the guillotine's blade upon execution.  Every blade has a unique appearance and citizens speak of them as if they are people. In speaking of a condemned prisoner, someone might say, He'll lie with Bloody Jaine before the sun falls. Only Large or smaller helpless (or willing) creatures can be executed by a final blade. When a final blade scythes down to decapitate the target, treat this as a coup de grace attempt on the victim that inflicts 6d6+12 points of damage. A final blade's damage penetrates all damage reduction (save epic damage reduction) and negates all regeneration effects. A creature slain by this effect is immediately targeted by a soul bind effect that automatically places her soul into the blade itself (no save).  A final blade has no limit to the number of souls it can hold.  It is possible to release a soul from a final blade to allow that creature to be resurrected, but the ritual involved is a closely guarded secret known only to the Gray Gardeners.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Inner Sea World Guide","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1000},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Final Blade","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"strong,"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"finalBladeArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264813,"modifiedTime":1677435299238,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The true origins of this artifact have been lost over time. The cauldron of blood allows the user to view past or future events (similar to a divination or legend lore spell) by donating blood from his body to the boiling waters of the cauldron. To use this device, the user must bring water in the cauldron to a boil, and then bleed himself; allowing his fresh blood to drip into the boiling water. (This deals normal damage and temporary Constitution damage to the user based on how far in the past or future he wishes to look.) At this time, the user decides whether to view past or future events. The events can concern a person, place, or thing; they can be current or forgotten, or even information that is not yet known (see the divination spell). The cauldron functions for a maximum of 10 minutes before the visions disappear. Viewable Time Damage* Future/Past Fee** 2 30 minutes/6 months 50 gp 4 1 hour/1 year 100 gp 6 12 hours/20 years 500 gp 8 1 day/50 years 2000 gp 12 1 week/100 years 5000 gp in magic items 16 1 month/300 years 10,000 gp in magic items 20 1 year/500 years 20,000 gp in magic items *Damage is applied to both current hit points and Constitution. Both heal at the normal rate. Note that a user cannot bring his Constitution below 1 using the cauldron. The damage lost also represents the effective caster level of the cauldron to penetrate any magical wards against such scrying. **This base price excludes the blood/Con loss required to fuel the cauldron; the value listed is suggested as a starting point for bargaining. They go as low as 75% of this value if the negotiation is sufficiently skillful. Alternately, they may require in lieu of this fee that the PC fetch them a particular item, such as a lock of hair from a king's daughter, an enchanted lyre in the keeping of an ogre mage, or the skull of the Oracle of Rappan Athuk (see Level 3, Area 3-7).<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Rappan Athuk","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":100},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Cauldron Of Blood","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"divination"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"cauldronOfBloodArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264814,"modifiedTime":1677435299238,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The pages pertaining to the good Outer Planes lie within covers of beaten precious metals, bedecked with jewels of every color and inscribed with celestial iconography. Only a truly reverent individual, completely devoted to good, can open the Chronicle of the Righteous without an effort of will; for others, a successful DC 12 Will save is required to open the book. On a failed save, the individual decides she is unworthy of beholding the Chronicle and cannot attempt to open the book again for 24 hours.   The Chronicle of the Righteous is written in Celestial. It details the geography of the good-aligned planes, the gods, empyreal lords, and celestial creatures who live there, and the unadulterated truths of these beings and their acts-truths that are sometimes heartening and at other times unsettling. Any evil-aligned creature who touches the Chronicle of the Righteous gains 1 negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Nongood creatures attempting to read the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward good.   A reader who spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) studying the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every conjuration (healing) spell and every spell with the good descriptor. The user gains a +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks if she uses the book as a resource (consulting it for at least 1 hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of the good-aligned planes are so accurate that any teleportation travel to or within those planes always brings the caster to the exact location desired.   As long as the book is carried, the user is immediately aware of any action that might cause an alignment shift or a loss of standing with her deity, as if she wore a phylactery of faithfulness. The Chronicle of the Righteous is also surrounded by a permanent zone of truth, and creatures must succeed at a DC 15 Will save to tell a lie within 20 feet of the book. The bearer of the book casts all good spells as if she were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks when interacting with good creatures. Three times per day, the book can be used to cast one of the following spells: banishment, consecrate, greater planar binding, holy smite, holy word, sanctify weapons, and summon monster VII. Each time the Chronicle of the Righteous is referenced or used to cast a spell, there is a 10% chance that any empyreal lords on the same plane as the user instantly become aware of the book's precise location.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Chronicle Of The Righteous","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":12},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Chronicle Of The Righteous","cl":25,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"all schools [good]"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"chronicleOfTheRighteousArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264815,"modifiedTime":1677435299238,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Unlike a normal staff, a staff of eldritch sovereignty holds 50 charges and can't be recharged normally. Some of its powers use charges, and others don't. A staff of eldritch sovereignty doesn't lose its powers if it runs out of charges. The following powers don't use charges:   • Arcane lock  • Arcane sight  • Daylight  • Knock  • Mage armor  • Mage hand  • Touch of idiocy  The following powers drain 1 charge per use:  • Black tentacles  • Cone of cold (15d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half)  • Fireball (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 18 half)  • Greater dispel magic  • Greater invisibility  • Greater teleport  • Lightning arcUM (15d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half)  • Major image (Will DC 18 disbelief)  • Suggestion (Will DC 18 negates)  These powers drain 2 charges per use:  • Summon monster IX (the summoned creatures receive the benefits of the Augment Summoning feat)  • Plane shift (Will DC 22 negates, arrive 2 to 200 miles from the intended destination)  • Prismatic sphere (DC 24)  • Prismatic spray (DC 22)  For 5 charges, the staff of arcane sovereignty creates a gate.  The staff of eldritch sovereignty has higher DCs than normal for a staff. The wielder still uses her own save DCs if they exceed those of the staff.  The wielder can use any of her metamagic feats on spells cast with the staff of eldritch sovereignty by expending 1 charge per increase in spell level, with a minimum of 1 charge spent. The adjusted level of the spell can't be increased above 9th level. For example, a user with Quicken Spell can spend 5 charges to cast a quickened cone of cold with the staff, but couldn't use it to cast quickened greater teleport.  The wielder can expend one use of mythic power to gain the benefit of a number of charges equal to her mythic tier. Any excess charges are lost. For example, a 5th-tier wielder with Empower Spell could expend one use of mythic power to cast an empowered fireball without consuming any charges from the staff. A wielder who knows the mythic version of one of the staff's spells can cast such spells from the staff by expending one use of mythic power. This can be combined with using mythic power to provide charges. Finally, the wielder can expend one use of mythic power to add 1 charge to the staff, with no risk of explosion if the staff is already fully charged.  A staff of eldritch sovereignty gives the wielder spell resistance equal to 23 plus her tier. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can be used to absorb arcane energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough energy to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if the wielder had performed a retributive strike (see Destruction). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her—the staff doesn’t communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. Thus, absorbing spells can be risky. <br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Mythic Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":5},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Staff Of Eldritch Sovereignty","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"varied"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"staffOfEldritchSovereigntyArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264823,"modifiedTime":1677435299239,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

When the life lantern sheds darkness in the hand of an undead creature, all undead creatures in that area of darkness gain fast healing 5.

Any creature of or near deity-level power (including archdevils, demon lords, empyreal lords, Horsemen, and similar beings) wounded by the Ihystear must succeed at a DC 35 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round.  Aside from its use as a weapon, the fragment holds within it the final scream of Ihys-the cry of the first murder and of the first slain deity. As a full-round action, a creature bearing the Ihystear that succeeds at a DC 30 Strength check can snap the weapon in half. Doing so releases an echo of this scream: a terrible, deafening shriek that pierces the world and can be heard for dozens of miles. Any creature within 100 feet of the broken Ihystear-including the wielder-must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be slain instantly. Those who succeed at their saves are rendered deaf and insane (as per the spells blindness/deafness and insanity). This scream continues for 3 rounds and pierces even magical silence. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect. At the end of this time, the Ihystear heals itself and returns to normal. However, there is a 50% chance each time it is broken that it randomly shifts to another plane.  For long centuries, Asmodeus held the Ihystear within the Catafalque, deep in Nessus, though in recent years rumors claim sightings of the weapon on Golarion.

The dark grimoire is a substantial text, nearly 1,000 pages long. Its pages contain some good spells and some evil spells, though most aren't tied to any alignment. It also contains an account of many of the beings of the Elder Mythos and spells intended for summoning them.  The very act of reading the text is dangerous. Every hour a reader studies the book, there is a 2% chance that the reader encounters something too much for mortal minds to absorb and goes insane (as per insanity). A successful DC 25 Will save negates the insanity, but each time a creature succeeds at this save, the DC of the next Will save against insanity from the dark grimoire increases by 5, and these increases stack. Unlike normal for the insanity spell, only a wish or miracle can reverse the insanity inflicted by the dark grimoire.  Using the dark grimoire to cast spells requires no spellcasting ability-merely time. Casting any spell requires studying the book for a number of hours equal to the spell's level (or 30 minutes for a 0-level spell). Any spell that normally involves a costly material component instead requires sacrificing humanoid creatures. Any spell that normally requires a costly focus instead requires a focus  built from the remains of sacrificed humanoid creatures. In both cases, 1 Hit Die worth of sacrifices are required for each 25 gp that the component or focus normally costs.  Summoning an entity of the Elder Mythos requires studying the book for a number of hours equal to double the creature's CR and making a number of humanoid sacrifices equal to double the creature's Hit Dice. If an attempt to summon a Great Old One is made in this manner, there is only a 25% chance that it appears. If the Great Old One appears, there is an equal chance that it attacks, ignores, or communicates with the creature that summoned it.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Horror Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":6},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Dark Grimoire","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"all schools"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"darkGrimoireArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264835,"modifiedTime":1677435299240,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

{"_id":"OIqaj4pBSNRiMFVC","name":"Thrushmoor Star Stelae [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The Star Stelae in Thrushmoor are partially operational and provide the following benefits to any creature bearing an unholy symbol of Hastur-the Yellow Sign. Each Star Stela has a number of charges that can be replenished with an appropriate sacrifice, and activating one of the artifact's effects expends a number of charges. Each stone can hold a maximum of 50 charges. Because these artifacts are damaged and not operating at their full potential, their auras register as faint instead of strong or overwhelming.  If a creature in possession of a Yellow Sign touches a Star Stela, it immediately receives a flow of telepathic impressions that it can attempt to interpret with a DC 25 Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (religion) check. If the creature succeeds, it understands what the Star Stela can do, and can attempt to tap into their power.  Any creature using a Star Stela for any of these effects is bombarded with strange images and distant whispers. If the  creature makes use of the teleportation effect, it steps into one wall and emerges into what looks like an abandoned and eerily quiet city filled with swirling yellow mist before exiting to its desired location.  A creature bearing the unholy symbol of Hastur can make use of the following effects.  City Stride: By touching one of the Star Stelae, a user can create a temporary portal on a wall within 200 feet of the stone. The user can then travel to another wall within 200 feet of one of the other two Star Stelae as if via dimension door. A sooty mural of a gloomy and abandoned city appears on any wall used for this manner of travel. This use expends 2 charges.  Sinister Whispers: By touching one of Thrushmoor's Star Stelae, a user can transmit a short, whispered message to any point within 300 feet of any of the three artifacts. All creatures wearing an unholy symbol of Hastur within that area hear the whispered message and can give a short reply. This use expends 1 charge. If the user and another creature are touching different stones at the same time, one of them can expend 2 charges to communicate telepathically for 1 minute.  If a stone is depleted of all its charges, it becomes inactive and can't be used anymore. An inactive Star Stela can be activated again only through the successful completion of a specific occult ritual (the same one that Melisenn used to originally awaken the stones).  Charges can be replenished through sacrifice. If a sentient living creature is killed in the name of Hastur while in contact with one of the Star Stelae, the artifact gains a number of charges equal to 1 per Hit Die of the sacrificed victim.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 110","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":44000},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Thrushmoor Star Stelae","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration and transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"thrushmoorStarStelaeArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264837,"modifiedTime":1677435299240,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

It is similar to a mirror of opposition or mirror of life trapping, but it lacks a command word. A mirror of soul snaring has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must succeed at a DC 23 Will save or have its soul sucked into one of the compartments. A creature not aware of the cursed nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection and thus needing to attempt the saving throw drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror is cursed and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).  When a creature's soul is trapped, its body remains outside of the mirror. The body becomes possessed by a malignant spirit who behaves in a way entirely opposed to how the trapped creature would. Treat this spirit as the creature, with  a reversed alignment (and potentially other factors reversed, such as being an antipaladin instead of a paladin). In the case of neutral characters, the spirit can be either chaotic evil or lawful good as decided by the GM. The death of the creature's original body does not free its soul from the mirror, though if it is ever set free, it immediately passes on to the afterlife as it no longer has a body to inhabit.  If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim's soul (determined randomly) is set free and immediately reconnects with its duplicate body if available. If the mirror is destroyed (hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped in it are freed. Unless the mirror is destroyed, not even a miracle or wish can restore the trapped creature's spirit to its body.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Occult Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":45},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Mirror Of Soul Snaring","cl":15,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"necromancy"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"mirrorOfSoulSnaringCursed","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264839,"modifiedTime":1677435299240,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Ydersius's clerics still receive spells from their prayers, granted by the skull regardless of its location or ownership. There is no way a mortal can block this effect. Possession of the skull grants several abilities.  Blessing of Scales: All reptilian creatures (including worshipers of Ydersius, sorcerers with the serpentine or draconic bloodline, and druids wild-shaped into reptilian forms) within 160 feet of the Skull of Ydersius gain spell resistance 25 and fast healing 10.  Unholy Aura: The skull treats the 80-foot-radius area around it as though an unhallow spell had been cast with the Skull of Ydersius as the point of origin. This effect carries with it two linked spells that affect only worshipers of Ydersius (death ward and freedom of movement), and two linked spells that affect all non-worshipers of Ydersius (bane and dimensional anchor).  Voice of the Serpent: Once per day, a creature that touches the skull may cast commune to speak with Ydersius. A non-worshiper of Ydersius who uses this power must make a successful DC 25 Will save each time the power is used to avoid succumbing to a feeblemind spell.  Any good-aligned creature that carries the Skull of Ydersius, even via an extradimensional space such as a portable hole, gains three negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the skull is carried and disappear when the skull is released. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the skull is carried.

While bearing Vesper's Rapier, the wielder gains a +4 bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks made to influence humanoids, and can use the rapier like a compass to point in the direction of the closest collection of gems, silver, or drinkable water as a standard action at will.  The sword also grants the wielder the ability to either slip or tighten the bonds of the physical world, granting her the ability to cast dimension door, dimensional lock, or greater teleport. These powers have limits, though, as they can drain the sword's magical abilities for the day-dimensional lock and greater teleport can be used once per day and drain the sword immediately after their use; dimension door can be used at will, but drains the sword after 3 uses, though the wielder can continue to use dimension door even if the sword is drained (this is the only effect that functions even when the sword is drained). If the sword becomes drained, it loses all of its magical properties (aside from dimension door), including its +3 enhancement bonus, skill bonuses, and the keen and speed special abilities. All of these properties are restored every day at midnight.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +3 keen speed sword</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Artifacts and Legends","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Vesper's Rapier","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"vespersRapierArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264851,"modifiedTime":1677435299241,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
{"_id":"PpNxYoau0G3QXwYK","name":"Scepter Of The Shining Lord [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Fashioned from a single piece of black jade, this 3-foot-long scepter has a T-shaped handle carved to resemble the head of a horned crocodile. The scepter's other end curls and forms an eyehook, to which is tied a leather strap. Strung along this strap are four small, copper bells. Each bell signifies a single concept related to rulership: authority, banishment, dominion, and imprisonment.  An individual seeking to wield the scepter must first bond with the artifact by permanently offering it one use of her mythic power. Thereafter, the owner must always keep one use of power unspent to maintain the bond. If the owner expends all her mythic power, the bond breaks and the individual can no longer access any of the scepter's power until she reestablishes her bond of ownership.  Once bonded, the scepter can be wielded as a +6 brilliant energy light mace that grants a +4 enhancement bonus to its bonded owner's Charisma score. In addition, the owner can expend one use of mythic power and ring the scepter's bells to produce the following effects:  • The wielder can ring the bell of authority to cast command targeting any non-mythic creature.  • The wielder can ring the bell of banishment to cast dismissal upon any non-mythic outsider with a CR at least 3 less than the wielder's total class level plus her tier.  • The wielder can ring the bell of dominion to cast sanctuary on any non-mythic creature.  • The wielder can ring the bell of imprisonment to cast forcecage on any non-mythic creature with a CR at least 3 less than the wielder's total class level plus her tier.  The caster level for all four effects is equal to the owner's total character level plus her tier. When she rings a bell, she can also expend an additional use of mythic power to increase the DC of the spell-like ability's saving throw by 10.  Lastly, the owner can use the scepter to appoint a mythic agent to be a protector and advocate of the owner's people. When she does so, she bestows 1d4 uses of mythic power upon that creature that last for 1 month if the creature is mythic, or until they are spent if the creature is non-mythic. If the agent is mythic, these points increase the agent's maximum number of mythic uses for the month. If the champion is non-mythic, as long as that agent retains at least one use of mythic power, it gains the hard to kill and surge base mythic abilities (see page 12).<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +6 brilliant energy light mace</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Mythic Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":4},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Scepter Of The Shining Lord","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"abjuration and enchantment"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"scepterOfTheShiningLordArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264853,"modifiedTime":1677435299242,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The Icecrown of Irrisen is the royal regalia of the queen of Irrisen, was crafted by Baba Yaga specifically for that role, and has been worn by all of Baba Yaga's daughters who have served as monarchs of that realm. When placed on the head, the Icecrown merges with the wearer so that icicles seem to grow directly from her head. Once in place, the crown can be removed only by Baba Yaga or upon the death of the wearer or the destruction of the crown. The Icecrown of Irrisen deals 3d6 points of cold damage per round to any creature touching or wearing it as it absorbs body heat (or 6d6 points of cold damage per round to a creature with the fire subtype).   The Icecrown of Irrisen grants its wearer the following abilities: fire resistance 20, spell resistance 32, and a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence and Charisma (with ranks in Knowledge [local] and Sense Motive, as a headband of vast intelligence). The wearer doesn't take penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution from being of middle age or older (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169), and retains a youthful appearance, always appearing to be the same age as when she first put on the crown. Once per day, the wearer can summon three elder ice elementals that remain for 1 hour and follow her commands. In addition, the Icecrown gives its wearer the following abilities:   Constant-tongues   At will-frigid touchUM, ice crystal teleportUM, Irriseni mirror sight*, unseen servant   3/day-control weather, dominate monster (creatures with the cold subtype only), ice spears*   1/day-overwhelming presenceUM, polar midnightUM   Finally, the Icecrown of Irrisen gives its wearer the ability to shape the ice that forms the Royal Palace in Whitethrone, allowing her to create or destroy walls, doors, windows, and even furnishings and decorations at will.   * See Pathfinder Adventure Path #67 72-73.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 72","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":3},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Icecrown Of Irrisen","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"icecrownOfIrrisenArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"head","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264854,"modifiedTime":1677435299242,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Its dry, yellowed parchment leaves bear profane symbols and diagrams, prayers to archdevils, descriptions of Hell and its torments, explanations of foul rites, heresies and libel profane to every god, vituperation against countless deities, explorations of diabolical life, and pages of evil magic supposedly expunged from the world long ago.  A good-aligned creature that so much as touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains 1 negative level. This level can't be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from this section of the book for 24 hours. A creature that is not lawful evil and attempts to read this section of the book must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have his alignment permanently shift one step toward lawful evil.  Those who dare read this section of the Book of the Damned find that it holds a wealth of profane knowledge. Any character who can read Infernal and spends a total of 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) studying the folio uncovers numerous foul revelations and gains a number of benefits. Readers find that the tome holds copies of every spell with the evil spell descriptor, as well as create drug and sacrifice (see pages 183 and 185). A significant portion of this volume contains lists of fiendish true names hidden in complex metaphors and codes, allowing someone who has access to only this portion of the Book of the Damned to perform the manifest manifestation ritual (see page 193), but at a penalty of -4 to the skill checks involved due to the incomplete nature of these lists. The descriptions of Hell found within prove so detailed that any magical attempt to teleport to or within the infernal plane (such as by use of plane shift or teleport) takes the bearer to the exact intended destination with no familiarity roll needed.  Beyond its contents, this section of the Book of the Damned is itself a potent unholy magic item. At its most basic level, the tome serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy tuned to attract lawful evil creatures. Also, any greater devil using scry or a similar spell can view the diabolic Book of the Damned with no risk of being detected by the bearer.  Those in possession of these pages also gain a number of benefits. The bearer casts evil spells as if he were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with lawful evil creatures (these bonuses are considered to be profane bonuses and do not stack with similar bonuses granted by other parts of the Book of the Damned). Three times per day, the tome can be invoked to cast one of the following spells: desecrate, dictum, gate (to summon a hellmouth to Hell only), greater planar binding, hellfire ray, summon monster VII, and unholy blight. Once per day, the bearer can ask the folio a question related to Hell, lawful evil creatures, or any other profane topic; he then opens the book to a random page to find the answer, revealed as if he had cast vision.  Every time one of the artifact's daily spells or its vision power is used, there is a cumulative 1% chance that a powerful devil takes note of the bearer and seeks to make use of him in some profane plot or simply claims his soul for Hell.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Book of the Damned","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":12},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Book Of The Damned (diabolic)","cl":25,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"all schools [evil lawful]"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"bookOfTheDamnedDiabolicArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264857,"modifiedTime":1677435299242,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

There are only a limited number of Elder Signs in existence, so each time one of these artifacts is destroyed, the universe loses one of the few things that can reliably keep cosmic horrors at bay-and inevitable doom draws closer.  A creature holding an Elder Sign can cast banishment, forbiddance, and greater dispel magic at will by reciting occult mantras, though all three effects work only against creatures and magic related to the Elder Mythos, including any of the following creatures (and other cosmic horror-related creatures, at the GM's discretion): bholeB4, colour out of spaceB4, deep oneB5, deep one elderB5, denizen of LengB2, elder thingB4, flying polypB4, gugB2, hound of TindalosB2, Leng ghoulB5, Leng spiderB2, mi-goB4, nightgauntB4, ratlingB4, shantakB2, shoggoth, spawn of Yog-SothothB4, star-spawn of CthulhuB4, voonithB3, wendigoB2, and yithianB3. Casting forbiddance this way doesn't require a costly material component, but if the same Elder Sign is used to cast forbiddance again, the artifact's connection to a previous location warded by the spell is severed, ending the first spell's effects immediately. Casting banishment on one of the listed creatures works even if the creature isn't extraplanar; in that case, it sends the creature to the place on the Material Plane from which it originated.

When first given to a creature, the necklace recognizes members of the creature's race and gender-but not a specific individual- as its owner. The owner automatically fails any saving throw made to resist the effects of divination magic, but the necklace seeks to protect the owner against danger, reactively casting spells to defend its wearer against effects that compromise her control. The spells the amulet can cast (and when it does so) include freedom (in response to imprisonment, petrification, paralysis, and similar effects described by this spell), greater dispel magic (in response to any fear or mind-affecting effect), remove curse (in response to curses), protection from chaos (in response to any form of possession or similar control). The wearer has no control over when these spells are cast and the target of these spells is always the wearer. The Invidian Eye can cast each spell 3 times per day.  If the Invidian Eye is worn by a creature not of the race and gender it recognizes as its owner, it ceases to use its defensive properties. In addition, once every 1d6 days, the gem makes a self-destructive suggestion. The wearer must succeed at a DC 20 Will saving throw or make a casual attempt to harm herself during the course of the day. This suggestion does not dominate the wearer's actions, but she might be compelled to cut herself if she's wielding a weapon or jump if she passes a high window. If the wearer resists this compulsion three times in a row, the Invidian Eye takes more serious measures, conjuring a miniature prismatic sphere into the wearer's throat, which causes the wearer to begin suffocating (Core Rulebook 445). The sphere can only be removed by targeting the wearer with the same spells that normally remove a full size prismatic wall.  The race and gender the Invidian Eye perceives as its owner can be reset by casting mage's disjunction upon the artifact, though this carries the normal risk of destroying the artifact. Whoever the necklace is next given to determines the artifact's new owner.  The Invidian Eye is under the effects of a permanent nondetection spell.

By sweeping the broom in a circular motion, the user can also learn the location of both secret doors and simple natural traps at will, as detect secret doors and detect snares and pits.  Baba Yaga's besom can also be used up to three times per day to open locks, doors, lids, shackles, chains, and the like by knocking it against the item to be opened. The wielder must succeed at a caster level check using the broom's caster level of 20th, with a DC equal to the Disable Device DC of the lock or binding. Each knock opens only one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, locked, and under an arcane lock, it takes all three uses of the broom to open it.

Knem Koth was betrayed by the Phoromycean deities, Kringa the Temptress and the enigmatic blind god known only as The Master. They tricked Knem Koth into becoming stuck in the Lair of Lacrymundus and then murdered him with the help of that eldritch dragon. They dismembered him and scattered his pieces across the multiverse, though his malevolent will seems to have been retained in them as many are still potent artifacts. Ironically, though Kringa and The Master have long since disappeared from the divine realms and been forgotten, the shadow giants have diligently searched for more than 10,000 years for all of the pieces of their lost deity in order to one day reassemble and resurrect this wicked force of darkness.  The hand has various powers of chaos and evil. It appears as a coal-black, six-fingered hand of Large size. The stump of the hand is encased in a platinum cuff that is in turn affixed to a platinum chain. When someone bears the Hand, they gain the following powers:  At will-dimensional anchor (see below), gate mastery (see below)  3/day-hold person  1/day-hold monster  Modified dimensional anchor: Anyone attempting to gate, teleport, dimension door or use some other means of magical conveyance within 200 feet of the bearer of the Hand of Knem Koth must make a DC 20 Will save or be unable to depart the presence of the bearer without his permission.  Gate Mastery: The bearer can inscribe the mark of Knem Koth upon any permanent magical gate, which allows the bearer to control who passes between the planes that the gate connects. The mark remains until dispelled by the bearer of the hand or until a new owner takes possession of the hand.  The Hand of Knem Koth is fully evil and takes possession of weak souls, who are required to make a DC 25 Will save to avoid its evil effects each time a power is used. Creatures possessed by the Hand of Knem Koth are geased to quest for the other pieces of the dead god and stop at nothing to accomplish this quest.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Sword of Air","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":25},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Hand Of Knem Koth","cl":16,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"handOfKnemKothArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264869,"modifiedTime":1677435299243,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

During the time of Azlant, dozens of flamma horacalcums existed, each of which had to be encased in an orrery-like container made of horacalcum to prevent the flame from burning away into another time. The flame itself is weightless, but the orrery that contains it weighs 7 pounds, and requires a free hand to carry and utilize.  As a free action, a flamma horacalcum's level of illumination can be adjusted by its carrier's thought to range from the brightness of a single candle to that shed by a daylight spell. This light is considered to be from a 9th-level spell for the purposes of overcoming magical darkness. Once the flamma horacalcum is set down, it continues to radiate its last level of light.  This light bends and warps time in slight ways for its carrier, granting her a +4 bonus on all initiative checks. Three times per day, the flame can be commanded to cast a haste spell as a swift action. The carrier can also use the flame as a standard action to unleash a thin beam of fire equivalent to a searing light. A creature hit by this effect is slowed, as per the spell, for 1d4 rounds if it fails at a DC 20 Will save.  Once per week as a standard action, the user of a flamma horacalcum can blow the flame out, snuffing it entirely. This triggers a time stop effect on the user that lasts for 1d4 rounds, after which the flame reignites. Other observers see this effect only as a brief flickering of the flame, since the duration of the time the flame was extinguished is contained wholly by the time stop effect.

When the earth's eye is worn on a headband and positioned in the center of the forehead, it creates a mental bond between the wearer and all natural, unworked stone within 200 feet. By concentrating, the wearer can alter this stone in the following ways. These changes are permanent but are too gradual to damage most creatures and objects.  Calcific Alterations: The wearer pulls mineral-rich moisture through the stone to create stalactites, stalagmites, and similar rock formations. These formations are the same type of stone as the surrounding area, and they appear to be seamless, natural growths. This change requires 1 full round of concentration for each 5-foot square affected.  Create Habitat: The wearer draws forth a natural spring or pool of clear water, causes edible molds or fungi to sprout, or opens narrow vents that bring in fresh air from elsewhere. This change requires 1 full round of concentration for each 5-foot square affected.  Crystalline Forms: The wearer transforms stone into translucent crystal. Sighted creatures can see through up to 30 feet of translucent crystal; thicker crystal is too cloudy to see through. The wearer can also transform nonmagical crystal into ordinary stone. This change requires 1 minute of concentration for each 5-foot square affected.  Reduce Stone: The wearer can remove stone entirely, but the resulting open space appears natural. Anything previously supported by stone that was removed entirely-such as a cavern ceiling-collapses. This change requires 1 minute of concentration for each 5-foot square affected.  Stone Tell: The wearer can cause a 5-foot-square area of stone to ripple slightly, displaying momentary images of creatures and objects that have touched, used, or passed by the stone. This functions as stone tell but works only on natural stone. This requires 10 minutes of concentration.  The earth's eye does not function when in natural sunlight.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 120","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Earth's Eye","cl":18,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"earthsEyeArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"headband","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264879,"modifiedTime":1677435299244,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Once it infects a host, Plaguebringer renders h im immune to the e ffects o f any lesser disease. Despite this immunity, the host can still spread disease; indeed, his body becomes an incubator for the countless ailments of the mortal world. When exposed to a disease, the host automatically fails any saving throw to avoid contracting it, but suffers no ill effects. The host indefinitely remains an asymptomatic carrier for any diseases caught.  Plaguebringer also grants the following abilities:  • The host receives a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, caster level checks, and saving throws.  • The host generates an aura of unlife in a 30-foot radius. All living creatures other than the host within this radius take 2d6 points of negative energy damage each round. Undead creatures gain fast healing 5 that stacks with any fast healing they already possess. This aura can be suppressed or resumed as a standard action.  • As part of using an ability that requires him to expend mythic power, the host can target a mythic creature within 30 feet. If that creature fails a DC 23 Fortitude save, it contracts a random disease (as contagion) and one use of its mythic power is stolen and granted to the host. If the host fails to steal mythic power, he must expend double the usual amount of his own mythic power or the ability fails.  • The host can use contagion heightened to 8th level (DC 23) at will.  • The host can use empowered vampiric touch three times per day.  • As a swift action, the host can expend one use of mythic power to gain the effects of death ward, divine power, and spell resistance. These effects last 1 round per tier he possesses and can't be dispelled.  • Once per day, the host can expend two uses of mythic power to summon a nightwingB2 to do his bidding for 1 hour. If the nightwing is slain, a new one can't be summoned for 1 week.  Plaguebringer is intelligent, with an Intelligence score of 15, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 20. It has a neutral evil alignment, communicates by empathy, and has an Ego of 30. It exists only to spread disease and cause suffering. It protects and aids hosts that please it. If infecting a host who resists these goals, it withholds its abilities and attempts to control the host. Plaguebringer can take a single standard or swift action on its host's turn to activate any of its powers that don't require a touch attack. It has five uses of mythic power available to expend each day. It can use its host's own mythic power by becoming dominant (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 535).  When infecting a host, it has full access to its host's senses, along with darkvision and blindsense with a range of 120 feet. When not in a host, Plaguebringer has only limited awareness, with hearing and blindsense usable to a range of 30 feet and no vision. When not infecting a host, Plaguebringer is undetectable by normal vision due to its microscopic size, though detect evil reveals its presence. It can fly at a speed of 30 feet, and can infect a new host by entering its body. If the target fails a DC 30 Fortitude save, Plaguebringer infects it and the creature gains access to the artifact's powers. If the target succeeds, Plaguebringer can't attempt to infect it again for 1 month.  Plaguebringer can leave a host by becoming dominant and choosing to leave. Immediately after it leaves, the host is affected by multiple contagion effects (DC 30), one for each of the diseases listed in the spell.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Mythic Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Plaguebringer","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"necromancy"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"plaguebringerArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264883,"modifiedTime":1677435299245,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.   A sphere of annihilation is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a sphere of annihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Intelligence modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action.   Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30.   If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it. If two or more creatures vie for control of a sphere of annihilation, the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest.

{"_id":"SlkSdZssUMQicIXI","name":"Shinobi Fuhonsen [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The shinobi fuhonsen is said to have been the first payment ever made to a ninja in the history of Minkai. The tarnished bronze coin has a square central hole and bears six ideograms on its two faces-four on one face and two on the other, with two spaces apparently left blank. A leather thong is threaded through the coin's central hole, allowing the coin to be worn around the neck.  The six ideograms on the coin correspond to six different skills: Acrobatics, Climb, Disguise, Escape Artist, Perception, and Stealth. A DC 30 Knowledge (arcana) or DC 20 Linguistics check identifies the ideograms and their corresponding skills. The shinobi fuhonsen currently has six powers, each corresponding to one of the six ideograms and its associated skill. If a new owner has at least 8 ranks in another skill, the shinobi fuhonsen gains an additional power based on that skill, and a new ideogram emerges on the coin's surface. The new power and the skill it corresponds to are left up to the GM, though the power should be related to its skill, and the skill should be one on which the owner often relies. Although the existing powers of the shinobi fuhonsen are based on skills common to rogues and bards, new powers and their corresponding skills are not restricted to those of any one class. Only one new power may be unlocked per owner.  The coin's powers only function for a worthy owner, who must have at least 8 ranks in each of the six skills, plus 8 ranks in another skill. If the bearer of the coin is not a worthy owner (i.e., does not have enough skill ranks), the coin vanishes from the bearer's possession at the next new moon, reappearing elsewhere in Minkai to seek out a new owner.  When a new owner first takes possession of the shinobi fuhonsen and activates a new power, the new ideogram (and its associated power) appears on the coin on a temporary basis, and the owner receives a vision of the coin's previous owners at the time of their deaths. If the new owner is not chaotic evil, he must immediately make a DC 25 Will save or his alignment shifts one step toward chaotic evil. If the save succeeds, the owner resists the change and can use the coin's powers until the next new moon, when he must make another save. The owner must make a new Will save at every new moon until his alignment becomes chaotic evil, or until the artifact is no longer in his possession.  As long as the owner is not chaotic evil, he can simply discard the shinobi fuhonsen, at which point the coin vanishes at the next new moon. Once the owner becomes chaotic evil, the new ideogram (and its associated power) becomes permanent and he can no longer discard the coin, as if it were a cursed item.  Each of the coin's powers can be activated by speaking the name of the corresponding ideogram, unless otherwise noted. The known powers (and their associated skills) of the shinobi fuhonsen are as follows.  • Power #1 (Acrobatics): The owner can cast shadow walk once per day.  • Power #2 (Climb): The owner can cast spider climb three times per day.  • Power #3 (Disguise): The owner is permanently under the effects of misdirection.  • Power #4 (Escape Artist): The owner can cast dimension door three times per day.  • Power #5 (Perception): The owner can cast scrying once per day.  • Power #6 (Stealth): The owner can cast mislead once per day.  • Powers #7-8 (8 ranks in another skill): Yet to be discovered.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 53","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Shinobi Fuhonsen","cl":15,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"illusion"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"shinobiFuhonsenArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"neck","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264893,"modifiedTime":1677435299246,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

If consulted, it grants a +10 bonus on all Knowledge (geography) checks made to navigate or to answer questions about outer space. Once per month, it may be used to contact alien minds on far-flung worlds-this works identically to the spell contact other plane (use the demigod line to determine the effects of the spell or to determine ability score decreases).

Each gate of a portal network is bound to at least one other such gate and instantly transports any creature who steps through it to its mate, anywhere on the same plane or any other plane. Portal network gates allow the passage of Large or smaller creatures. Huge creatures are not transported, even if they manage to squeeze through the ring. If the destination gate is obstructed by an immovable object, the network fails to function.  Portal networks with more than two gates distinguish between destinations via focal objects chosen by the gates' creators. Typical focal objects include gems, minor magic items, and carefully drawn sigils. Some gates fail to function at all if entered without a focal object, whereas others transport the subject to a default location. Creatures can share a focal object by touching each other as they pass through the gate. Gates with multiple focal objects have a set priority (established at the creation of the portal network) that determines which focal objects supersede the others.  Portal networks work an unlimited number of times. Once a gate is activated, impenetrable darkness fills the gate's ring until 1 round after the last creature passes through. A creature doesn't reach the other end until it passes fully through the ring, and can't see the other side until it finishes passing through.  If a portal network requires a focal object, only creatures using a focal object or touching someone else who is can pass through a gate, even if the gate is activated. Obstructing a gate (such as by building a wall against the gate's opening) prevents anyone from passing through, but a creature standing in the way does not; a creature occupying the gate is pushed aside once anyone passes through.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Occult Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":64000},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Portal Network","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"portalNetworkArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264896,"modifiedTime":1677435299246,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

To activate the cauldron, a mythic creature must spill some of its own blood into the black basin as an offering of his mythic power. If the wound deals at least 4 points of damage, the cauldron drains one use of the individual's mythic power through it. Once activated, the cauldron fills with a strange red fog that remains for 1d20+10 minutes. During this time, mythic creatures can enter the cauldron and be transported to the crossroads. Non-mythic creatures that enter the cauldron take 4d6 points of damage per round until they climb out or die.   The netherworld is small, with an overall area of 1 square half-mile. Highly mutable, the netherworld's appearance is determined by the will of whatever outsider currently waits there. Only one outsider can inhabit the netherworld at any given time. The specifics of what entity resides in the netherworld, as well as that entity's desire, change frequently and therefore are left to the discretion of the GM.   Time in the netherworld passes out of sync with time in the Material Plane, thus a mythic creature can remain in the netherworld for as long as he wishes, and reemerges from the cauldron only a few minutes after his descent. The netherworld is a crossroads, coterminous with all planes. Outsiders can enter from any plane, but mortals can't travel to other planes from the netherworld.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Mythic Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0.5},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Netherworld Cauldron","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"netherworldCauldronArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264917,"modifiedTime":1677435299248,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Each casting restores 1 charge, but the staff may never hold more than 10 charges at any one time.

{"_id":"YwNJNOWXXfU0YxQE","name":"Deck Of Many Things [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>A deck of many things is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.  The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards.  Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are clarified below.  Balance: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level.  Comet: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level.  Donjon: This card signifies imprisonment-either by the imprisonment spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards.  Euryale: The medusa-like visage of this card brings a curse that only the Fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent.  The Fates: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation.  Flames: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days.  Fool: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Jester.  Gem: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, and the gems are worth 1,000 gp each.  Idiot: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional.  Jester: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Fool. The redraws are optional.  Key: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand.  Knight: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. This fighter can be taken as a cohort by a character with the Leadership feat.  Moon: This card bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received.  Rogue: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and made forever hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect.  Ruin: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost.  Skull: A dread wraith appears. The character must fight it alone-if others help, dread wraiths appear to fight them as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle.  Star: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities.  Sun: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated.  Talons: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably lost, except for the deck.  Throne: The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour).  Vizier: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within 1 year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another matter entirely.  The Void: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards.   PLAQUE TAROT CARD PLAYING CARD SUMMARY OF EFFECT  Balance XI.

Each time it is picked up by a new user, the monkey's paw grants that creature three wishes, as if it were a ring of three wishes. Once a new user picks up the monkey's paw, it cannot be discarded, not even by way of a wish or a miracle spell. Even if stolen, it reappears among the user's possessions within 1d4 hours. It can only be parted from its bearer when all three of its wishes are used or it is destroyed-but such a feat takes time and patience. When a bearer uses a wish granted by the monkey's paw, he is then subject to a curse, as per the spell major curse (DC 25 to remove; Ultimate Magic 215). This curse manifests as the creature taking a -4 penalty to attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks until the curse is removed. These penalties are cumulative in cases where multiple wishes are used before past curses are removed. Once all three wishes are used, the monkey paw plane shifts to a random plane and begins the process anew.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Ultimate Equipment","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Monkey's Paw","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"necromancy and universal"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"monkeysPawArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264938,"modifiedTime":1677435299249,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Attached to the front of the chair is a 12-foot-long, hollow mithral cylinder wound with a fine braid of incredibly thin copper wire and set at a variable angle to allow it to be aimed like a siege weapon. At the cylinder's end is a small clamp designed to hold a large crystal through which the cannon's beam travels, acting as a focal lens.   Once per week, the quake cannon can be activated to create an earthquake effect (as the spell) centered on any point within 50 miles. Activating the cannon takes 10 minutes, and a diamond worth at least 10,000 gp must be used as the device's focal lens. This diamond is expended in the process of firing the weapon.  If an eidite gem worth at least 5,000 gp is instead used as a focal lens, the quake cannon does not create an earthquake at the targeted location, but instead fires an ultrasonic pulse that affects only clockworks within the same area of effect as the cannon's normal earthquake effect. Any constructs with the clockwork subtype in the affected area must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or be overwhelmed with electromagnetic impulses and ultrasonic disruptions. Clockwork creatures that fail their saving throws against this effect become confused for 1 minute. During this time and for 24 hours afterward, affected creatures are compelled to move toward the quake canon as fast as they can.

{"_id":"ZdA7VRY4YjieoGj0","name":"Oculus of Abaddon [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>An oculus of Abaddon is a potent artifact rumored to have been created by one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as a way to reward those who work as their agents on the Material Plane. More likely, these items were crafted by a powerful pre- Earthfall race that has long since moved on, leaving behind these dangerous artifacts to tempt mortals into serving the needs of the Horsemen. An oculus of Abaddon appears as a sphere of clear crystal that contains a pinpoint of flickering red light at its center. When held, the oculus feels warm to the touch and fills the holder with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place the oculus within the socket-this causes 1d8 points of damage, 1 point of bleed damage, and 2 points of Constitution damage. Once placed in an eye socket, the oculus can only be removed by ripping it free (causing the same amount of damage as the initial plucking). An oculus placed in an empty eye socket immediately heals all damage caused by plucking the previous eye out. Once placed, an oculus allows its new owner to utilize its powers, as listed below. • Darkvision to a range of 120 feet (constant) • True seeing once per day as a free action • Greater scrying three times per day • Planar binding once per week (only to summon natives of Abaddon, such as daemons or soul eaters) • Familiar farsight at will (if the user has a familiar or an animal companion, he may use clairaudience/clairvoyance to observe the world through his familiar, despite any intervening distance as long as he and the familiar are on the same plane) The oculus of Abaddon's greatest power, though, is its haunting beckon. This ability is usable once per year, and allows the user to manipulate the minds of a huge number of targets, provided that the end goal of the manipulation is a tragic or otherwise horrific fate for those being manipulated. This functions as mass charm monster, but with a range of 1 mile, and establishes a telepathic link between the caster and all minds in that area. The effects are still language-dependant despite this telepathy-creatures without the ability to understand language (typically, creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower) are unaffected. All other creatures are automatically affected unless they have 6 or more HD, in which case they gain a DC 22 Will save to resist the effects. Spell resistance applies regardless of HD. The oculus of Abaddon is powerfully neutral evil and possesses a limited and hateful intellect of its own. While not capable of communicating directly with its owner, it refuses to activate its powers for any user who is not neutral evil.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 33","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Oculus of Abaddon","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration divination and necromancy"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"oculusOfAbaddonArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"eyes","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264943,"modifiedTime":1677435299250,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

{"_id":"aXufIjj7Ue4KTOCB","name":"Mask Of The Forgotten Pharaoh [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Carved from gold and inlaid with cobalt, lapis lazuli, and onyx, this elaborate funerary mask was crafted for the Sky Pharaoh Hakotep I, and was intended to be interred along with his mummy in his tomb. Upon Hakotep's death, the Nethysian sect called the Sacrosanct Order of the Blue Feather trapped a portion of Hakotep's soul-his ka, or vital spark-inside the mask and stole it from the pharaoh's tomb. To conceal this crime, the Order of the Blue Feather hid the mask (which came to be known as the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh) beneath the Sanctum of the Erudite Eye in Wati, where it was found  millennia later by the necromancer Nebta-Khufre. Empowered by Hakotep's ka, the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh is a powerful artifact. When worn, the mask occupies both the head and headband magic item slots. After 24 hours, the mask attunes itself to its wearer, granting its wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to one of his mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). The wearer chooses which ability score is enhanced the first time he puts on the mask. If the mask grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants ranks in skills as a headband of vast intelligence: first in Knowledge (nobility), then, as the bonuses increase, in Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (religion). Once the mask is attuned to a wearer, the enhanced ability score cannot be changed unless the mask attunes itself to a new wearer (which takes another 24 hours). In addition, the mask provides its wearer with deathwatch as a constant spell-like ability. The mask cannot be detected by any sort of divination magic, and grants its wearer a constant nondetection effect.  Once attuned, the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh has additional powers based on its wearer's alignment. If worn by an evil character, the mask enhances the wearer's control over undead, doubling the number of undead the wearer may control with animate dead, control undead, the Command Undead feat, and similar effects. Additionally, the wearer can cast animate dead once per day as a spell-like ability. If worn by a good character, the mask grants its wearer immunity to disease, including supernatural diseases such as mummy rot. In addition, the wearer can cast death ward and speak with dead each once per day as a spell-like ability. A neutral character who is neither good nor evil must choose to be treated as either good or evil when he first dons the mask. Once made, this choice cannot be reversed. A neutral character who uses the mask to create undead gains 1 permanent negative level for each Hit Die of undead created. These negative levels cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells), but they are immediately removed if the undead creatures are destroyed. The Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh reveals additional powers as its wearer increases in levels. At 7th level, the mask's enhancement bonus to a mental ability score increases to +4. Also at this level, an evil wearer can cast create undead once per day, and a good wearer can cast eyebite once per day instead. At 11th level, the mask's enhancement bonus increases to +6, an evil wearer can cast control undead once per day, and a good wearer can cast finger of death once per day. At 15th level, an evil wearer can cast create greater undead once per day, and a good wearer can cast symbol of death once per day. Legends hint at unspeakable rituals that can use the Mask of the Forgotten Pharaoh to create a ka pulse, channeling the energy of Hakotep's fractured soul to animate huge numbers of undead creatures in a wide area, though doing so is rumored to destroy the wearer's own ka, thereby denying the wearer access to the afterlife and enslaving his will to that of the Forgotten Pharaoh.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 80","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":5},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Mask Of The Forgotten Pharaoh","cl":17,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"necromancy and transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"maskOfTheForgottenPharaohArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"head","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428264949,"modifiedTime":1677435299250,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures.   In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the Leadership feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can view only places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the Fly skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a Fly check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has the ability to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities.   • Call lightning storm 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability.   • Guards and wards 1/day on the central tower.   • Storm of vengeance 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet).   • Wind wall at will. This effect surrounds the entire castle at a range of 100 feet, and can be raised or lowered by the master (or a creature he or she designates) from the control room or any tower as a standard action.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Ultimate Equipment","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Cloud Castle Of The Storm King","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"all schools"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"cloudCastleOfTheStormKingArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265066,"modifiedTime":1677435299251,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
{"_id":"e1cB92BHg8cdLkSu","name":"Book Of The Damned [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The Book of the Damned contains the greatest collection of profane lore in the multiverse. This blasphemous book consists of numerous scattered chapters divided into three volumes: daemonic, demonic, and diabolic. These three sections are typically discovered on their own, as complete works in their own right. A fourth volume of unbound pages impaled on a bloody spike of metal-a collection of apocryphal notes-exists  as well; its pages explore the nature and realms of evils other than daemons, demons, and devils. Should all three volumes and their apocrypha be brought together, they merge into a compiled compilation that exhibits the following abilities.  The Book of the Damned radiates an unhallow effect in a 150- foot radius and a sympathy effect tuned to attract all evil creatures. Any good creature that willingly touches the tome must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be slain (this is a death effect). While the Book of the Damned is outside of its repository (see below), any fiendish demigod or greater fiendish power can use scry or a similar spell to view the Book of the Damned and its reader with no risk of being detected by the bearer. Finally, a creature that makes use of any of the tome's abilities is itself damned, condemned to an evil Outer Plane after death regardless of its other deeds. Only the intervention of a deity can prevent this punishment.  The complete Book of the Damned can be used as a profane talisman, as an obscene reference volume, and as a gate to the multiverse's most complete repository of unholy lore.  Talisman: As long as the book is carried, its bearer casts spells with the evil descriptor as if she were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +5 bonus on all Charisma-based checks when interacting with evil outsiders. The bearer can also use these spell-like abilities.  At will-align weapon (evil only), bestow curse, detect evil, speak with dead  3/day-banishment, blasphemy, dictum, magic circle (all variants), unhallow, unholy aura, unholy blight, word of chaos  1/day-dimensional lock, gate, greater planar binding, soul bind  Reference: Any character who can read Abyssal, Celestial, and Infernal and who spends a total of 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) studying the tome learns soul-tainting secrets. She gains a +10 bonus on Knowledge (planes) checks whenever she consults the book for 1 hour regarding a particular question. Additionally, the book's descriptions of Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell prove so vivid that teleportation effects she uses to reach or move within those planes always bring her to the desired location (no mishap roll required). The bearer of the Book of the Damned also gains a +5 bonus on the opposed Charisma check required by the planar binding spell (this bonus stacks with the +5 bonus the tome grants on interactions with evil outsiders).  Once per day, the bearer can ask the tome a question relating to any profane topic; she then opens the book to a random page to find the answer, revealed as if the bearer had cast vision.  The book also contains every spell with the evil spell descriptor.  Repository: Once per day, the bearer of the Book of the Damned can cause the tome to disappear into its own internal demiplane, leaving behind a sinister, shimmering portal. This allows the bearer and those she chooses to enter an unnerving but semisafe library filled with countless volumes of blasphemous records, as detailed on pages 167-170 of this book. The book and creatures within the repository are affected by a powerful nondetection effect, shielding all within from the sight of even the gods. Creatures don't age while inside the library, although upon leaving, they immediately age an amount equal to the  time they spent inside. While within the demiplane, visitors can access any of the powers described in Reference above.  Nonevil creatures find the macabre surroundings and eerie servants within the repository unsettling and must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be afflicted as if by the spell nightmare every time they attempt to rest within. Nothing can prevent this effect.  Creatures other than those the bearer chooses can enter the Book of the Damned's repository during lunar eclipses and the midnight hour on the night of a new moon. The barely visible portal manifests as a normal door at these times.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Book of the Damned","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":40},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Book Of The Damned","cl":25,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"all schools [chaotic lawful evil]"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"bookOfTheDamnedArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265067,"modifiedTime":1677435299251,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The bottle's tight-fitting stopper is engraved with sigils of binding and sealed with lead. Legends say a wizard of tremendous power and wisdom enchanted a fiendish army and trapped it within the bottle for all time. The Legion of the Bound may be called forth from the bottle by its wielder and forced to serve, as they were once commanded to build a fantastic ancient city, long since buried beneath the dust of the ages. But the bottle endures, its inhabitants still bound.   A would-be wielder of the Bottle of the Bound must know three secret commands: the Word of Opening, to unseal the bottle so the stopper can be removed; the Word of Binding, to call forth and command its denizens; and the Word of Banishment, to return the Bound Ones to the bottle. A holder who knows the words may use the bottle like a summon monster IX spell at will, except only creatures of the evil subtype can be summoned. The summoned creatures remain until the sun next rises or sets, and no new creatures can be summoned from the bottle until the initial summoned creatures' destruction or return.   No known force can open the bottle without the Word of Opening. If the bottle is opened without the use of the Word of Binding, its 666 inhabitants are freed, one each minute starting from 1st-level creatures and moving on to higher-level ones, until they all escape. If one of the Bound is called forth and commanded without the Word of Banishment being uttered, it is free after it performs the task for which it was summoned. The Words to use the Bottle of the Bound have been lost for uncounted years, although some sages believe they know at least one or two of them.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Ultimate Equipment","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":4},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Bottle Of The Bound","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"abjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"bottleOfTheBoundArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265070,"modifiedTime":1677435299251,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

{"_id":"fmOGwAbTiBRhcwT8","name":"Apocalypse Box [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This small, innocuous, black wooden box appears randomly throughout the multiverse, drawn to great heroes, greedy rulers, and desperate (and often morally ambiguous) mortals. The Apocalypse Box appears subtly, sometimes as a dusty old box on a shelf or a forgotten heirloom in a grandparent's attic. A creature looking upon the Apocalypse Box is struck with a sensation of nearly overwhelming avarice, and must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or be compelled to touch the box. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. If a creature touches the Apocalypse Box, she must succeed at another DC 30 Will save or fall under the box's curse. Cursed creatures are compelled to use any available means-including fleeing from or murdering friends and loved ones-to keep the box out of the hands of others. This curse can't be broken until the cursed creature dies or the box is destroyed. Additionally, if the cursed creature moves more than 10 feet away from the box, she immediately takes 1d4 points of Wisdom damage plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage each subsequent day until she and the Apocalypse Box are reunited.  Only a creature bearing the Apocalypse Box's curse can open it. Once per day, the cursed creature can open the box and draw forth a single item her heart desires. The item must be nonmagical, weigh no more than 50 pounds, and be worth no more than 50,000 gp, but is otherwise limited only by the parameters of the wish spell. A mythic character can expend two uses of mythic power to draw forth a second such item each day.  Each time the Apocalypse Box is opened, there is a 50% chance that instead of granting a wish, the box summons a number of horrific monsters that immediately attack anyone in sight and remain to wreak havoc on the Material Plane for 1 week before returning to their plane of origin. Roll on Table 5-1 below to determine the monsters that appear.  The Apocalypse Box is quite tenacious in its desire for someone to open it. Each day, the cursed creature must succeed at a Will save or be compelled to open it. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is initially 20, but increases by 2 each subsequent day the box isn't opened until the cursed creature fails the Will save, at which point she opens the box and the save DC resets to 20.

It functions as a +2 impactUE warhammer that automatically resizes itself to match the size of its wielder. Once per day as a full-round   action, the wielder of Agrimmosh can use the hammer to cast heightened enlarge person (Fortitude D C 23 negates). This effect lasts for 20 minutes. Whenever the wielder of Agrimmosh confirms a critical hit against a creature of the humanoid type, the target creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or shrink by one size category, as by heightened reduce person. This effect lasts for 20 minutes.  In addition, Agrimmosh has other powers that are currently dormant. When the Hammer of Unmaking is struck against Minderhal's Forge in the Cathedral of Minderhal (see Pathfinder Adventure Path #93: Forge of the Giant God), these powers are reawakened, and Agrimmosh gains the following abilities.  Whenever the wielder of Agrimmosh successfully strikes a creature with the hammer, as an immediate action he can attempt a targeted dispel check against the struck creature, as dispel magic, to end a single ongoing transmutation effect that alters the target's size. Other ongoing spells and effects are unaffected. The wielder uses the hammer's caster level as his own when attempting such a dispel check.   Agrimmosh also gains 3 charges, which renew at the beginning of each day. The wielder can expend the listed number of charges to activate one of the following spell-like abilities as a full-round action; expending an extra charge to activate the spell-like ability reduces the casting time to a swift action instead. Regardless, the wielder of Agrimmosh can activate only one of the weapon's spell-like abilities per round.  • Heightened enlarge person (1 charge, DC 23; this replaces Agrimmosh's 1/day enlarge person ability)  • Heightened mass enlarge person (2 charges, DC 23)  Lastly, Agrimmosh can be used in conjunction with Minderhal's Forge at the Cathedral of Minderhal to resize magic armor and weapons.

This deposits the wielder and up to eight creatures touched in area A1. Conversely, the wielder and up to eight creatures touched can exit the demiplane from anywhere in the realm as a standard action; they then find themselves at the top of the tower on the Material Plane.  • The wielder does not set off any of the Prismatic Lantern's defenses, and creatures within don't hinder the efforts or movement of the wielder or her allies unless attacked.  • With a mental command, the wielder can activate any of the Prismatic Lantern's defenses, and call for aid both from the protectors of the demiplane and the wielders of other crystal control rods on the Material Plane.  • The wielder can control the flow of energy into the rod's associated elemental node (see area B2).  • The wielder is alerted via a mental alarm if any of the elemental nodes come under attack or if the wielder of another crystal control rod summons help.

So potent is this elixir that it must be stored in a magically reinforced cold iron flask capped with a mixture of lead and demon ichor-the flask itself is essentially a wondrous magic item that does nothing else and costs 8,000 gp to craft. Even then, the elixir's essence fills a 10-foot-radius area with unholy energies that sicken all living creatures (this is a poison effect with no saving throw). If the flask is opened, this radius expands to 30 feet. A thin sheet of lead, 1 inch of common metal, or 1 foot of stone blocks this effect. Once the flask is opened, the elixir must be imbibed within 1 minute; re-capping the elixir at this point doesn't reset or pause this countdown. If the elixir has not been imbibed in that time, the energy within explodes in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals 15d6 points of unholy damage (Will DC 25 half) to all creatures in the area of effect, destroying the elixir.   If a creature drinks a Nahyndrian elixir, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of Constitution drain (demons automatically succeed). If a non-mythic chaotic evil creature succeeds, it undergoes mythic ascension-gaining either the first tier in a mythic path or a mythic rank, at the GM's discretion. A chaotic evil creature that is already mythic treats a Nahyndrian elixir as nectar of the gods (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 155).

Additionally, when the harp grants its morale bonus, each creature of any alignment within range that is subject to an ongoing negative effect (such as possession, a spell of the compulsion subschool, or a similar effect) can immediately attempt a new saving throw with a +1 bonus to break free of the effect. If the effect does not ordinarily allow a saving throw to resist it, the harp does not grant one.  If the harp is played for an hour in the same place on a second consecutive night (24 hours later), in addition to extending the duration of the morale bonus provided to good-aligned creatures, the harp grants a new saving throw to creatures under ongoing negative effects as described above, this time with a +3 bonus. If the harp is played for an hour in the same place on a third consecutive night, the morale bonus is again extended, and creatures suffering from ongoing negative effects receive a new saving throw to break free, this time with a +5 bonus.  After being played for 3 consecutive nights, the harp cannot be used again to grant morale bonuses or new saving throws for a month.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Nidal, Land of Shadows","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":75},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Harp Of Night's Hope","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"abjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"harpOfNightsHopeArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265102,"modifiedTime":1677435299253,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
{"_id":"iVCjjUXfUlW3rHGp","name":"Hermetic Flask [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This humble-looking, round-bottomed flask was used to purify one of the legendary philosopher's stones, and acquired some special properties as a side effect of this use. The hermetic flask and its creations function for only users with the alchemy class feature (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 26) and the ability to make extracts. Using the flask normally requires an alchemist's lab or crafting kit. Makeshift tools can be used, but result in a -5 penalty on all checks.   If a user spends 10 minutes and 100 gp, and succeeds at a DC 30 Craft (alchemy) check, the flask can distill one dose of alchemical essence. If the user expends one use of mythic power during the distilling process, 10 doses are made instead. Alchemical essence remains stable only as long as it's contained within the hermetic flask. As a standard action, an alchemist can pour forth a dose and immediately convert it into an alchemical item worth 100 gp or less, or into a poison worth 1,000 gp or less. He may throw it or apply it as part of the same standard action.   A weapon-like liquid, such as alchemist's fire, congeals into a fragile globule and remains stable until thrown or otherwise broken. Any such substance poured from the flask remains stable for 1 minute, and then dissolves harmlessly. The purity of the alchemical essence increases the effectiveness of alchemical items derived from it. Any save DCs associated with the item increase by 2, and any damage caused or healed by it increases by 50% (including ability damage). The hermetic flask can hold a maximum of 10 doses of alchemical essence at a time.   The user can identify the properties of an unknown alchemical substance or poison by pouring it into an empty hermetic flask and succeeding at a DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check for a normal substance, or a DC 30 or 35 check for a rarer substance. This analysis takes 1 minute and doesn't destroy the substance. Poisons analyzed in the flask can be converted into an antidote as part of this check, consuming the poison in the process. Such an antidote automatically cures the poison in any creature currently suffering from it, and provides immunity to further exposure to that specific poison for 24 hours. The antidote remains stable for as long as it's within the flask, and for 1 minute after it's removed.   By expending one use of mythic power and using the flask as part of a Craft check, the user can halve the cost of materials needed to create an alchemical item or poison. This doesn't apply to the creation of alchemical essence.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Mythic Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Hermetic Flask","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"hermeticFlaskArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265103,"modifiedTime":1677435299253,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Once per day, the bearer can invoke a form of fire shield that protects against cold attacks and damages opponents with fire and holy damage similarly to the spell flame strike. Once per round as an immediate action, if an adjacent ally is hit by a ranged or melee attack, the bearer can use the shield to redirect the attack to himself, taking all effects from that attack as if he were the intended target. All allies within 100 feet of the bearer gain the effect of bless and prayer. Additionally, all allies within 100 feet of the bearer know his relative position and condition, as per the spell status.  Beyond these properties, the Shield of Aroden is designed to protect its bearer from death. Any attack that would kill the bearer (not merely make him unconscious or dying) triggers this ability, redirecting the lethal attack fully upon the shield and leaving the bearer unharmed (even if the attack normally only works on living creatures). For example, if the bearer failed a saving throw against flesh to stone, the shield would turn to stone and shatter instead, whereas if the bearer failed his save against horrid wilting, the shield would turn to dry splinters. This power always destroys the shield, reducing it to 1d20 nearly invulnerable shards that suggest the way in which it was last destroyed.  The Shield of Aroden bestows two negative levels on any chaotic creature that attempts to wield it. These negative levels remain as long as the shield is held or carried. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the creature possesses the shield.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +5 light fortification spell resistance (17) heavy wooden shield</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Artifacts and Legends","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":10},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Shield Of Aroden","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"abjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"shieldOfArodenArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"shield","equipmentSubtype":"lightArmor","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265106,"modifiedTime":1677435299253,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

While wearing a crown of the simurgh, the wearer is constantly affected by the spell protection from evil. Once per day, the wearer of this crown can spend a full-round action concentrating to mentally contact the simurgh who created the crown.

Ten minutes after teleporting to the simurgh's side, however, the crown's wearer teleports back to wherever he was before teleporting (or the nearest safe square), whether he wishes to or not.

No matter how many pages are turned, another always remains. Anyone opening the Codex for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a destruction spell (Fortitude DC 30). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the Codex allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the insanity spell). The powers of the Codex of the Infinite Planes are as follows: astral projection, banishment, elemental swarm, gate, greater planar ally, greater planar binding, plane shift, and soul bind. Each of these spell-like abilities are usable at will by the owner of the Codex (assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The Codex of the Infinite Planes has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates that a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can incur only one catastrophe per power use.  d% CATASTROPHE  01-25 Natural Fury: An earthquake spell centered on the reader strikes every round for 1 minute, and an intensified storm of vengeance spell is centered and targeted on the reader.  26-50 Fiendish Vengeance: A gate opens and 1d3+1 balors, pit fiends, or similar evil outsiders step through and attempt to destroy the owner of the Codex.  51-75 Ultimate Imprisonment: Reader's soul is captured (as trap the soul; no save allowed) in a random gem somewhere on the plane while his or her body is entombed beneath the earth (as imprisonment).  76-100 Death: The reader utters a wail of the banshee and then is subject to a destruction spell.

{"_id":"ixta6SuflR8Ps4Rq","name":"Anima Engine [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>This great contraption seems to be an endless series of winding tubes, glass spheres, metallic and crystal structural beams, and even more exotic materials fused into an icosahedral shape. The facets of the engine cascade with electrical and eldritch energies. Roughly 40 ft. in diameter, the engine is a marvel of craftsmanship for its sheer size alone. Surrounding the base of the structure are nine box-like containers of various sizes.  Aside from its size and obvious power, the most frightening aspect of the anima engine is what it is able to do. The engine captures the latent soul energy of any being dying within a 1 mile radius. This energy is stored in the engine and may be used to fuel both arcane and divine magic. Souls are not immediately used by the engine; they are stored within the machine's power reservoir for a matter of time (GM to determine exact length of time if necessary; allow any dead PCs the chance at resurrection). The limits on what can be accomplished with the anima engine are unknown. In addition to passively collecting soul energy, the anima engine may be used to actively drain a target of its animating force. The necromantic power of the engine is strong enough that if a target is placed in one of the sarcophagus-shaped retainers surrounding the engine, the target's soul is torn from the still living body (DC 40 Fortitude save allows the target to withstand the process for 1 round; save each round). This process of draining splits the victim into two parts; soul energy, captured in the engine, and a soulless husk of a still-living being. The victim's body is then freed to be used as a physical tool for Orcus (by his ally, Glazerel), ideally giving the Demon Lord both benefits: a soul to be used to fuel his dungeon and shrines, and a physical being to be used to do his bidding (the victims of the anima engine gain the soulless template [see Appendix A]).  The anima engine has 9 receptacles encircling its bulk; 3 Small, 3 Medium, 2 Large, and 1 Huge. Each of the receptacles can receive an appropriately-sized occupant, and a smaller subject may be placed in a receptacle one size larger than they are (a Small subject may be placed in a Medium receptacle, but not a Large).  Targets subjected to the anima engine suffer the effects of losing their soul, but retain most of their abilities (subject to the soulless template). Their memories are intact (a tormenting reminder of their former lives), but they follow the orders of Orcus implicitly, not as automatons but as fully capable beings.  Currently, there is only one being in the multiverse that knows the proper way to use the anima engine, the diabolic archwizard Glazerel. If the anima engine falls into the control of the PCs, allow any with an Intelligence of 24 or better the opportunity to make a DC 50 Use Magic Device check to attempt to control the engine, and loose some of its energy. Failure indicates magical backlash (a defense mechanism constructed into the engine by Glazerel, as a safeguard he is never replaced), requiring a DC 40 Fortitude save or the controller is subject to a maximized disintegration (CL 30th), and anyone within 30 ft. of the engine (including the operator) is subject to a heightened chain lightning (CL 30th, spell level 9th, DC 26 Reflex save for half).  Should the PC manage to successfully harness the power of the anima engine, allow them the ability to duplicate any one spell effect (divine or arcane), modified with any metamagic feats, up to a combined spell level of 10th; i.e. the PCs might create the effect of a maximized prismatic spray or such. Note that once the PCs determine what the engine is, and how it works (preparing to Use Magic Device), actually using it is considered an evil act. PCs with alignment considerations will be severely affected (good clerics lose spellcasting powers for 1 week, paladins stripped of abilities until they atone, etc.). The anima engine currently stores enough soul energy for 2 successful magical effects before new subject must be placed in the receptacles.  The anima engine was used in the construction of Rappan Athuk, and is the power source for many of the unusual magic effects present in the dungeon.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Rappan Athuk","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":8},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Anima Engine","cl":30,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"transmutation strong all schools"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"animaEngineArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265111,"modifiedTime":1677435299254,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

If it already has darkvision, the range of its darkvision is increased by 60 ft.  • The wearer does not need to breathe or eat.  • The wearer is immune to electricity and poison.  • The wearer gains resistance to acid 10, cold 10 and fire 10.  • The wearer gains telepathy and speaks Abyssal, Celestial, and Draconic.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +5 heavy fortification full plate</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Ultimate Equipment","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":80},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Demon Prince Armor","cl":22,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"necromancy"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"demonPrinceArmorArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"armor","equipmentSubtype":"lightArmor","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265113,"modifiedTime":1677435299254,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

However, a bearer not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she makes use of its powers. A book of infinite spells contains 1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a d% roll: 01-50, arcane spell; 51-100, divine spell. Determine the exact spell randomly.  Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back-paging through the book is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes.  Once per day, the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as if from a scroll, nor can they be copied into a spellbook-their magic is bound permanently within the book itself.  The owner of the book need not have the book in her possession in order to use its power. The book can be stored elsewhere and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power, so long as no other creature attempts to make use of the book, in so doing becoming its owner.  Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is.

Made of precious metals and gemstones, the forge is surprisingly resilient, and even hard metals can be crafted upon its seemingly soft, delicate surfaces.  Any item crafted with this forge can be constructed in half the normal amount of time.  When the forge's furnace is fed by a specific set of bellows, currently buried beside the remains of Naika Omenspeaker (see area 10), the flames glow with a divine radiance and emit no noticeable heat, allowing for forging at a temperature more comfortable to the crafter. While the Soulforge is so lit, if a character's successful Craft (armor, jewelry, locks, or weapons) check result using the forge exceeds DC 40, that crafter garners Magrim's favor and can choose from one of the three following special rewards.  First, the crafter can ask of the god a single miracle, so long as the request does not conflict with Magrim's lawful neutral alignment. A creature can receive at most one such miracle over the course of her life.  Second, at the GM's discretion, the crafter can override the destruction conditions of a minor artifact without a lawful aura and destroy it in the Soulforge.  Finally, the crafter can choose for her soul to pass from her body, traveling through the Soulforge to Magrim's realm in the Boneyard, effectively causing the crafter to die. Magrim immediately ushers the crafter's soul before Pharasma for judgment and petitions on her behalf before the Lady of Graves, advocating for his most faithful followers to find ultimate rest in the realm best befitting their lives.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Tombs Of Golarion","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Soulforge","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"evocation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"soulforgeArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265116,"modifiedTime":1677435299254,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

In addition, the wearer is immune to smite effects (including the smite evil ability of celestial creatures and paladins, and the destructive smite ability of the Destruction domain).

The wearer gains the see in darkness universal monster ability, and the ability to use discern lies, nondetection, and true seeing as constant spell-like abilities.

{"_id":"kYSVNqvPPwAL40fI","name":"Soul Portrait [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>A soul portrait is a painting imbued with immense magical power attached to a solid wooden frame. The exact image presented on each soul portrait varies, and has a magical effect only if it depicts the likeness of its current owner. The owner doesn't need to be depicted alone, and additional figures painted in the background don't interfere with the effect.  The owner of a soul portrait doesn't appear to age and no  longer takes the penalties associated with aging, but she still gains the appropriate mental bonuses. As the owner would normally age, the portrait appears to age instead. The owner of a soul portrait does not die of old age. If someone benefitting from this effect ceases to be the portrait's owner, she immediately gains all associated physical penalties from her current age, and her appearance changes appropriately; if the owner is past her maximum age, she withers and dies instantly.  When scrutinized by magical means (such as aura sightACG, detect evil, detect magic, or discern lies), the owner gains the benefits of a special misdirection with no saving throw allowed for the would-be investigator. For the purposes of the misdirection, the soul portrait provides results as the owner would have when she first acquired the portrait. Unlike a normal misdirection, this effect is not limited to spells that detect her aura. Whenever it would be beneficial to her, the owner counts as her younger self for any spell or effect that gathers information. For instance, if she denies committing a crime she perpetrated after she commissioned the portrait, all forms of truth magic would reveal her denial as being true. Even spells like detect thoughts would reveal the thoughts of her younger self.  When the portrait's owner would take ability damage, ability drain, or negative levels, she takes no adverse effects until they would be fatal (though she continues to accrue them in the portrait), and her image on the soul portrait twists in horrific agony as if suffering for its owner. Whenever any of the accrued maladies would be fatal (such as a number of negative levels equal to the owner's Hit Dice), the owner immediately dies. The soul portrait can be healed of ability damage, ability drain, and negative levels to reduce the accrued maladies by any effects that would normally heal these maladies.  When the owner of a soul portrait dies, her soul is pulled into the canvas and her likeness becomes a character in the background, leaving space for a new portrait. A creature can claim ownership over a soul portrait by commissioning an artist to paint her likeness over the original image. The new owner must be present and willing while the artist paints, and the artist must succeed at a DC 25 Craft (painting) check to create a sufficient likeness for the artifact to accept the new owner. Once this happens, if the previous owner is still alive, she ceases to be the soul portrait's owner and ages as described above. The portrait can't be cut, burned, or otherwise damaged, except as described in the destruction requirements below.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Occult Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":25},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Soul Portrait","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"necromancy"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"soulPortraitArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265121,"modifiedTime":1677435299254,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The ancestral blade of the Amatatsu family, Suishen is believed to contain the soul of the first Amatatsu emperor of Minkai. It has been passed down through generations of the family, serving as advisor and spiritual guide. It was actually Suishen's idea to be sold to Fynn Snaevald in order to save the family line.  Suishen can detect any scion of the Amatatsu family within 60 feet, whether a natural-born descendant or a person invested with the right to rule as an Amatatsu (such as a creature marked by the Amatatsu Seal). Although Suishen is neutral good, any Amatatsu scion, regardless of alignment, can wield the sword without gaining a negative level. This boon is at Suishen's discretion, however, and should such a scion ever betray the family or prove unworthy as an heir, the sword can reinstate this penalty and cause a personality conflict. Even though Suishen can likely dominate anyone who tries to wield it, the sword usually acquiesces to the wishes of its wielder, provided she is a rightful Amatatsu scion-though after 50 years of holding its silence, Suishen is a bit rough as a conversationalist, communicating in a very gruff, no-nonsense manner.  Suishen has a number of additional abilities as well, though it reveals these powers to its wielder only after she has shown herself honorable and worthy of bearing the family's heirloom blade. Each time Suishen's wielder is involved in a fight in which an oni of the Five Storms (such as Kimandatsu) is killed, the wielder is made aware of one new power in the following order. If a new person wields Suishen, that person must learn the sword's additional powers all over again.  • Resist energy (cold) 3/day becomes protection from energy (cold) at will.  • Suishen gains the flaming burst ability.  • Invisibility purge at will.  • Suishen gains the bane ability against creatures with the oni subtype.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 50","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":6},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Suishen, Guardian of the Amatatsu","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"evocation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"suishenGuardianOfTheAmatatsuArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265124,"modifiedTime":1677435299254,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

When a creature holding the knucklebone of fickle fortune looks upon it, he sees that the bone is actually a perfectly shaped die with 20 sides, each side bearing a glowing red symbol of power. When the creature rolls the die, instead of falling to the floor it rolls upward in mid-air, stopping at the eye level of the creature who rolled it. It then takes its effect, based on the side immediately facing its caster. Roll a 20-sided die to determine the effect (see the table). For effects that are lost if the die is rolled again (such as #17) or a specific result is rolled (such as #14), the character is aware of this restriction.    d20 RUNE NAME EFFECT  1 Eya-Doh The character gains 1 permanent negative level.  2 Bvu The character is subject to a powerful compulsion never to roll the knucklebone of fickle fortune again. He can shake this compulsion only by succeeding a DC 25 Will saving throw. He can attempt this saving throw only once per day.  3 Eij The character is affected by a harm spell (caster level 15th).  4 Hor The character is subject to a powerful compulsion to roll the knucklebone three more times immediately (Will DC 25 negates). All three of these rolls are made with a -5 penalty on the knucklebone's die roll (minimum 1).  5 Veh The character is blinded as with blindness/deafness (no saving throw).  6 Chu The character takes 5d10 points of cold damage (DC 25 Fort save for half) and moves at half speed for the next hour (a successful saving throw does not negate the reduced speed).  7 Roh For the next 24 hours, the character suffers a -2 penalty on all skill and ability checks.  8 Seh The character is paralyzed for 2d12 hours, as with hold monster, except he cannot attempt new saving throws to overcome the effect.  9 Kog For the next week, the character emits a horrible smell. He suffers a -4 penalty on Diplomacy and Stealth checks.  10 Vis Once, during the next 24 hours, the character can reroll a single die roll he has just made and take the second result, as if using the good fortune ability from the Luck domain.  11 Fyeh The character gains 100 points of fire immunity, as if using protection from energy.  12 Xal The character gains the benefits of a heroism spell for the next 200 minutes.  13 Yaq For the next 24 hours, when the character hits a target he is flanking with a melee weapon, the attack does +1d6 points of precision damage.  14 Gib Once in the next 24 hours, the character can cast faerie fire (caster level equal to his character level). This ability is lost if the character rolls this result again with the knucklebone of fickle fortune before the 24 hours is concluded.  15 Xku The character is immune to fear for the next 24 hours.  16 Lev Once in the next 24 hours, the character can cast a lightning bolt (caster level equal to his character level). This ability is lost if the character rolls this result again with the knucklebone of fickle fortune before the 24 hours is concluded.  17 Nhi For the next 7 days, when the character is the target of healing magic, he heals an additional 2d8 hit points. This effect is lost if the character rolls the knucklebone of fickle fortune again before the 7 days are concluded.  18 Zmi For the next 24 hours, whenever the character succeeds on a saving throw against a harmful effect that does half damage or partial effect on a failed save, the knucklebone's character takes no damage or suffers no effect.  19 Tem For the next 24 hours, the character automatically confirms all critical hits.  20 Eha-Zah The next time the character dies, he comes back from the dead the very next morning as if the subject of a resurrection spell.

Should no Amatatsus of pure blood be able to take up that charge, however, the Amatatsu Seal can invest the right to rule as an Amatatsu in any number of living humanoid hosts. These Amatatsu scions often experience a series of visions of the past, present, and possible future.  The Amatatsu Seal has a daily allotment of 5 charges that it can use to cast the following spells on an Amatatsu scion: cure serious wounds, remove curse, remove disease, or restoration. Each casting uses up 1 daily charge. Alternatively, the seal can cast heal on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so expends all 5 charges. Finally, and only at the seal's discretion, it can cast resurrection on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so renders its spellcasting powers useless for a month.  The Amatatsu Seal itself radiates strong magic, and those with the proper resources can sense this magic across oceans and continents, allowing it to be tracked across any distance. Originally meant to allow its rightful owners the ability to track it if stolen, this feature makes it dangerous to remove the seal from its warding box, for as long as the warding box is open, the oni of the Five Storms can track it. The repercussions of this are detailed in later adventures in the Jade Regent Adventure Path.  One final ward exists on the Amatatsu Seal, confounding attempts to whisk it quickly away from its homeland but also making returning a stolen seal home an arduous task. The Amatatsu Seal can never be transported by teleportation magic or dimensional travel. It cannot be taken from the Material Plane save via special portals blessed by the gods, and characters who carry the seal cannot cast or otherwise use teleportation effects.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 49","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Amatatsu Seal","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"all schools"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"amatatsuSealArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265131,"modifiedTime":1677435299255,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

If a second command phrase is spoken (Her sheltering shield!) and a scooping motion is made with the chalice, a resilient sphere is created around the carrier. Each of these effects can be called upon twice per day.

At that point, the wearer and all living creatures within a 20-foot radius must succeed at a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid believing that they are actually some sort of undead creature for the next 24 hours. The GM can either roll randomly (1d6; 1-3 zombies, 4-5 ghouls, 6 vampires) or choose which sorts of specific undead the affected creatures believe themselves to be. Creatures affected by the armor behave as normal for the sorts of undead they regard themselves as-zombies mindlessly attack unassociated creatures near them, vampires attempt to bite victims on the neck, and so on-but gain none of the special abilities of that creature. The affected creatures react negatively to effects that harm their type of undead, so vampires avoid garlic, wraiths recoil from sunlight, and so on. The creatures continue to believe they are actually undead and ignore all evidence to the contrary. If attacked, they defend themselves, even if this requires using abilities they have but their type of undead normally lacks; for example, a barbarian who thinks she's a ghoul can still rage. Channel energy and other undead-affecting effects have no effect on creatures affected by gravesoul armor.  This is a mind-affecting, compulsion enchantment. The wearer of the armor can use this power up to three times per day, though it can only work on a particular creature once in any 24-hour period. Regardless of the curse, the armor is still +1 studded leather, and some characters may find it useful despite its (nonexistent) power over undead.

The Brazen Egg's inside has enough room to transport no more than eight Medium creatures, two Large creatures, or one Huge creature (as long as the Huge creature is squeezing). The egg has two methods in which it can move itself. The first is by a method similar to the dimension door spell, but the egg and all creatures within the egg are teleported. The second method is similar to the plane shift spell, though the egg can move to any plane it desires (it needs no focus) and when the egg plane shifts so do all creatures currently within it.   The egg has its own quirky, unabashed personality and can telepathically communicate with all creatures inside it or within 100 feet, regardless of language. The Brazen Egg's chief goal is to disrupt that plans of Hell's archdevils, but it requires the help of other creatures to do so. It often trades its ability to teleport and plane shift in order to gain such aid, but in dire circumstances it has the ability to enchant creatures in order to achieve its goals-and when it is close to reaching its goals it has little compunction in doing so. Once per day, the egg can affect a single creature within it as per the spell dominate person (though it is not limited to humanoids and can affect any living creature).

Geyser: If four or more levels' worth of spells are cast upon the Aqualinth, the artifact is capable of causing the water surrounding it to purify and multiply, generating thousands of gallons of water. At the same time, it creates an effect mimicking reverse gravity upon the water, causing it to shoot up in a geyser capable of reaching a thousand feet high.  Moments later, the effect passes; the water comes crashing down, and can be captured or diverted in the process, though the water level of the original supply remains unchanged.  Bath of the God-Kings: Bathing in a pool infested by the Aqualinth instantly refreshes the bather, removing any fatigued or exhausted conditions. In addition, the bather is treated as though he were wearing a ring of sustenance for the next 4 months. Regular bathing for 56 days results in a +1 increase to a single ability score of the bather's choice-a creature can receive this bonus only once, but can continue to receive the other benefits of bathing in the pool.

A duplicate can be distinguished from the original with a DC 30 Perception check, as the duplicate has a faint watery texture to its skin.

Baraket grants its wielder a +5 bonus on Bluff checks made to feint, so long as his opponent cannot see invisible items. Additionally, on a critical hit, the sword casts weird upon the target and all of that creature's allies within 30 feet.  The Swords of Sin were crafted to serve the runelords of Thassilon. In modern times, however, these runelords lie dead or dormant. With no lords to serve, the weapons of their champions lie dormant as well, reducing each to a +2 weapon that retains any special abilities detailed on page 469 of the Core Rulebook, but no other properties. The only way to awaken one of the blades is to restore its runelord master to active life or have some other legitimate ruler take up its master's mantle (the weapon determines what is considered legitimate). The swords can detect such restorations and flare to full power immediately, demanding their wielder seek out the restored runelord and swear eternal fealty.  Baraket woke for a few brief moments along with its master, then returned to dormancy as Xanderghul was murdered. Although Xanderghul was immediately reborn in a specially prepared simulacrum in the Temple of the Peacock Spirit, much of his power and presence was diminished by the trauma of death and rebirth. As a result, though Xanderghul is now technically active, Baraket remains dormant. Its link to Xanderghul exists, but only in a form akin to a hazy, partially remembered dream. If a character handles Baraket, the sword functions as dormant, but the character nonetheless has a distinct feeling of being watched from afar. In this adventure, handling the Sword of Sin without using the runewarded gauntlets should be unsettling but relatively safe. This does not remain the case in the next adventure, as Xanderghul's influence over the sword slowly grows.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 133","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Sword Of Pride, Baraket","cl":16,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"none"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"swordOfPrideBaraketArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265142,"modifiedTime":1677435299255,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The crown is powered by its wearer's paranoia and mistrust, using them to grant the wearer immunity to mind-affecting effects and divinations that gather information about him. The wearer can't lower this immunity without removing the crown. Donning a stannum crown saps the wearer's mind, imposing a -2 penalty to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.  Removing the crown negates the penalty, but the wearer's enhanced paranoia makes him unwilling to doff the headdress. He can try to remove the crown once per day by attempting a Will save (DC = 25 + the number of consecutive days the crown has been worn). Once the DC becomes 35 or higher, the wearer's paranoia has progressed to the point where he no longer treats any other creature as an ally and attempts saving throws against even harmless spells and abilities.

A simple cord allows the relic to be worn as a necklace. The jawbone represents all of Galevius's substantial powers of negotiation. The power of the artifact is not in the jaw, but in the 16 teeth socketed into the bone. Upon donning the jawbone, the wearer understands all of its powers and limitations. As a standard action, the wearer may remove a tooth from the jawbone and crush it in an open hand to activate its powers. The jawbone does not function for an evil character; an evil wearer finds the teeth rooted too firmly in the bone to remove.   When the Jawbone of the Venerable Galevius is first found, it contains a full set of 16 teeth. When a tooth is removed and crushed by the wearer, it provides the following effect for 1 hour, although an effect immediately ends if the wearer removes the jawbone or crushes another tooth.   Incisors (4 teeth): These teeth are used for cutting; in a negotiation, an incisor represents an attack on an opponent's position. Crushing an incisor grants a +4 sacred bonus on Intimidate checks and attack rolls.   Canines (2 teeth): Canines are used for tearing; in a negotiation, a canine represents a final, decisive strike in an argument. Crushing a canine grants a +4 sacred bonus on Diplomacy checks. In addition, whenever the user improves a creature's attitude with the Diplomacy skill, the creature's attitude automatically improves by an additional step (but does not exceed helpful).   Premolars (4 teeth): Premolars can perform multiple functions; in a negotiation, a premolar represents a careful shift of position. When crushed, a premolar grants a +4 sacred bonus on Bluff checks. In addition, the user does not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving.   Molars (6 teeth): These teeth are used for determined grinding; in a negotiation, a molar represents reasoned tenacity and persistence. Crushing a molar provides a +4 sacred bonus on Sense Motive checks and immunity to fatigue and exhaustion.   Despite the brittleness of the teeth socketed into the jawbone, the jawbone itself cannot be broken. Once all 16 teeth have been used, the empty jawbone immediately disappears, reappearing elsewhere in the world where a new owner is likely to encounter it. A prospective owner must be good-aligned and ideally has several ranks in Diplomacy.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 74","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Jawbone Of The Venerable Galevius","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"jawboneOfTheVenerableGaleviusArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"neck","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265154,"modifiedTime":1677435299256,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
{"_id":"ncLoMp1rLDbqZO7P","name":"Slime Tendril [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>A horrid, slimy whip crafted from a severed aboleth's tentacle, the slime tendril grants the wielder unpleasant transformative powers akin to those of the aboleths. The wielder of the slime tendril can breathe water as well as air, as if under a constant water breathing effect.  The slime tendril functions as a +3 quenchingUE scorpion whipUC. Three times per day as an immediate action, when the wielder damages a creature with the slime tendril, the wielder can force the creature to attempt a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw. Victims who fail this save are subjected to an aboleth's slime extraordinary ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 8).  Use of the slime tendril imparts a slow, terrible transformation upon the wielder. One day after the wielder first uses the slime tendril to affect another creature with the slime ability, the wielder's skin grows rubbery, increasing her natural armor bonus by 2. One week later, the wielder gains the aquatic subtype and the amphibious special quality, and she starts to experience strange dreams of cyclopean architecture in cavernous ocean trenches and a strong desire to live in the open ocean. If the wielder subsequently refrains from using the weapon's slime ability, these changes reverse after 1d4 months. Each time the wielder uses the weapon's slime ability during this time, she must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude saving throw or transform permanently into a skum, using the statistics on page 253 of the Bestiary in place of her own. This transformation cannot be reversed while the wielder carries the slime tendril, and a wish or a miracle is required to reverse it otherwise. A wielder transformed into a skum by the slime tendril has a soul-piercing longing for the ocean and takes 1d4 Wisdom drain each day she spends on dry land.  Aboleths within 10 miles of the slime tendril automatically become aware of the weapon's distance and direction, and they can use their dominate monster spell-like ability on the slime tendril's wielder as if the wielder were in the ability's normal range.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> 3 quenchingUE scorpion whip</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 122","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":4},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Slime Tendril","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"slimeTendrilArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265156,"modifiedTime":1677435299256,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
{"_id":"noTao9A2kh2BWmOq","name":"Scepter Of Ages [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The Scepter of Ages can be wielded as a +4 heavy mace with a critical threat range of 18-20. In addition to the damage this weapon deals, any creature struck by the scepter ages a number of years equal to the damage taken. On a critical hit, not only does the scepter deal greater damage, but the victim ages 2 years for every point of damage taken. Creatures aged in this manner might have their physical ability scores reduced; consult Table 7-2 on page 169 of the Core Rulebook for the effects of aging on common humanoids. For the wide range of unlisted humanoids and non-humanoids this aging might affect, GMs should use their judgment, general knowledge, and creature descriptions to decide how the effects of aging apply on a race-by-race basis. GMs looking for a quick way to approximate the ages of minor opponents should alter Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution by -1 for every 10 years aged and consider +40 years to be a creature's maximum age. Any creature aged to greater than its maximum age immediately dies. Constructs, outsiders, and undead are immune to the effects of aging. The mental abilities of those affected by this form of aging do not increase. Creatures that gain abilities dependant on their age gain these abilities as normal (though, at the GM's discretion, these abilities might not be immediately usable). The spell regenerate restores 1 year of premature aging for every hit point it heals. Creatures killed by aging can only be restored by true resurrection, miracle, or wish, but even these spells do not heal aging, returning the target to life only 1 year younger than his maximum age.  In addition to its use as a weapon, the Scepter of Ages can open a portal through time. To do this, the scepter's bearer must spend 10 minutes precisely aligning the delicate mechanisms within the artifact's head to the exact dates she wishes to travel to. This requires the bearer to make either a DC 30 Knowledge (history) check to program a precise date or a DC 30 Wisdom check to travel to a general period. The bearer can rush through calibrating the scepter, activating it in 1 minute, but doing so increases the associated DCs by +10. Regardless of whether or not this check is successful, a 5-foot-wide glowing tear in time opens within 15 feet. This rift cannot be used as a weapon or to destructive effect. What time the passage opens to is determined by whether the bearer succeeds at the check (opening a portal to the desired time) or fails (opening a portal to the incorrect time, determined by how significantly he failed, as shown on the Accidental Time Travel Results table on page 43). The time beyond the portal cannot be viewed and can only be discovered by passing completely through. The rift remains open for 1 minute before closing. What creatures or conditions lie beyond the portal are determined by the GM (see the Ages of Golarion table on page 43 for examples of different times on Golarion).<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +4 heavy mace</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Artifacts and Legends","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":8},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Scepter Of Ages","cl":25,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"scepterOfAgesArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265158,"modifiedTime":1677435299256,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
{"_id":"nsxQOCkYXGBetoqR","name":"Serithtial [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Serithtial is a +4 holy bastard sword crafted, it is said, by Iomedae herself as a gift to Mandraivus's great-grandfather, a man who led several crusades against Nidal. The sword was handed down through the generations, finally coming into the hands of a well-respected hero of Lastwall- Mandraivus. Serithtial was the perfect weapon for Mandraivus's assault on Scarwall, and some scholars of history now believe that Iomedae had foreseen its need and forged it early to ensure that Mandraivus not only would inherit it, but would respect its traditions all the more.  Although made of steel, Serithtial is treated as if made of both cold iron and silver for the purpose of penetrating damage reduction. Serithtial glows with the equivalent of a continual flame, but its wielder can extinguish or ignite this glow as a move action. In addition, it gains a further +2 enhancement bonus and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against foes who serve or worship Zon-Kuthon, as if it had the bane weapon special ability against such foes. This effect also functions against Queen Ileosa and those who directly serve her-including creatures like the dragon Zarmangarof (who serves her under magical compulsion) and the Red Mantis assassins (who serve as paid mercenaries). While Serithtial was forged as a bastard sword and reverts to this shape when no one wields it, when held in the hand, the sword immediately transforms into the type of blade its owner is most proficient with (choosing from dagger, short sword, longsword, scimitar, falchion, greatsword, rapier, or bastard sword-the GM can add additional sword-like weapons as she sees fit).  Serithtial can cast cure moderate wounds and zone of truth three times per day each, and usually reserves its healing power to use on its wielder when he is reduced to 1/4 his total hit points.  Serithtial's wielder gains the benefits of death ward and freedom of movement against attacks and effects generated by followers of Zon-Kuthon (and by extension, Queen Ileosa and her followers).  Although Serithtial is lawful good, as long as its wielder is dedicated to the defeat of Kazavon and those he has corrupted (such as Queen Ileosa), the sword does not attempt to seize control of its wielder. If its wielder does go against its wishes,  Serithtial tries to force him to relinquish the blade to a more appropriate wielder. As with all holy weapons, Serithtial imposes 1 negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the creature holds the weapon in its hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. A worshiper of Zon-Kuthon who wields Serithtial takes 4 negative levels and is nauseated as long as these negative levels persist. The negative levels and any additional side effects cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> +4 holy bastard sword</p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Curse Of The Crimson Throne Chapter Appendix","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":5},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Serithtial","cl":17,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"abjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"serithtialArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265160,"modifiedTime":1677435299256,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

It slowly sinks in fresh or salt water (unlike true ice, which floats), and while it creates a cocoon of ice around itself when submerged, it is only after several hours that this coating is thick enough to cause the staff to bob to the surface.

{"_id":"nzmUZYQY6LO0ZOI2","name":"Ring Of Equilibrium [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>A ring of equilibrium is a wooden ring carefully carved from core of an oak tree, decorated with delicate runes, and sanded and finished to be perfectly round, smooth, and symmetrical. When slipped on a finger, it sizes itself appropriately.   It's said the ring has a will of its own, but if it does, it evinces no obvious agenda. It favors wearers who possess strong personality traits-either those with strong morals, who exemplify goodness and honor, or those utterly devoid of morals, with the vilest and blackest souls imaginable. The ring especially favors mythic creatures, and often refuses to slip onto the finger of a creature that lacks strong personality traits or isn't mythic.   The ring has no special power over the living, but when its wearer dies or it's placed on the finger of a dead creature it deems worthy, the corpse and equipment of the wearer remain where they are but the ring vanishes entirely. Within 24 hours, a tree grows in a location that's as close as possible to where the wearer died. The next day, the tree splits along the middle, revealing a cavity where the wearer has been resurrected whole and uninjured, with the ring still adorning her finger. If the wearer died in an unsafe place, the tree appears as close to that location as possible while still being relatively safe for the wearer.   This rebirth comes at a price. The wearer receives certain knowledge that somewhere in the world, another being has been resurrected along with her-an individual of an opposite alignment who is every bit as wretched as the wearer is good, or vice versa. The opposite has roughly the same level and power as the wearer. The wearer has no knowledge of this other party whatsoever, other than that it exists and is free to do whatever it wishes-perpetrate any crime or perform any good deed- thanks to the wearer. This opposite is always brought back a considerable distance from the wearer. If the wearer dies again but the opposite doesn't, the wearer is resurrected again, along with another creature of an opposed nature. This cycle continues indefinitely until the ring is discarded or it moves on.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Mythic Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Ring Of Equilibrium","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"ringOfEquilibriumArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"ring","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265163,"modifiedTime":1677435299256,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Thereafter, the cursed doll considers that creature its owner. If the owner leaves the doll, it appears next to him the next time he sleeps.  The doll is vindictive. If the owner repeatedly tries to get rid of it or leaves it behind at home, it torments him with terrible nightmares in which everyone he trusts abandons him. If the owner destroys the doll, he has disturbing nightmares in which people he trusts murder him in gruesome ways. If the owner keeps the doll in a backpack or other closed container for much  of the day, he has nightmares in which he slowly suffocates in a dark, cramped place.  The nightmares occur the next time the owner sleeps. This functions as per nightmare (DC 22); the doll is considered to have firsthand knowledge of the owner (or familiar knowledge if the owner has owned the doll for more than a week) and to have a body part. Regardless of how the owner abandons or destroys the doll, it returns the next night in the same condition as when the owner first found it. Using break enchantment or remove curse on the doll makes it unable to return for 1d4+1 days, though at that point, it returns as usual.  The doll is quick to forgive, however. If the owner treats it well for a day, carrying it openly and maintaining physical contact, the nightmares fade away until the doll feels that it has been mistreated again. The only certain way to get rid of or destroy the doll (short of miracle or wish) is to find someone who accepts it as a gift. If the owner dies, the curse is lifted, and the doll patiently waits until a new owner finds it, though if the previous owner returns from the dead before that time, the doll returns to his side.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Horror Adventures","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Needful Doll","cl":13,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration and illusion"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"needfulDollCursed","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265171,"modifiedTime":1677435299257,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

{"_id":"pVIJUnXfdOIludRJ","name":"Dancing Hut Of Baba Yaga [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Approximately 15 feet tall and 15 feet square, this crude hut rises atop a pair of gigantic chicken legs that, when not tucked beneath the structure at rest, endlessly pick and scratch at the hut's surroundings. The lifelike legs aren't the only thing that make the hut remarkable, though. The small building's only door opens into a room more than twice the size of what the structure could naturally contain, but this remarkable space is but a threshold to places more wondrous still, for it is merely one possible configuration of countless extradimensional rooms (see page 23 for a map of this default layout of the hut's interior). Nothing that transpires outside the hut has any effect on those inside. The properties and abilities of the Dancing Hut are divided into two categories, the defensive and the transportive. Defensive: At its most basic level, the Dancing Hut is a unique CR 17 construct. The statistics and abilities of this remarkable creation are detailed on the following pages. A creature inside the hut can command the structure to move, attack, use its special abilities, or immediately perform any other function it is capable of by employing the Dancing Hut's unusual controls, which consist of a brown hen's egg inside a simple, cracked clay bowl sitting upon a table inside the hut. Both the bowl and egg can easily be removed or destroyed, but both reappear 1 hour later and only function within the confines of the hut. Breaking the egg reveals the head of live and very irate rooster that dies a long, squawking death-and disappears an hour later when the controls reform. Any creature that makes a successful DC 30 Use Magic Device check can use these innocuous controls to command the Dancing Hut. Failing this check causes the hut to dance erratically, potentially trampling creatures nearby, but has no effect on creatures inside the hut. A creature must succeed at a new Use Magic Device check every round to directly control the hut's actions. The hut can be assigned simple, standing commands to follow, such as to attack any humanoid that approaches, to patrol an area, to head in a direction for a set period, or to flee if damaged, but nothing complicated that requires it to follow multipart instructions, recognize specific individuals, or seek a specific place. Transportive: As a construct, the Dancing Hut can physically move on its own, but it also possesses the ability to slip between planes and even travel to other planets, carrying any inside the hut with it. This remarkable ability is activated using the cauldron within the hut, which links the hut to countless-if not infinite-locations across the planes. To use these transportive abilities, a creature must stand before the hut's cauldron, place two ingredients inside, and stir the everbubbling stew within-a process requiring a full-round action, though finding the desired ingredients might take longer. The two ingredients act as keys to a specific destination. Each destination the hut can travel to has a specific combination, or recipe, of two keys, which appear to be relatively normal items stored throughout the hut itself. Although the keys appear to be absolutely mundane, only those specific items within the hut function as keys. So while a red apple might be one key, it must be the red apple found inside the Dancing Hut, not just any apple. Like the hut's controls, keys can easily be destroyed or removed from the hut, but they reappear 1 hour later.  Once the proper keys have been placed in the cauldron, the Dancing Hut immediately appears at its new destination, as if it had traveled there via plane shift or interplanetary teleport (The Inner Sea World Guide). The hut always appears in the same location at a given destination-the keys are tied to that specific location at the destination. Once at a destination, the Dancing Hut can move (or be moved) to any other location on that world or plane normally. Once the hut arrives at its new destination, the keys immediately disappear from the cauldron, reforming elsewhere in the hut.  Each time a new combination of keys is used to transport the Dancing Hut to a new location, the interior layout of the hut changes, as each location the hut can travel to has its own corresponding layout of the hut's interior. The map on page 23 depicts a sample layout for the hut's interior, but as the hut travels, this layout can change dramatically, though every layout contains one room with a cauldron and the hut's controls, regardless of how many rooms are present in that layout.  When the hut's layout changes, the other layouts still exist, and are inaccessible from within the hut itself. Magic such as plane shift can still be used to visit these otherwise inaccessible layouts, and Baba Yaga herself (and perhaps some other residents of the hut as well) can freely travel throughout all of the rooms of the hut, regardless of the hut's physical location.  The table above presents a list of some of the best-known destinations the hut can travel to, along with the two keys needed to take the hut to that location. This list is by no means all-inclusive, and none-save perhaps Baba Yaga herself-know the limits of the hut's transportive properties.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Artifacts and Legends","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":3500},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Dancing Hut Of Baba Yaga","cl":30,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration and transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"dancingHutOfBabaYagaArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265177,"modifiedTime":1677435299257,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Each is an intelligent artifact largely in control of itself. A totem radiates an aura that forces all non-worshipers of Angazhan within 30 feet to make a successful DC 15 Will save or become panicked for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A totem can also make use of its own spell-like abilities as it pleases, frequently lashing out with weird to attack. Its size and direct connection to Angazhan's power prevents it from easily being used by other creatures. Any who would employ its powers must touch the totem. Those who aren't chaotic evil worshipers of Angazhan must also enter into a contest of wills with the totem to make use of its powers for that day (see page 535 of the Core Rulebook). If a creature wins the contest, that creature can direct the totem to use its abilities. Additionally, the creature is immune to the totem's panic aura for 24 hours and the totem cannot use its spell-like abilities against the creature for that day.  Once per day, a totem of Angazhan can reincarnate a single creature that dies within 30 feet of it. Unlike the spell of the same name, the reincarnated creature always returns to life as a chaotic evil charau-ka (The Inner Sea World Guide). A creature reincarnated as a charau-ka gains +4 Str, +2 Dex, and +4 Con. Once per year, the totem may instead use its reincarnate ability to bring a creature back to life as a chaotic evil dire ape-it is this ability that creates the creatures that go on to become Gorilla Kings. A creature reincarnated as a dire ape gains +8 Str, +4 Dex, and +6 Con. When a new dire ape champion is created, it becomes infused with a desire to seek out the current Gorilla King and challenge him to a fight to the death-the survivor rules as the Gorilla King for another year. As with all reincarnate effects, the creature being restored to life must be willing for the effect to work-the creature to be reincarnated knows that accepting  the offer to come back to life enslaves its soul to Angazhan (resulting in the shift to chaotic evil and the drive to seek out and replace the current Gorilla King).  If a totem of Angazhan is placed upon or adjacent to an altar of Angazhan that is under the effect of an unhallow spell cast by a worshiper of Angazhan, the totem of Angazhan's sensory range extends to 300 feet, and it can use its abilities in this extended range as long as it has line of sight to its target.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Artifacts and Legends","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":150},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Totem Of Angazhan","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"necromancy and transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"totemOfAngazhanArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265178,"modifiedTime":1677435299257,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

If placed upon the arm of a non-mythic character, the graft instead devours the limb, dealing 5d6 points of damage and amputating the arm.   Once attached, the glabrezu claw surrounds its wearer with a field of force. This provides a deflection bonus to AC equal to the wearer's mythic tier.

The demon lord emerged fully formed, and the crafting of this weapon was among the first of his acts-Riftcarver aided the demon lord tremendously in those first few thousand centuries of his life, and was the primary tool he used to dig the Rasping Rifts.  Riftcarver is a Gargantuan +5 defending unholy wounding scythe. As part of its first successful hit against a target in any one round, Riftcarver can infest the creature hit with rot grubs (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 245). Once per minute as a standard action by striking at the ground, Riftcarver can create an earthquake centered on the target's location. Riftcarver's wielder never suffers any ill effects from earthquakes created by the scythe. Once per day, the scythe can be swept through the air as a standard action to rip a hole between worlds that serves as a 20-foot-diameter gate-this gate can be used only for planar travel, not for calling creatures. Riftcarver is made of the chitin of an Abyssal monster, yet it is treated as adamantine for the purposes of damaging objects and penetrating hardness.  Smaller versions of this artifact, built to be used by Medium cultists, also exist. Called rotcarvers, the majority of these weapons have been captured and destroyed by the crusaders by the Fifth Crusade.

The wearer must eat and drink a full day's worth of food and water each hour to avoid making a starvation or thirst check. Once the wearer starts to take lethal damage instead of nonlethal damage due to failed checks, he begins to experience ever more powerful cravings for the flesh of intelligent creatures (any living creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher).   Once the wearer feasts in such a manner, he recovers all nonlethal damage sustained from hunger and thirst, though he continues to suffer lethal damage on failed starvation and thirst checks. The next time he is in a situation in which he could eat part of an intelligent being, he must make a DC 15 Will save or dine on the forbidden meat. If the wearer succumbs to this urge again, he recovers all lethal damage from failed starvation and thirst checks, and realizes cannibalism is the key to avoiding the increased hunger and thirst-on any day he eats at least one meal of flesh from an intelligent creature, he does not have to make hourly starvation and thirst checks, and recovers any accumulated damage from failing these checks.

{"_id":"sUHTVVXGoXwjaTDv","name":"Omat's Sarcophagus [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Omat's Sarcophagus is similar in appearance to the sarcophagi used in the burial rites of many ancient pharaohs. It is constructed from wood, and its surface is sealed with pitch and set with an alternating pattern of scaled bands carved from lapis lazuli and jasper and scribed with thousands of protective hieroglyphs. All other exposed surfaces are gilded. Although this item appears to be a normal sarcophagus, it has a number of special powers. Each of these effects can be used once per day, and they affect only creatures of the humanoid type.  If a humanoid that has been dead for less than 1 month is placed inside Omat's Sarcophagus and the lid is sealed, the corpse's soul is forced into the sarcophagus and trapped there. The corpse then disintegrates and the sarcophagus begins building a new young-adult body over the course of 2d12 days. This effect occurs even if the original creature had reached the end of its natural life. The body created is free of all physical ills and afflictions that the creature may have previously suffered. Once the new body is complete, the soul is then forced into the new body and the being awakens in the sarcophagus. If the sarcophagus is destroyed before the soul can be united with the newly formed body, the soul is once again released to the afterlife.  If a living creature is placed inside Omat's Sarcophagus, it can use the device to travel to the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, or Pharasma's Boneyard. To activate this teleportation power, a creature must be inside the sarcophagus with the lid closed. The user must then recite aloud the sacred poem of Neb-Aku (which is inscribed on the interior of the sarcophagus's lid) in Ancient Osiriani. The recitation immediately opens a portal, and the user can then move through the portal to the desired plane (chosen after reciting the poem). The sarcophagus doesn't confer any abilities that protect the user while on another plane. For up to 48 hours after using Omat's Sarcophagus to travel to another plane, the user can utter a command word to be immediately transported back to the sarcophagus. After this time passes, the user must find her own way back to the Material Plane.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 83","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1500},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Omat's Sarcophagus","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"omatsSarcophagusArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265195,"modifiedTime":1677435299258,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The demonic chapters of the Book of the Damned are bound between razor-edged covers of cold iron.  Care must be taken when opening this book, lest the covers cut the fingers. Blood spattered on the pages of the book quickly fades away, as if the damp sheets of pale parchment within possessed a thirsty, vampiric nature. A DC 12 Reflex save is enough to avoid being cut when opening this book-on a failed save, the user takes 2 points of Constitution damage.  This section of the Book of the Damned serves as a catalogue of the Abyssal realms and their lords-yet just as the rulers of the Abyss wax and wane, the contents of this book shift and change as well, revealing dark secrets.  Any good-aligned creature who touches this section of the Book of the Damned gains one negative level.  This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Creatures attempting to read the book that are not chaotic evil must make a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward chaotic evil.  These pages of the Book of the Damned are written in Abyssal. A reader who spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as all of the arcane spells listed below. The user gains a +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks if she uses the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of the Abyss are so accurate that any teleportation travel to or within the Abyss always brings the caster to the exact location desired.  The demonic section of the Book of the Damned serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy tuned to attract chaotic evil creatures. As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all evil spells as if she were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with chaotic evil creatures.  Three times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, desecrate, greater planar binding, insanity, rift of ruin (see page 48), summon monster VII, or unholy blight. Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can use the book to gain any one of the boons granted by any demon lord-the boon lasts as long as the owner retains possession of the book, or until she chooses a new boon.

The bearer of an Orb can, as a standard action, dominate a dragon of its particular variety within 500 feet (as dominate monster), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. Spell resistance is not useful against this effect. Each Orb of Dragonkind bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the Orb. A character possessing an Orb of Dragonkind is immune to the breath weapon-but only the breath weapon-of the dragon variety keyed to the Orb. Finally, a character possessing an Orb can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the Orb three times per day.   All Orbs of Dragonkind can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other Orbs. The owner of an Orb knows if there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the Orb's particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the Orb's variety, the wielder can determine the dragon's exact location and age. The bearer of one of these Orbs earns the enmity of dragonkind forever for profiting by draconic enslavement, even if she later loses the item. Each Orb also has an individual power that can be invoked once per round at caster level 10th.   • Black Dragon Orb: Fly.   • Blue Dragon Orb: Haste.   • Brass Dragon Orb: Teleport.   • Bronze Dragon Orb: Scrying (Will DC 18 negates).   • Copper Dragon Orb: Suggestion (Will DC 17 negates).   • Gold Dragon Orb: The owner of the gold Orb can call upon any power possessed by one of the other Orbs-including the dominate and breath weapon abilities but not AC, save bonuses, or breath weapon immunity-but can use an individual power only once per day.

A wheel of worlds appears as a spherical astrolabe the size of a human skull. Rings of bronze, dark adamantine, and steel form a shifting shell, and as each band moves it reveals another below. These rings bear spidery symbols, marking and measuring the location of celestial bodies. Many researchers who obsess over these devices claim that within their shells lies the truth of the heavens and beyond. Most realize too late, however, that the truth they seek is not one any mortal should know.  A wheel of worlds creates gates to other planes. Using it causes a portal to open to a random plane for 1 minute (roll on the table below to determine the destination). The portal is not transparent, thus preventing a view of the plane beyond, though the artifact's user is given an impression of what lies beyond. The user can then either travel to that plane or call through a creature native to that realm. Doing either immediately closes the gate. If the bearer wishes, she can attempt to open a portal to a specific plane by manipulating the rings of the artifact, a complex series of adjustments requiring a successful DC 25 Wisdom check. Failing such a check by 5 or less still results in a destination determined by a random roll on the table, but the artifact's user can select whether the destination is that plane or the next or previous plane listed on the table, exerting some influence over the gate.  Within a wheel of worlds lies a trap. Every time a wielder uses the astrolabe, its rings collapse and reveal stranger, more profane markings within. The GM should track each use of the artifact. After every portal opened, there is a cumulative 1% chance that next time the portal is used it opens not to the randomly generated plane, but to the corresponding layer of Hell noted on the chart. Every attempt to manipulate the artifact to reach a specific plane (whether successful or not) increases this chance by 3%. When the Wheel of Worlds unexpectedly opens to Hell, the wielder is given a wrong impression of the plane beyond, believing the gate has opened to the expected plane (or to a different layer of Hell, if Hell was the expected plane) rather than to the actual layer of Hell. If she attempts to summon a creature through the gate that is not a native of Hell, a random devil is conjured. This devil is not under the user's control and attempts to destroy the summoner. Every creature that uses a wheel of worlds has its own percent chance of this diabolical malfunction, which can never be reduced. Should a creature ever reach a 100% chance of opening a gate to a layer of Hell, a wheel of worlds instantly shifts both itself and its wielder to a random layer of Hell upon its next use.   d10 Plane Layer of Hell  1 The Abyss Avernus  2 The Maelstrom Dis  3 Axis Erebus  4 Nirvana Phlegethon  5 Elysium Stygia  6 Heaven Malebolge  7 The Boneyard Cocytus  8 Abaddon Caina  9 Hell Nessus  10 Roll again Roll again<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Book of the Damned","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":10},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Wheel Of Worlds","cl":25,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration [evil lawful]"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"wheelOfWorldsArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265202,"modifiedTime":1677435299259,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Its surface is carved with an intricate pattern of interlocking knots inlaid with silver and copper. When sounded, the horn can drive off or attract dragons of all varieties. Lesser dragons such as drakes typically flee in terror from the sound of the Drakesbane Horn, while more powerful dragons are compelled to seek out the horn. Creatures must be able to hear the horn to be affected by it.  The Drakesbane Horn affects dragons based on their CR, as detailed below.  Creatures of the dragon type of CR 5 or less within 400 feet must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or be affected as if by scare (no HD limit).  Creatures of the dragon type of CR 6 to CR 10 within 400 feet must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be affected as if by sympathy.  Adult or older true dragons and creatures of the dragon type of CR 11 or greater are immune to the horn's effects, though they are likely to seek out the horn and attack its bearer.  If the character playing the horn has the bardic performance class feature or the raging song class feature and succeeds at a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, dragons of CR 5 or less are instead affected by fear (Will DC 16), while dragons of CR 6 to CR 10 affected by the horn's sympathy effect must succeed at an additional Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the character's level + the character's Charisma modifier) or also be fascinated for as long as the character continues to play the horn.  A creature that successfully saves against the horn's effects is immune to further blasts for the next 24 hours.

The silver-and-gold frame is equally elegant and etched with faintly glowing arcane symbols.  The painting is a powerful minor artifact that can be used to create one or more duplicates of any living creature that has a Charisma score of at least 10. By touching the painting and uttering a command word, the subject creature is drawn into the painting and appears seated in the chair. The subject is under the effects of a binding spell.  Delving into the subconscious mind, the painting creates a duplicate of the subject that lasts for 1 day per Hit Die the creature possesses. If the subject creature has a positive Charisma modifier, additional duplicates equal to its Charisma modifier may be created. Each of these duplicates represents an alter ego of the subject. Some beings may have multiple alter egos. In this case, the subject creature determines exactly how many id duplicates he wants the id portrait to create, up to a maximum determined by his Charisma modifier.  An id duplicate can be of a different class from the subject creature, and it has average hit points for that class, the same number of Hit Dice as the subject creature, and the same basic knowledge and goals as the subject creature (modified by any ability score changes). It is an average member of its class, with appropriate skills and feats. Reallocate the subject creature's ability scores to make them appropriate to the new class chosen.  A duplicate can carry out whatever tasks the original creature desires. If all duplicates are destroyed, the original creature is ejected from the id portrait and permanently loses 1 point of Charisma (this cannot be replaced by any means short of a miracle or wish). In addition, he is under the effects of slow and dimensional anchor for the following 24 hours. These effects cannot be dispelled. The portrait is usually placed somewhere hidden and safe, or in the care of trusted guardians, since the subject creature is significantly weakened until he recovers from the magical effects. When a duplicate has lived out its allotted time, it simply dies. Even if the duplicate is slain or dies before its duration expires, the body remains and behaves as a normal corpse. Spells such as miracle, raise dead, and resurrection fail to affect a duplicate corpse created by the id portrait.

It is engraved with delicate runes around the bottom lip, and measures 3 feet from lip to crown and 5 feet in circumference around the bottom. Sacred to the faith of Desna, seven such bells are believed to have existed at one point, each housed in a separate tower throughout the Inner Sea region. While these seven bell towers were separated by great distance, they represented the Seven Towers of Desna's palace, and pilgrimages to all seven were often undertaken by her faithful. Six towers are located in the western Mierani Forest of Varisia, the Hungry Mountains of Ustalav, the ruined city of Kokutang in the Sodden Lands, the eastern reaches of Tanglebriar in Kyonin, a hidden cove on Warlock Island in Cheliax, and somewhere in the hills south of White Canyon in Katapesh-over time, some of these locations have become quite dangerous. Each location presents its own dangers, and in some cases the bells themselves have gone missing. The seventh bell still hangs in its tower in an old fort in the eastern Stonewilds of the Worldwound.   A Bell of Mercy's magic works only once per year, though it can be rung more often as a normal bell. When activated, the bell sanctifies the area around it with the effects of hallow with a 120-foot radius, and with the additional effects of protection from evil for every good-aligned creature within the area. Within a 60-foot radius, this also includes a chaotic good maximized forbiddance effect. Creatures whose alignments are not chaotic or not good take 36 points of damage (Will DC 19 half) upon entering this area, while creatures whose alignments are neither chaotic nor good take 72 points of damage. All evil extraplanar creature within 60 feet when the bell is rung must succeed at DC 20 Will save or be banished to their plane of origin-evil outsiders who resist this are still staggered in this area as a result of the bell's power. Finally, the immediate structure surrounding the bell becomes infused with magic, causing doors and walls within its forbiddance area to be magically treated (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 411) and repairing damage at the rate of 5 points of damage per round. These repairs cannot repair damage to a structure incurred before the bell was rung. A Bell of Mercy is constantly under the effect of a dimensional lock, so it cannot be transported via teleportation.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 75","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2000},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Bell Of Mercy","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"abjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"bellOfMercyArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265219,"modifiedTime":1677435299260,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

A single dose of sun orchid elixir cannot stop the aging process, but it does the next-best thing-it restores youth. A creature that drinks the elixir is restored to its starting age as a young adult. The drinker's new age is randomly determined using Table 7-1 on page 169 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. All penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution the drinker may have suffered as a result of advanced age are removed, but all bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma that result from advanced age remain (although as the character ages again into middle age and beyond, he does not gain any of these bonuses a second time).  Vanity-seekers go to nearly any length to acquire the elixir, resorting to bribery, extortion, and murder. To curtail such troubles in the land of its creation, the use of the elixir is outlawed in Thuvia (except by the formula's creator). Each vial of sun orchid elixir requires six mature sun orchids and 1 month's time to ferment, although the exact formula used is a secret known only to the denizen of Alchemist's Keep in Thuvia.

Drawing on the power of a bound infernal duke, such a talisman encourages its wearer to perform feats of selfish glory and  indulge in grand delusions, which culminate in the release of the talisman's power and damnation for both the wearer and those unfortunate enough to be caught in his wake. Bilious talismans are minor artifacts requiring the binding of a willing member of the infernal elite and thus can be crafted only by a supremely powerful diabolist or unique devil.  All bilious talismans are intelligent magical items with an Ego of 20 that grant their wearers a +4 Charisma bonus and the effects of the spell foresight. In addition, once per day the wearer can call on the bound devil as a free action to gain the effects of commune, find the path, legend lore, or true strike. The devil within the talisman usually subtly portrays itself as a benevolent spirit seeking to aid the wearer in achieving some great feat, such as vanquishing a great evil, bringing peace to a land, or ruling a kingdom. The talisman ever seeks to increase its wearer's influence, even that of a wearer with an alignment opposed to its own, planting the seed of corruption in the form of arrogance, avarice, and a sense of predestination.  When the wearer finally reaches what the talisman deems his pinnacle of power, surrounded by followers and fawning devotees, the talisman offers to reveal its greatest power as a reward to its wearer. Should the wearer accept, he and all creatures, lands, and objects within 1,000 feet are ripped from whatever plane they occupy and transported physically to a random layer of Hell to remain there forever. There, the talisman shatters and the unique devil within is released. What follows is often a massive slaughter and the damnation of dozens or even hundreds of souls. Should the wearer reject the offer, the talisman attempts to use its Ego score to dominate him and force him to accept. If the talisman ever faces destruction, it can use teleport on itself once per day-though it is prevented from doing this in areas affected by the hallow spell or similar areas of great goodness (or areas that bar dimensional travel, such as ones affected by dimensional lock or forbiddance).  Each bilious talisman has a unique devil bound within. For example, a bilious talisman could contain a powerful pit fiend named Aasdravox who speaks with a voice like grinding stones and tells the wearers of his talisman that they are destined to become great heroes and champions, beloved by whole nations. Optimally, he seeks to release his power at the culmination of a festival or ceremony held in his talisman wearer's honor.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Book of the Damned","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Bilious Talisman","cl":21,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"conjuration"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"biliousTalismanArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"neck","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265225,"modifiedTime":1677435299260,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

{"_id":"vh4yugQ9xXnx25Ft","name":"The Dreamstone [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The dreamstone's primary function is to surround itself with a stable dreamscape within the Dimension of Dreams. The dreamstone's radius is fluid and ever-expanding when the artifact is awakened, overlaying both the Material and Ethereal Planes, though it is held in check by any significant bodies of water, such as rivers or seas. The nature of the dream realm changes within this radius, creating a communally shared dreamscape that distortedly reflects the features of the Material Plane. Its power shifts the Dimension of Dreams' properties to alterable morphic and normal magic planar traits.  Dreamers who fall asleep within planes affected by the dreamstone's influence do not create their own ephemeral demiplanes, but rather appear randomly within the dreamstone's stabilized dreamscape. Those who experience deadly nightmares are affected differently in the dreamstone's realm. Normal dreamers killed in the dreamscape wake up exhausted, while lucid dreamers whose lucid bodies perish also die in the waking world. Lucid dreamers can still make attempts to alter the dreamscape's reality with Charisma checks, just as in their own personal dreamscapes, but the DC increases by 5. Spell slots and magic item charges used by lucid dreamers in the dreamstone's dreamscape are also consumed in the real world. A person falling asleep in the dreamstone's radius has a 10% chance of experiencing a lucid dream.  The dreamscape holds other dangers. Regardless of the lucidity of their dreaming body, each dreamer must make a successful saving throw each night or be set upon by the realm's dark presences, affecting the dreamer as a nightmare spell. This effect initially requires a DC 15 Will save, but dreamers begin with a +10 Will save modifier due to the dreamstone's lack of familiarity with them as a target. On each subsequent visit, the dreamstone becomes more aware of its demiplane's visitors, and its familiarity with dreamers grows after every 15 visits, increasing the DC by 5 (removing the +10 Will save modifier after the first increase).  When a creature dies within the stabilized dreamscape, whether due to the perils of lucid dreaming or the dreamstone's nightmare effect, the dreamstone's radius spreads 1 foot for each of that creature's Hit Dice. Close proximity to the dreamstone is also hazardous, and the stone radiates a vision of HellUM effect (Will DC 20 negates) out to 50 feet that reflects the terror and destruction it was destined to inflict as it fell to Golarion. Ancient tomes such as the Paginarum Lethargica t heorize t hat o nce the dreamstone's boundaries reach a certain threshold, it can overcome bodies of water, and all within will be consumed in a fiery cataclysm, fulfilling the predictions of its visions.

{"_id":"vjJ2QBGSWlZGjhIj","name":"Sihedron [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The Sihedron is a seven-pointed star that symbolizes the great power of Thassilonian magic. Xin created the Sihedron as more than just a symbol of his power over the schools of magic he'd defined for his nation, though. It was initially meant to be a badge of his power over all of Thassilon and a symbol of the unified nature of the nation's peoples. Each of the Sihedron's arms is made of a different skymetal, symbolizing how the nation of Thassilon was made of different races-Azlanti, Varisian, Shoanti, giant, elf, and others. Xin went further than merely making the Sihedron a symbol of harmony and diversity, though, and built into it significant advantages when the artifact is shared among a number of allies. The powers granted by the Sihedron are greatest when it is used not by a lone individual, but by a group that works together toward a common goal and whose members trust each other enough to effortlessly pass control of the powerful item between themselves swiftly and without a second thought.  Alas, Xin's ideals for the diversity of Thassilon were misplaced, and even as his rule continued, he found himself increasingly paranoid and unwilling to share the powers granted by the Sihedron. The fact that the item was intended to be a powerful shared artifact but has never properly been used in this manner is one of the greatest ironies of Thassilon.  The Sihedron itself is a relatively plain-looking item. The seven different hues of its composite metals give it some color, but the artifact lacks any of the decorative runes and markings that are so common on other Thassilonian artifacts. Even the artifact itself, built in the image of the sign of Lissala and the rune for the Thassilonian schools  of magic, seems somewhat plain, lacking the distinctive hooklike shapes along the Sihedron rune's arms. Instead, these hooks are represented in the device by seven ioun stones embedded on the arms.  To activate the Sihedron, a person needs only to touch the center of the star where all seven arms meet and concentrate as a swift action-the Sihedron then immediately rises up into the air behind the user's head like a halo and floats along behind him wherever he goes, even teleporting along with him. Although the Sihedron is not in physical contact with the user, it is in all ways treated as if it were an attended object being held or carried. Once activated, the Sihedron glows with a warm yellow light that sheds illumination as per a daylight spell. It implants knowledge of all its powers and how to activate them into the mind of anyone who activates it in this way.  Once activated, the Sihedron protects its user in a number of ways. First, it constantly infuses the wearer with magical energy, granting him fast healing 5. Second, it grants the user the constant effects of a foresight spell (providing a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves, and preventing the user from being surprised or flat-footed). Third, up to once per day, the Sihedron can target its bearer with true resurrection the instant he is slain-he need not activate this power, as the Sihedron automatically triggers if the user is killed.  When the user activates the Sihedron, he must select one of the star's points to be ascendant, causing the Sihedron to rotate so that this point is oriented straight upward. The user immediately gains an additional defensive ability and an at-will spell-like ability, as detailed below. Each point is opposed by two other points; the user can change which point is ascendant by concentrating as a standard action, but he cannot change the point to an opposing point. The effects granted by each of the Sihedron's points (as well as the two opposing points for each) are listed at the end of this item description.  As an immediate action (but no more than once per combat round), the current user of the Sihedron can instantaneously transfer the artifact to another willing creature within 120 feet. The Sihedron teleports from the current user and appears behind the head of the target creature. As it does so, it unleashes a surge of potent magic that affects both creatures, granting a +2 insight bonus on saving throws for 1 round and restoring 2d8+10 points of damage for each creature. This transfer occurs so quickly that it can grant the bonus on a saving throw after the saving throw itself has been rolled, but the transfer must be made before the outcome of that roll is announced by the GM. Likewise, the healing granted can occur in the instant before a creature takes damage from any source, possibly healing a heavily wounded target before additional damage renders it unconscious or even kills it. When the  Sihedron is granted to a new target in this manner, the new target can automatically select which point of the Sihedron is ascendant, even if that point is oppositional to the previously ascendant point.  Each of the Sihedron's arms contains an ioun stone embedded in a small receptacle. These ioun stones cannot be removed as long as the Sihedron is whole, and they help to power the following additional abilities when one of the points is ascendant.  Charity: Grants a +4 insight bonus to AC and dimensional anchor as a spell-like ability. Opposed by both kindness and temperance.  Generosity: Grants a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls and beast shape II as a spell-like ability. Opposed by humility and love.  Humility: Grants a +8 insight bonus on skill checks and greater invisibility as a spell-like ability. Opposed by generosity and zeal.  Kindness: Grants a +4 insight bonus on weapon damage rolls and ice storm as a spell-like ability. Opposed by charity and zeal.  Love: Grants a +8 insight bonus on initiative checks and charm monster as a spell-like ability. Opposed by generosity and temperance.  Temperance: Grants fast healing 10 (this replaces the standard fast healing granted by the Sihedron) and fear as a spell-like ability. Opposed by charity and love.  Zeal: Grants a +8 insight bonus on concentration and caster level checks and dimension door as a spell-like ability.

For most, this means an excruciating, spell-blasted death; for a small fraction of others, this means a typically brief but painful existence as a failed lich; but for an exceedingly rare few, this means something in between. A phylactery of the failed has a minute chance of coming into being anytime a spellcaster attempts to achieve lichdom and fails (equivalent to 1 in 100). In such cases, the magic-user's body is destroyed, but the phylactery he prepared remains and is invested with a remnant of his shattered consciousness. The creature that opens a phylactery of the failed must immediately succeed at a DC 30 Will saving throw or be affected by a disease-like curse known as a parasitic soul (detailed below). Those affected by a parasitic soul have their own personality and sanity overwhelmed by the remnant ambitions and memories of the would-be lich whose destruction created the phylactery. If the cursed creature is killed by the parasitic soul, her body is animated 1 day later as a lich with the same memories and abilities of the magic-user who created the phylactery, essentially allowing that spellcaster to finally achieve lichdom. The cursed creature cannot be returned to life until the lich is destroyed.  If the parasitic soul is excised from a victim, it returns to the phylactery and attempts to infect the next creature to open the box. The parasitic soul can only infect one creature at a time. While a creature is infected by a parasitic soul, the phylactery the soul is bound to has no dangerous properties and cannot infect other creatures.  The invasive nature of phylacteries of the failed has spawned the creation of several other pernicious magic items, such as the disease-spreading death's head coffer (see Pathfinder Adventure Path #8).  Parasitic Soul Curse and disease; save Will DC 30; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Intelligence damage; cure a parasitic soul can only be cured by casting both a spell that prevents the target from being mentally controlled (like protection from evil) and remove curse.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Artifacts and Legends","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":5},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Phylactery Of The Failed","cl":18,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"necromancy [evil]"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"phylacteryOfTheFailedArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265230,"modifiedTime":1677435299261,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Each day at sunrise, the gem rotates to display a different facet. The active facet determines the ring's power for that day. Each day, roll 1d10 on the Ring of Nine Facets Powers table to determine which facet-and thus which power-is active.  The wearer of the ring can, with a great deal of mental exertion, attempt to change the active facet away from one she does not desire. The gem can only be turned in a particular order that shifts the active facet to the next highest facet, and each facet is a particular number of steps away from one another (see the Ring of Nine Facets Powers table). To change the facet, the wearer must succeed at a Wisdom check as a full-round action, and the wearer takes nonlethal damage, regardless of success. The DC of the Wisdom check to turn the gem is 15 + 5 per 1-step increase, while the nonlethal damage dealt equals 1d6 per 1-step increase. For example, if the facet of the day were yellow, the wearer could attempt a DC 20 Wisdom check and take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage to shift it to copper, or attempt a DC 25 Wisdom check and take 2d6 points of nonlethal damage to shift it to green. The ring's facets cannot be shifted backwards (thus, yellow cannot turn directly to white; it must shift through all seven other colors to reach white). The ring's facet can only be changed once per day.  Any nongood creature that wears the Ring of Nine Facets immediately takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and another 2d6 points of nonlethal damage every minute it continues to wear the ring.   1d10/Step Facet Color Active Facet Power  1 Green Wearer is immune to disease  2 Indigo Wearer needs no air to survive  3 Orange Wearer gains a +5 natural armor bonus  4 Violet Wearer gains low-light vision  5 Red Wearer gains fast healing 1  6 Blue Wearer can use fly at will  7 White Wearer gains cold resistance 30  8 Yellow Wearer gains freedom of movement  9 Copper Wearer gains a +5 resistance bonus on saving throws  10* Roll again.  * This step does not count as a facet for the purposes of adjusting the ring's daily ability.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Artifacts and Legends","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Ring Of Nine Facets","cl":19,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"abjuration conjuration and transmutation"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"ringOfNineFacetsArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"ring","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265233,"modifiedTime":1677435299261,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

{"_id":"wZ6XFa1igvhu4JrI","name":"Sihedron [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The Sihedron is a seven-pointed star that symbolizes the power of Thassilonian magic. Xin created the Sihedron as more than just a symbol of his power over the schools of magic he'd defined for his nation, though. It was initially meant to be a badge of his power over all of Thassilon, and a symbol of the unified nature of the nation's peoples. Each of the Sihedron's arms is made of a different skymetal, symbolizing how the nation of Thassilon was made of different races-Azlanti, Varisian, Shoanti, giant, elf, and others. Xin went further than merely making the Sihedron a symbol of harmony and diversity, though, and built into its functionality significant advantages when the artifact is shared among a number of allies. The powers granted by the Sihedron are greatest when it is used not by a lone individual, but by a group that works together toward a common goal, and whose members trust each other enough to effortlessly pass control of the powerful item between themselves swiftly and without a second thought.  Alas, Xin's ideals for the diversity of Thassilon were misplaced, and even as his rule continued, he found himself increasingly paranoid and unwilling to share the powers granted by the Sihedron. The fact that the item was intended to be a powerful shared artifact but has never properly been used in this manner is one of the greatest ironies of Thassilon.  The Sihedron itself is a relatively plain-looking item. The seven different hues of its composite metals help to give it some color, but the artifact lacks any of the decorative runes and markings that are so common on other Thassilonian artifacts. Even the artifact itself, built in the image of the sign of Lissala and the rune for the Thassilonian schools of magic, seems somewhat plain, lacking the Sihedron rune's distinctive hooklike shapes along its arms. In fact, these hooks are represented in the device by the placement of the seven ioun stone receptacles.  Once the Sihedron is activated, it glows with a warm yellow light that sheds illumination as if via a daylight spell. To activate the Sihedron, a person need only touch the center of the star where all seven arms meet and concentrate as a swift action-the Sihedron immediately rises up into the air behind the user's head like a halo and floats along behind him wherever he goes, even teleporting along with him. Although the Sihedron is not in physical contact with the user, it is in all ways treated as if it were an attended object being held or carried. The Sihedron implants knowledge of all its powers and how to activate them into the mind of anyone who activates it in this way.  Once activated, the Sihedron protects its user in a number of ways. First, it constantly infuses the wearer with magical energy, granting him fast healing 5. Second, it grants the user the constant effects of a foresight spell (providing a +2 insight bonus to AC and on Reflex saves, and preventing the user from ever being surprised or flat-footed). Third, up to once per day, the Sihedron can target its wearer with true resurrection the instant he is slain-he need not activate this power, as the Sihedron automatically triggers if the user is killed.  When the user activates the Sihedron, he may select one of the star's points to be ascendant. The Sihedron rotates so that this point is pointing upward, and he immediately gains an additional defense and the use of a spell-like ability, usable at will, as detailed below. The user may change which point is ascendant as a standard action by concentrating, but cannot change the point to an oppositional point. The effects granted by each of the Sihedron's points (as well as the two oppositional points for each) are listed at the end of this item description.  As an immediate action (but no more often than once during any single combat round), the current user of the Sihedron may cause the artifact to instantaneously transfer itself to another willing creature within 120 feet. The Sihedron teleports from the current user and appears behind the head of the target creature. As it does so, it unleashes a surge of potent magic that affects both of these creatures, granting a +2 insight bonus on all saving throws for 1 round and healing each creature of 2d8+10 points of damage. This transfer occurs so quickly that it can grant the bonus on a saving throw after the saving throw itself has been rolled, but it must be made before the result of that role is confirmed by the GM. Likewise, the healing granted can occur in the instant before a creature actually takes damage from any source, which could heal a heavily wounded target before the additional damage renders it unconscious or even kills it. When the Sihedron is granted to a new target in this manner, the new target can automatically select which point of the Sihedron is ascendant, even if the point selected is oppositional to the previously active point.  Each of the Sihedron's arms contains an ioun stone embedded in a small receptacle. These ioun stones cannot be removed as long as the Sihedron is whole, and they help to power the following additional abilities when one of the points is ascendant.  Charity: Grants a +4 insight bonus to AC and dimensional anchor as a spell-like ability. Opposed by kindness and temperance.  Generosity: Grants a +4 insight bonus on attack rolls and beast shape II as a spell-like ability. Opposed by humility and love.  Humility: Grants a +8 insight bonus on skill checks and greater invisibility as a spell-like ability. Opposed by generosity and zeal.  Kindness: Grants a +4 insight bonus on weapon damage rolls and ice storm as a spell-like ability. Opposed by charity and zeal.  Love: Grants a +8 insight bonus on initiative checks and charm monster as a spell-like ability. Opposed by generosity and temperance.

{"_id":"x07VjHWTGORCEBfT","name":"Everdawn Pool [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>The runelords of Thassilon had a long tradition of placing power into pools, liquefying and containing raw magic to harness for  a multitude of goals. Their runewells are perhaps the most notorious of these artifacts, though others, like the Runeforge, exist. But they learned this technique from the artifacts of those who preceded them. The Everdawn Pool is one such artifact. Unlike magical pools created by the runelords, it needs no well as a container-it is a 30-foot-diameter sphere of roiling, churning blood in which brief glimpses of limbs and faces (not all of them humanoid) constantly form and dissolve.  Records of where Sorshen first discovered the Everdawn Pool have been lost, if indeed they ever existed in the first place, along with any hint of who or what may have created this potent font of magical power (although certain obscure sources hint at Leng and the creatures known as the scarlet walkers that dwell in that nightmare realm). What seems certain is that she-and later, other runelords-were able to reverse engineer some of the Everdawn Pool's properties and build pools of power of their own. In many cases, these pools even surpassed the Everdawn Pool. Certainly, the power of Karzoug's Runewell of Greed exceeds that of the Everdawn Pool, as would, one would guess, the runewells created by those more powerful than him (Xanderghul, Alaznist, and Sorshen). Yet the Everdawn Pool remains the first. It provided a legacy that helped shape all of Thassilon, and was a significant part of what gave Sorshen the boost in power to claim and keep the role of Runelord of Lust for the duration of that ancient empire.  The Everdawn Pool requires specially prepared blood to function. A single drop of blood and one 12-hour ritual performed by any character capable of casting 9th-level spells who succeeds at a DC 30 Spellcraft check is enough to awaken the pool and grant it 1 charge. Additional charges can be stored in the Everdawn Pool by performing this ritual multiple times, but only one such ritual can be performed at any one time (effectively limiting the Everdawn Pool's capacity to be recharged to a rate of no more than 2 charges per day). The pool can store up to 25 charges at a time, but when the PCs start Part 3 of Crown of Fangs, Queen Ileosa has used most of what she stored within and the Everdawn Pool has only 10 charges stored within it.  A creature that spends 10 minutes bathing in the blood of the Everdawn Pool becomes infused with its power for 1 week, during which time the creature is immune to bleed effects and modifies its total hit points with its Charisma modifier rather than its Constitution modifier. While immersed, a creature has no need to eat, drink, or breathe, and can see into every chamber of the Sunken Queen as if using an unlimited number of clairaudience/clairvoyance sensors. The creature can still observe only one location at a time, but can switch locations as a move action. As a side effect, a creature that has been so infused can use teleport effects within the Sunken Queen without restriction. The Everdawn Pool must have at least 1 charge stored to grant these boons to those that bathe within its waters, but granting these boons does not deplete its charges.  Once a creature is infused with the Everdawn Pool's power, it can spend the pool's charges to use the following abilities, as long as the creature is fully immersed in the pool at the time.  Blood Simulacrum: A creature infused with the Everdawn Pool's power can spend 2 of the pool's charges to create a blood simulacrum of itself. This creation takes 12 hours to complete and functions the same as that created by the spell simulacrum, save that the simulacrum's creator can choose at the time of creation to grant a blood simulacrum the redirection ability (see the False Ileosa statistics on page 363). Up to seven blood simulacra can exist at any one time, but only one can have the redirection ability at a time.  Create Life: Once per day, a creature can use the Everdawn Pool to manifest a living creature to serve as a loyal minion-the type of creature created is determined by the combined power of the user's soul and personality, but as a general rule the pool creates a minion whose CR is 3 lower than the creator's CR. In Ileosa's case, life created using this power manifests as a taniniver (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 4 258). Creatures created by other NPCs (or even PCs) should be selected and customized as needed by the GM to represent the source. Only one life can be created by the Everdawn Pool at a time, and as long as the created life lives, it remains loyal to its creator unless it's subjected to mind control effects. Creating life costs 5 charges but requires only a standard action.  Eternal Youth: The ritual to gain eternal youth requires blood samples from numerous mortals to be mixed into the Everdawn Pool. Once this step is completed, a creature must immerse itself in the Everdawn Pool, soaking in the pool's power. At the end of each day, the pool expends 1 charge. Once the user has spent 100 charges in this manner, and as long as all 100 charges were spent within the span of a single year, all of those creatures that provided blood samples drop dead, and for each donor that dies, the user ceases to age for 1 year. Ileosa has infused the Everdawn Pool with blood harvested from thousands of Korvosans, so if she completes this ritual, she'll remain young for thousands of years-more than enough time to repeat the ritual as she needs to extend her effective immortality. This adventure assumes that she is only 10 days (and thus 10 charges) away from completing her ritual when the PCs begin Part 3 of Chapter 6-see page 388 for more details. Note that using this function of the Everdawn Pool is an evil act and may have alignment repercussions for the user.  Manifest Magic: At a cost of 20 charges, a creature can activate the Everdawn Pool as a standard action to cast wish, but only in that spell's capacity to duplicate an existing spell. Sorshen often used this ability to cast necromancy or transmutation spells, magic her specialization normally forbade her from using. The pool currently doesn't have enough charges remaining for Ileosa to use this ability.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Curse Of The Crimson Throne Chapter Appendix","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":1200},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Everdawn Pool","cl":20,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"enchantment illusion and necromancy"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"everdawnPoolArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265239,"modifiedTime":1677435299261,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The specific image shown varies from person to person, even when more than one person looks into the mirror at the same time. The mirror's effect functions as a gaze attack that affects everyone who sees the surface of the mirror, which the bearer can actively direct at a target as a standard action. Unless an observer succeeds at a DC 27 Will save, she is fascinated, staring blankly at the mirror for as long as it remains in view and for 2d4 minutes thereafter, during which she continues to stare in the direction she last saw the mirror. Unlike the normal fascinated condition, the effect created by the mirror is not automatically broken by an obvious threat; instead, a fascinated creature receives a new saving throw for each such threat, with a +6 circumstance bonus. At the GM's discretion, a truly innocent creature or a character who  has renounced all worldly pleasures may be immune to the mirror's fascination effect.  While a creature is fascinated by the Mirror of Sorshen, the artifact's bearer can speak a command word to compel her service for 30 days (as per dominate monster with no saving throw). There is no limit to the number of such thralls a bearer can have. The domination effect ends for a victim after 30 days, but if the victim sees the mirror again at any point before this duration expires, it is automatically extended for an additional 30 days from the moment it caught sight of the mirror anew.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>AP 137","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":2},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Mirror Of Sorshen","cl":25,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"enchantment"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"mirrorOfSorshenArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265241,"modifiedTime":1677435299261,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

In the hands of a paladin, the Thorncrown reveals its true powers, bursting into flames and spinning above the wearer's head in a halo of divine power. Paladins of any faith who wear the Thorncrown have their class abilities enhanced for as long as they wear it, gaining three additional mercies (from levels they have access to but have not selected), healing the maximum amount possible every time they use lay on hands, and gaining a number of additional uses of smite evil equal to their Charisma modifier. Additionally, if a paladin wearing the Thorncrown is slain, she may choose to instantly be restored to full hit points for a number of minutes equal to her Charisma modifier. She may act as normal for this period, but at the end of this time she dies and cannot be restored by any means short of a miracle cast by a cleric of her faith.  The Thorncrown of Iomedae bestows two negative levels on any evil creature that wears it. These negative levels remain as long as the Thorncrown is held or worn-though they never result in actual level loss, they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the creature possesses the Thorncrown. Additionally, paladins who either break their code of conduct while wearing the Thorncrown or do not have access to their class features when they don the artifact must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or instantly be disintegrated. Those slain by the Thorncrown cannot be brought back to life by clerics with good or lawful components to their alignment-their spells simply fail-though clerics of other alignments can restore a paladin as normal.

{"_id":"zg7BRL0DO5u4ulNz","name":"Sigils Of The Great Cataclysm [Artifact]","type":"equipment","img":"systems/pf1/icons/skills/yellow_30.jpg","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2></b>Description</b></h2></p><p>Sigils of the great cataclysm are collections of items designed to bring about doom and suffering, usually to a city or large town. A set of sigils consists of seven seals of stone, clay, or black iron.  The sigils' foul magic takes effect only when they are buried or hidden on the points of an imaginary seven-pointed star covering up to a 3-mile radius. Once the final sigil is set in place, the sigils create a sequence of effects, one per week, each lasting for 1 week. For the first four sigils' effects, each living creature in the area has a certain chance to be targeted each day. Each affected creature suffers the effects at a different random time during the day. The final three sigils' effects each last for a full week and target the entire area as described below.  First Sigil: Each living creature in the area has a 10% chance of being affected by feast of ashesAPG (Will DC 17 negates).  Second Sigil: Each living creature in the area has a 20% chance of being affected by rage (Will DC 18 negates).  Third Sigil: Each living creature in the area has a 30% chance of being affected by contagion with a random disease (Fortitude DC 19 negates).  Fourth Sigil: Each living creature in the area has a 40% chance of being surrounded a deadly miasma and affected as per cloudkill (Fortitude DC 20 negates).  Fifth Sigil: The area experiences severe storms as if under the effects of control weather.  Sixth Sigil: Random 40-foot-radius spaces within the area are affected as if by earthquake. The earthquake affects a single 40-foot-radius space each round, then moves to a new location.  Seventh Sigil: Fiery spheres fall from the sky. One sphere affects a 40-foot-radius area for 1d6 rounds, then vanishes; the next round another sphere affects a new location. A sphere deals 2d6 points of damage + 1d6 points of fire damage to creatures and objects each round (Reflex DC 23 half) and can ignite flammable materials.  Once the cycle of destruction begins, each sigil's effect can be stopped only by moving that sigil from its spot on the seven-pointed star. Moving a seal ends its effects immediately.<br><p><b>Base Item:</b> </p><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Source: </b></h3>Villain Codex","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Sigils Of The Great Cataclysm","cl":18,"aura":{"custom":true,"school":"enchantment evocation necromancy and transmutation [evil]"},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"sigilsOfTheGreatCataclysmArtifact","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{}},"scriptCalls":[],"masterwork":false,"enh":null,"proficient":true,"held":"normal","equipmentType":"misc","equipmentSubtype":"other","armor":{"value":0,"dex":null,"acp":0,"enh":0},"spellFailure":0,"slot":"slotless","showInQuickbar":false,"primaryAttack":true,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attackType":"weapon","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428265263,"modifiedTime":1677435299262,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
