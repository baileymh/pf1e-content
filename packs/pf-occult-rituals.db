A trusted minion or ally can cast this spell on the caster's behalf; it's common for a spellcaster to gain a cacodaemon, im, or quasit familiar so that it can use its <em>commune</em> spell-like ability for this purpose. Once contact is made, the patron must be told of the caster's desire to become a fiend; during this time, the <em>commune</em> or <em>contact other plane</em> spell cannot be used to ask any other questions. At any point thereafter but before a year has passed, the caster must offer a significant sacrifice to her fiendish patron as a burned offering in a temple consecrated to the fiend. This offering can be either living or dead, but the burned offering must be of someone who is related to the caster by blood or family (such as a spouse or an adopted parent or child) and the caster and the offering must once have shared a positive emotional connection such as love or pride. If this ritual fails, the caster can try again, although the number of attempts she can make is limited in that each new attempt requires a burned offering of a different relative. Once the second apotheosis is successful, part of the caster's body transforms into something fiendish as proof of her patron's favor. Use the various fleshcraft grafts to model these partial transformations; the specific transformation granted is up to the GM, but typical results include <em>claw gauntlet</em> or <em>wings of darkness</em>.

The primary caster begins the ritual by delineating the boundaries of the area to be affected using the black diamond dust.

Upon the ritual's completion, magical darkness fills the designated area as the Material Plane and Shadow Plane blend together there. The affected area thereafter exists simultaneously on both planes, becoming an amalgam of the two. A thin layer of impenetrable darkness surrounds the affected area, so it is impossible to see beyond the area's boundaries into either plane. Colors appear faded in the area, but not completely black and white as on the Shadow Plane. The area has the enhanced magic and impeded magic traits of the Shadow Plane, but all other planar traits correspond to those of the Material Plane.

This condition can be a password, a specific action that a creature must take (such as stepping through a mirror), or a specific type of item that a creature must carry in order to cross over.

When all the mice are caged, she then places the cat figurine within the cage. If the ritual succeeds, the figurine animates for a short period, during which it kills each of the caged mice. As each mouse is killed, the head of a target is transformed into a mouse head of a suitable size for the ritual's duration.

Once every year, on the anniversary of the day the primary caster completed the third apotheosis, she can perform a special ceremony that recounts her accomplishments over the past year and culminates in a significant sacrifice (usually consisting of the sacrifice of an important member of an enemy faith,or of a lawful or good outsider; in either case, the sacrifice must be at least CR 9). If this ritual is a success, the primary caster transforms into a full-fledged fiend: she loses all benefits of her previous race and the half-fiend template but can immediately apply all of her class levels to her new fiendish race (for example, a human fighter 10 could become a vrock fighter 10). The type of fiend that she transforms into depends on both the nature of her chosen fiendish patron and the GM's discretion, but it should generally not have a total number of Hit Dice more than twice her original Hit Dice.

A key component of the ritual is a forked rod, just like that used for a <em>plane shift</em> spell. Any other device suitable for use as a focus component for <em>plane shift</em> is also suitable for use with this ritual. The casters form a circle around the target, each touching the shoulder of the caster to his left to form a ring representing the multiverse as a whole. The primary caster stands inside this ring with the target, holding the diamond in one hand and the forked rod in the other. As the casters chant, the primary caster walks around the target in a circle. At the conclusion of the ritual, the primary caster touches the forked rod to the black diamond, which shatters. If the ritual is performed successfully, the target's soul is immediately sent to the designated plane and manifests there as a petitioner or another appropriate outsider, just as if the designated plane were the soul's appropriate reward and regardless of the soul's actual alignment or outlook. If the target is a helpless creature, it is slain by this effect (no save). If the target is a soul trapped inside an object, the object is emptied when the soul departs to its designated destination.</p><p></p><p> As this ritual bypasses the soul's judgment and natural passage to the afterlife, it is considered anathema to the psychopomps.

Under the shadow of the new moon, the entire coven and the prospective member must prepare a bowl of rich red wine as they dance and chant, with each member adding handfuls of rare and expensive herbs. At midnight, the coven consumes the wine together. If the ritual is a success, the newcomer becomes a full member of the coven; see the details of forming a coven under the monster entry for a green hag.

At the ritual's start, the caster stands at the center of the circle of victims and chants while holding the onyx aloft. The evil energy emanating from the caster slowly siphons the victims' blood through their facial orifices; that blood travels in a liquid line from the victims to the primary caster's onyx. From there, the blood washes over the primary caster.

She counts as a living creature of her previous type, but she retains the immunities granted by the undead type as well as any special abilities granted by her particular type of undead, unless those abilities rely on appearing undead or on physical features her young living body doesn't have (for instance, she would lose horrific appearance or claw attacks gained by becoming undead, but not a lich's paralyzing touch).</p><p></p><p> An incorporeal caster has no body and can't use this ritual, and the same holds true for any non-undead creature that never ages, such as a construct.</p><p></p><p> The caster receives a +5 competence bonus on Charisma-based skill checks other than Use Magic Device. Additionally, whenever she uses an illusion spell or similar effect that makes her appear as someone or something she is not (including <em>disguise self</em>, <em>appearance of life</em>, <em>greater appearance of life</em>, or <em>veil</em>, but not <em>invisibility</em>, <em>displacement</em>, or <em>mirror image</em>), creatures take a â€“10 penalty on saving throws to disbelieve the illusion, and divination magic that would normally allow creatures to see through illusions (such as <em>true seeing</em>) fails to do so for this illusion. If the illusion that changes her appearance causes a negative effect on any creatures that fail their saving throw to disbelieve, the saving throw penalty does not apply.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"null"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"size":"med","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.2","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665428381656,"modifiedTime":1665949146583,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

While the target endures this torture, it must recite the parable of Nidal's pact with Zon-Kuthon while the casters alternatingly chant epic poetry vaguely detailing the Midnight Lord's travels behind reality and the unfathomable horrors that he is capable of inflicting on the target's soul.

Unless the ritual was performed in an area that bars dimensional travel, this feedback draws the attention of a psychopomp or psychopomps of a total CR equal to the CR of the creature whose soul the casters were attempting to trap, and the magical feedback allows the psychopomps to manifest at the location of the ritual to punish the casters for meddling with souls.</p><h3 class=\"framing\">Effect</h3><p>The body of the creature whose soul is to be trapped must be within the ritual's range for the duration. If the body is removed from this area before the ritual is completed, the ritual immediately fails (triggering the failure result detailed above). If the target creature is alive, it must be killed at some point during the ritual's casting time; traditionally this occurs at the end of the ritual, so that if the victim resists having its soul trapped with a successful saving throw, the casters could potentially try to capture the soul a second time by immediately starting a second ritual. If the target creature was already dead, it must have been dead no longer than 1 minute before the soul trap ritual begins, and in this case, the creature's soul can still attempt a Will save to resist the effects as if it were still alive.</p><p></p><p> If the ritual is a success, the creature's soul is transformed into a glittering soul gem. This gem is a fragile Fine object that has hardness 2 and 1 hit point. In this state, the soul cannot be returned to life by any means; the soul gem must first be destroyed, at which point methods of restoring life to the creature function normally.</p><p></p><p> </p><h3 class=\"framing\">THE VALUE OF SOULS</h3><p> Trapped souls are one of the fundamental currencies throughout Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell. Three key factors influence a soul's value in the soul trade: the strength of the soul's life force (which relates directly to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested), the soul's age (how long the soul has been cycled through reincarnation, which directly relates to the sapience of the creature from which the soul was harvested), and the soul's flavor (which is determined by factors that include the alignment, personality, and religion of the creature from which the soul was harvested). Of course, it's worth noting that while trading in souls may prove lucrative, the practice is undeniably evil and an affront to the natural order, and thus it is considered to be an evil act unless one is trading souls for an altruistic purpose (such as to smash purchased prisons and release the souls trapped within). </p><p></p><p><strong>Life Force</strong>: A soul's life force sets its base gp value. This is equal to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested Ã— 1,000. Thus, the base value of a CR 1 creature's soul is 1,000 gp, while the base value of a CR 20 creature's soul is 20,000 gp. </p><p></p><p><strong>Age</strong>: A soul from a creature who in life had an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 2 or less (including the lack of a score at all in one of those categories, and regardless of how high the other ability scores were) is less refined and younger in age, and as such is worth half its base value. Thus, the soul of a CR 1 animal with an Intelligence of 1 is worth 500 gp, while the soul of a CR 20 vermin with no intelligence score at all would be worth 10,000 gp. </p><p></p><p><strong>Flavor</strong>: As a general rule, a soul's flavor has no direct impact on its gp value for the purposes of functioning as a material component or raw materials for magic item creation, but in certain circumstances subject to the GM's discretion, the soul's flavor can halve or double its final value. For example, a paladin's soul might have double its normal value to a daemon who finds lawful good souls to be particularly delicious, while the soul of a devout worshiper of Desna might be worth only half as much when used to create a magic item designed to be particularly deadly when used against chaotic good creatures, since such a soul would inherently resist being used in such a way.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":"one living or recently dead creature"},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"will","description":"negates"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"size":"med","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.2","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665428381663,"modifiedTime":1665949146584,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Typically, this results in the caster being conjured elsewhere via powerful magic to perform services-at the GM's discretion, this could be played out, or the caster could simply return to his point of origin 4d6 hours later with 1d6 points of ability drain, 1d3 negative levels, a strange curse, or some other affliction but with no memories of how this affliction came to be.

(In the latter case, the fiendish demigod or quasi deity's true name changes once the caster learns it, so this information is useful only once, and in the event of a failure, the demigod or quasi deity learns the caster's true name instead.) Once a creature's true name is divulged by the manifestation of the <em>Book of the Damned's</em> list of true names, the caster can use that information how he sees fit, but abuse of the information will likely have repercussions. For example, a caster who gains a reputation for spreading a powerful fiend's true name far and wide could find himself hunted by a wide range of powerful fiends, all eager to see the caster destroyed. Such reprisals rise not out of any sort of familial devotion to the inconvenienced fiend but purely from self-defense, for who is to say which fiend's true name might next be publicized by such a careless caster?</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"null"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"size":"med","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.2","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665428381665,"modifiedTime":1665949146584,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The circle must be painstakingly molded to attune it to the alignment targeted (chaos, evil, good, or law), which is chosen during the time of creation. The ritual gains the descriptor of the alignment selected. Once the circle is complete, it becomes invisible to all but the casters of the ritual or to creatures with <em>see invisibility</em>, <em>true seeing</em>, or some other method of seeing invisible objects.</p><p></p><p> Once the circle is complete, it can be used to trap an outsider whose subtype matches the chosen alignment, as if it were an inward-focused magic circle spell of the appropriate type (thus, an ensnaring circle attuned to evil acts like an inward-focused <em>magic circle against evil</em>). For an outsider to be trapped in this manner, the entire space of the outsider must be within the circle, at which point the primary caster can activate the circle as an immediate action. The primary caster must be within 100 feet of the circle and be able to see it and the outsider he wishes to trap in order to activate the circle. It is possible to trap multiple outsiders of the appropriate subtype in the circle if more than one are in the circle when it is activated. However, if any such outsider is not completely within the circle, it is not caught within the circle's confines and is free to disrupt the circle as described in the <em>magic circle against evil</em> spell description.</p><p></p><p> As with a magic circle, the trapped outsider cannot cross the circle's boundaries or reach over or beyond the boundaries, nor can it disrupt the circle either directly or indirectly, though it can make ranged attacks beyond the circle's boundaries. If the outsider has spell resistance, it can test the trap once per day. If the primary caster fails to overcome the outsider's spell resistance, the circle is disrupted and the outsider is freed from the circle's restraints. An outsider capable of any form of dimensional travel can simply leave the circle using such an ability.</p><p></p><p> Unlike with a magic circle, you cannot create a special diagram when creating the circle to make the ensnaring circle more secure.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"will","description":"negates (harmless), see text"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"size":"med","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.2","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665428381671,"modifiedTime":1665949146584,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

If she already has this feat, she gains a +20 competence bonus on skill checks to harvest material components from the specific creature or haunt and the gp value of those components doubles.

Vines and other plants appropriate to the region grow over all buildings and structures in the area, dealing damage to them at a rate of 3 hit points every 10 minutes, ignoring their hardness. A typical wooden building can withstand 100 points of damage before being wrecked, while a typical stone building can withstand 150 points of damage before its complete destruction. The plants do not deal damage to creatures directly, though creatures that remain in a building may be injured if it collapses. Heavily fortified stone structures, such as castles and city walls, are sturdy enough to withstand this ritual.

Other organizations might have their own versions of the ritual, substituting Perception and Stealth for two skills appropriate to the organization (such as Knowledge [religion] for a church).

The primary caster acknowledges any society leaders who are present and invites them to reject the initiate if they choose.

If this occurs, all casters suffer the backlash, but there is no failure effect.</p><p></p><p> If the ritual continues, the initiate must attempt either the Stealth or Perception check as a test. If the initiate fails this, the ritual fails regardless of the number of other successes, but if the ritual would otherwise succeed, only the initiate suffers the failure effect. Finally, the primary caster collects the initiate's blood into an appropriate receptacle and immerses a membership token in the blood while the initiate speaks the oaths of membership. When the initiate finishes the final oath, the ritual is complete and the backlash occurs. If the ritual is successful, each caster other than the initiate immediately knows who and what the initiate is, as per <em>blood biography</em>, as well as any lies the initiate deliberately and knowingly spoke during the ceremony, as per <em>discern lies</em>. If no falsehood is revealed, the initiation succeeds and the membership token is attuned to the new member. Thereafter, when worn or carried by the member, the token grants a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks to pass secret messages to members of the organization and a +5 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks to receive secret messages from members of the organization, in addition to any other properties the token has.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":"creature touched"},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"null"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"size":"med","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.2","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665428381681,"modifiedTime":1665949146585,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The ritual must be performed at a site of Sarenite worship (such as a dervish house, shrine, or temple of Sarenrae) that has hosted active worship services for at least 52 consecutive weeks. The primary caster holds aloft the rose-gold scimitar, and the secondary casters stand around him and begin spinning in place. The primary caster recites 23 verses from Sarenrae's holy text, The <em>Birth of Light and Truth</em>, taking a sip from the <em>potion of cat's grace</em> between each stanza. After the last verse is completed, the secondary casters whirl around the primary caster, each anointing the rose-gold scimitar with blessed sunflower seed oil. Upon the successful completion of the ritual, all the casters are filled with the spirits of dervish heroes, becoming faster, stronger, tougher, and more skilled in combat. Each caster gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution; a +2 dodge bonus to AC; and a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws. The caster's base attack bonus is equal his character level (which may give the caster multiple attacks). If the caster's base attack bonus is already equal to his character level, he gains one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus when making a full-attack action. In addition, any scimitar wielded by a caster is treated as if it has the keen weapon special ability. In exchange, each caster temporarily loses his ability to cast spells, save for those from the conjuration (healing) school.</p><p></p><p> Finally, once during the duration of the ritual, each caster can activate a whirling dance on the battlefield as a standard action. While dancing, the caster gains the effects of a <em>displacement</em> spell and can use the Spring Attack and Whirlwind Attack feats as if he possessed them without meeting their prerequisites. This dance is a supernatural effect and lasts a number of rounds equal to the primary caster's character level.</p><p></p><p> Each caster of the ritual can individually choose to dismiss the ritual's effects for himself.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"will","description":"negates (harmless)"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"size":"med","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.2","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665428381694,"modifiedTime":1665949146586,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The caster consigns her soul to Abaddon, the Abyss, or Hell even if she never finishes the subsequent rituals. The caster must select a powerful fiend at this point to serve as a demonic patron. The acts the caster must undertake can vary, but they should be of a nature that represents and honors the areas of interest of her chosen demonic patron-these acts are intended to attract the patron's attention, after all. Even casters who begin the transformation ritual with an evil alignment must undergo this stage of the ritual, if only to select a fiendish patron.</p><p></p><p> On the day precisely 1 year after she began these evil acts, she must perform the 4-hour first apotheosis ritual to properly devote her previous year in the name of her chosen patron.

This ritual has no visible effect to mortal eyes, but it creates a powerful rending cut in the world of spirits. By successfully completing this ritual, the caster can achieve one of two goals: severing a kami from its ward, or untethering a bound companion.</p><p></p><p> <strong>Sever Kami Ward</strong>: Successfully completing the ritual forces the ward's kami to attempt a Will save (use the kami's Will save in the case of targeting its ward). On a failed save, the kami loses its connection with its ward. This functions as if the kami's ward were destroyed: the kami cannot merge with its ward, it loses its fast healing, and it is permanently sickened. Many kami suffering from this cruel fate transform into malicious oni. </p><p></p><p><strong>Untether Companion</strong>: Successfully completing the ritual forces the creature whose animal or spiritual companion, such as an eidolon or phantom, was targeted to attempt a Will save. Failing this save causes the creature to lose its bond with the targeted animal companion or spirit. An animal companion severed in this manner retains its abilities and statistics, but it gains an intense loathing for its former master. In the case of eidolons or phantoms, the severed companion gains the unfettered eidolon template or becomes an unfettered phantom with the appropriate Hit Dice. For creatures with animal companions, this functions as if the creature's companion had been slain, allowing the target to gain a new companion. For creatures with bonded spirits (such as spiritualists), the means of gaining a new companion are left to the GM's discretion.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":"one animal companion, eidolon, kami ward, or phantom (see text)"},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"will","description":"negates, see text"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"size":"med","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.2","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665428381704,"modifiedTime":1665949146587,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The primary caster begins this ritual by mixing her blood with the diamond dust, smearing each weapon with the mixture, and placing the weapons in a circle around herself. The primary caster then holds each weapon and demonstrates the weapon in a combat performance. After the primary caster finishes her performance with a weapon, she places the weapon into the air in front of her, now held in midair by her force of ego.</p><p></p><p> Upon successful completion of this ritual, ghostly apparitions of the primary caster appear and grasp each of the weapons before fading, representing the shards of the primary caster's own ego placed within each weapon. The egoist weapons are treated as if they are held by the primary caster, using her base attack bonus, ability scores, and any relevant feats when calculating their attack and damage rolls, but the weapons function independently from the primary caster. Egoist weapons make attacks on the primary caster's initiative. When moving, egoist weapons have a fly speed of 100 feet. An egoist weapon uses the statistics of the base weapon and retains its magical enhancements and material properties. For every 2 Hit Dice the primary caster has, an egoist weapon has a hardness of 10 and 5 hit points (magical weapons maintain their additional bonuses to AC and HP). When an egoist weapon is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.</p><p></p><p> All casters who were part of the ritual can issue simple commands to the egoist weapons, and the weapons follow these commands to the best of their abilities. If an egoist weapon completes its task and does not receive further orders, it remains in its location until it receives additional orders.

Example terrain types include (but are not limited to) cave, desert, forest, mountain, sewer, swamp, or tundra. This ritual corrupts the affected area, summoning forth a blight (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 6</em> 38) associated with the terrain as well as turning the affected area into the blight's cursed domain. The DC for skill checks associated with this ritual is 24 plus the CR of the associated blight (for example, DC 37 for a desert blight, DC 40 for a tundra blight, and so on). During the ritual's enactment, the primary caster guides any secondary casters through the terrain, defiling the area with blasphemous words from a long-extinct, primordial language. A bone altar, often assembled from sacrificed animals or humanoids, must stand at the center of the area to be affected, and is the starting and ending point of the ritual. Once the surrounding area is suitably prepared, the primary caster deposits the preserved hearts into the altar.

Typical materials (and a list of creatures affected by those materials) include cold iron powder (daemons, demons, and fey), mithral or silver powder (devils and lycanthropes), oil mixed with sulfur (agathions, angels, archons, and azatas), and salt (undead and outsiders with the incorporeal subtype). At the GM's decision, additional materials may be available for use against other creatures. The area to be affected must be enclosed, with no gaps in the material's outline.</p><p></p><p> If the ritual is successful, creatures to whom the used material is anathema cannot enter or exit the warded area, much as if the area were under the effects of an outward facing magic circle effect against those creatures. Those creatures cannot cross the area's boundaries or exit it by any means, including via extradimensional travel (<em>astral projection</em>, <em>blink</em>, <em>dimension door</em>, <em>etherealness</em>, <em>gate</em>, <em>plane shift</em>, <em>shadow walk</em>, <em>teleport</em>, <em>wind walk</em>, or similar means), and they cannot reach across the area's boundaries with melee attacks (even those with greater than 5 feet of reach). Incorporeal creatures cannot enter or pass through solid objects into or out of a warded area. An affected creature can make physical ranged attacks at targets within the earthbound ward, but the ward blocks line of effect (but not line of sight) for spells. Flight allows a creature to pass over earthbound wards, but it cannot approach closer than 10 feet off the ground within the area outlined by the ward. A flying creature that falls or otherwise attempts to land in the area is instead shunted to the closest available area just outside of the earthbound ward's area of effect and is knocked prone.</p><p></p><p> If the markings used to create an earthbound ward are disturbed or defaced, the effects of the ritual immediately cease. Physical efforts (such as scratching, erasing, or otherwise breaking or damaging the materials), spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities used by a creature for whom the material is anathema cannot target the markings. Such creatures can damage the markings as a consequence of those abilities, so long as the markings aren't directly targeted. For example, such a creature can use <em>earthquake</em> to disturb an earthbound ward set against it because the spell targets an area, not the markings itself. The ritual's magic prevents minor effects from disrupting the wards, although severe or stronger winds can do so.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"null"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"size":"med","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.2","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665428381726,"modifiedTime":1665949146589,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

As long as the caster does not move from her space, and does not stop holding the focus dagger, she can use the dagger to cut into the weakened border between the two planes as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, but she must do so within 1 hour per character level after successfully completing the ritual and taking the backlash. Doing so has an immediate and dramatic effect-the rip attempts to suck all creatures and unattended objects within 30 feet of the caster's space that weigh less than 200 pounds into either the Ethereal Plane (if the rip is made on the Material Plane) or the Material Plane (if the rip is made on the Ethereal Plane). With a successful Reflex save, a creature avoids the rip's pull. Creatures and objects pulled into the rift land in a corresponding space on the other plane. The ritual caster can choose whether she wants to be sucked through the rift or stay on the plane where she cast the ritual.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"Reflex","description":"negates"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"size":"med","range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.2","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1665428381737,"modifiedTime":1665949146590,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}
