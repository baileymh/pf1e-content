A trusted minion or ally can cast this spell on the caster's behalf; it's common for a spellcaster to gain a cacodaemon, im, or quasit familiar so that it can use its <em>commune</em> spell-like ability for this purpose. Once contact is made, the patron must be told of the caster's desire to become a fiend; during this time, the <em>commune</em> or <em>contact other plane</em> spell cannot be used to ask any other questions. At any point thereafter but before a year has passed, the caster must offer a significant sacrifice to her fiendish patron as a burned offering in a temple consecrated to the fiend. This offering can be either living or dead, but the burned offering must be of someone who is related to the caster by blood or family (such as a spouse or an adopted parent or child) and the caster and the offering must once have shared a positive emotional connection such as love or pride. If this ritual fails, the caster can try again, although the number of attempts she can make is limited in that each new attempt requires a burned offering of a different relative. Once the second apotheosis is successful, part of the caster's body transforms into something fiendish as proof of her patron's favor. Use the various fleshcraft grafts to model these partial transformations; the specific transformation granted is up to the GM, but typical results include <em>claw gauntlet</em> or <em>wings of darkness</em>.

The primary caster begins the ritual by delineating the boundaries of the area to be affected using the black diamond dust. The casters link hands and chant verses from Zon-Kuthon's holy book, <em>Umbral Leaves</em>. Upon the ritual's completion, magical darkness fills the designated area as the Material Plane and Shadow Plane blend together there. The affected area thereafter exists simultaneously on both planes, becoming an amalgam of the two. A thin layer of impenetrable darkness surrounds the affected area, so it is impossible to see beyond the area's boundaries into either plane. Colors appear faded in the area, but not completely black and white as on the Shadow Plane. The area has the enhanced magic and impeded magic traits of the Shadow Plane, but all other planar traits correspond to those of the Material Plane.

While casting this ritual, the primary caster can set a condition that allows creatures to cross over from the Shadow Plane to the Material Plane or vice versa. This condition can be a password, a specific action that a creature must take (such as stepping through a mirror), or a specific type of item that a creature must carry in order to cross over.

Illumination in the area can never be brighter than dim light, and only a <em>miracle</em> or <em>wish</em> can even temporarily alleviate this restriction (though direct intervention of a deity can end the ritual's effect). Any light beyond dim light that would touch the area is instead transported into the <em>ioun stone</em> shards consumed by the secondary casters, making the secondary casters' entire bodies glow. Any object with a light spell having its light thus dimmed by the ritual counts as a part of the secondary casters' bodies for the purpose of a connection for spells like <em>scrying</em>. Collecting these ioun stone shards then piecing them back together while within the affected area ends the effects of this ritual.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"null"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428381642,"modifiedTime":1677435552031,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

When all the mice are caged, she then places the cat figurine within the cage. If the ritual succeeds, the figurine animates for a short period, during which it kills each of the caged mice. As each mouse is killed, the head of a target is transformed into a mouse head of a suitable size for the ritual's duration.

If this ritual is a success, the primary caster transforms into a full-fledged fiend: she loses all benefits of her previous race and the half-fiend template but can immediately apply all of her class levels to her new fiendish race (for example, a human fighter 10 could become a vrock fighter 10).

A key component of the ritual is a forked rod, just like that used for a <em>plane shift</em> spell. Any other device suitable for use as a focus component for <em>plane shift</em> is also suitable for use with this ritual. The casters form a circle around the target, each touching the shoulder of the caster to his left to form a ring representing the multiverse as a whole. The primary caster stands inside this ring with the target, holding the diamond in one hand and the forked rod in the other. As the casters chant, the primary caster walks around the target in a circle. At the conclusion of the ritual, the primary caster touches the forked rod to the black diamond, which shatters. If the ritual is performed successfully, the target's soul is immediately sent to the designated plane and manifests there as a petitioner or another appropriate outsider, just as if the designated plane were the soul's appropriate reward and regardless of the soul's actual alignment or outlook. If the target is a helpless creature, it is slain by this effect (no save). If the target is a soul trapped inside an object, the object is emptied when the soul departs to its designated destination.</p><p></p><p> As this ritual bypasses the soul's judgment and natural passage to the afterlife, it is considered anathema to the psychopomps.

At the ritual's start, the caster stands at the center of the circle of victims and chants while holding the onyx aloft. The evil energy emanating from the caster slowly siphons the victims' blood through their facial orifices; that blood travels in a liquid line from the victims to the primary caster's onyx. From there, the blood washes over the primary caster.

Her skin looks supple and healthy, her eyes are bright and sparkle like jewels, and her voice sounds musical.</p><p></p><p> If the caster is undead, she returns to her previous creature type (before dying and becoming undead) for the ritual's duration, treating her Constitution score as being equal to her Charisma score when necessary. She counts as a living creature of her previous type, but she retains the immunities granted by the undead type as well as any special abilities granted by her particular type of undead, unless those abilities rely on appearing undead or on physical features her young living body doesn't have (for instance, she would lose horrific appearance or claw attacks gained by becoming undead, but not a lich's paralyzing touch).</p><p></p><p> An incorporeal caster has no body and can't use this ritual, and the same holds true for any non-undead creature that never ages, such as a construct.</p><p></p><p> The caster receives a +5 competence bonus on Charisma-based skill checks other than Use Magic Device. Additionally, whenever she uses an illusion spell or similar effect that makes her appear as someone or something she is not (including <em>disguise self</em>, <em>appearance of life</em>, <em>greater appearance of life</em>, or <em>veil</em>, but not <em>invisibility</em>, <em>displacement</em>, or <em>mirror image</em>), creatures take a –10 penalty on saving throws to disbelieve the illusion, and divination magic that would normally allow creatures to see through illusions (such as <em>true seeing</em>) fails to do so for this illusion. If the illusion that changes her appearance causes a negative effect on any creatures that fail their saving throw to disbelieve, the saving throw penalty does not apply.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"null"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428381656,"modifiedTime":1677435552033,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

This often involves whips, spiked chains, barbed hooks, or other torturous elements usually constructed from the target's own skin and viscera. While the target endures this torture, it must recite the parable of Nidal's pact with Zon-Kuthon while the casters alternatingly chant epic poetry vaguely detailing the Midnight Lord's travels behind reality and the unfathomable horrors that he is capable of inflicting on the target's soul.

If the body is removed from this area before the ritual is completed, the ritual immediately fails (triggering the failure result detailed above). If the target creature is alive, it must be killed at some point during the ritual's casting time; traditionally this occurs at the end of the ritual, so that if the victim resists having its soul trapped with a successful saving throw, the casters could potentially try to capture the soul a second time by immediately starting a second ritual. If the target creature was already dead, it must have been dead no longer than 1 minute before the soul trap ritual begins, and in this case, the creature's soul can still attempt a Will save to resist the effects as if it were still alive.</p><p></p><p> If the ritual is a success, the creature's soul is transformed into a glittering soul gem. This gem is a fragile Fine object that has hardness 2 and 1 hit point. In this state, the soul cannot be returned to life by any means; the soul gem must first be destroyed, at which point methods of restoring life to the creature function normally.</p><p></p><p> </p><h3 class=\"framing\">THE VALUE OF SOULS</h3><p> Trapped souls are one of the fundamental currencies throughout Abaddon, the Abyss, and Hell. Three key factors influence a soul's value in the soul trade: the strength of the soul's life force (which relates directly to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested), the soul's age (how long the soul has been cycled through reincarnation, which directly relates to the sapience of the creature from which the soul was harvested), and the soul's flavor (which is determined by factors that include the alignment, personality, and religion of the creature from which the soul was harvested). Of course, it's worth noting that while trading in souls may prove lucrative, the practice is undeniably evil and an affront to the natural order, and thus it is considered to be an evil act unless one is trading souls for an altruistic purpose (such as to smash purchased prisons and release the souls trapped within). </p><p></p><p><strong>Life Force</strong>: A soul's life force sets its base gp value. This is equal to the CR of the creature from which the soul was harvested × 1,000. Thus, the base value of a CR 1 creature's soul is 1,000 gp, while the base value of a CR 20 creature's soul is 20,000 gp. </p><p></p><p><strong>Age</strong>: A soul from a creature who in life had an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score of 2 or less (including the lack of a score at all in one of those categories, and regardless of how high the other ability scores were) is less refined and younger in age, and as such is worth half its base value.

Typically, this results in the caster being conjured elsewhere via powerful magic to perform services-at the GM's discretion, this could be played out, or the caster could simply return to his point of origin 4d6 hours later with 1d6 points of ability drain, 1d3 negative levels, a strange curse, or some other affliction but with no memories of how this affliction came to be.

(In the latter case, the fiendish demigod or quasi deity's true name changes once the caster learns it, so this information is useful only once, and in the event of a failure, the demigod or quasi deity learns the caster's true name instead.) Once a creature's true name is divulged by the manifestation of the <em>Book of the Damned's</em> list of true names, the caster can use that information how he sees fit, but abuse of the information will likely have repercussions. For example, a caster who gains a reputation for spreading a powerful fiend's true name far and wide could find himself hunted by a wide range of powerful fiends, all eager to see the caster destroyed.

Upon successful completion of the ritual, the gem dissolves, the bodies melt into slurry, and a number of sinspawn associated with the sin that corresponds most closely with the soul of the creature bound within the gem (envy, greed, gluttony, lust, pride, sloth, or wrath) form out of the churning mass. Sinspawn created in this way are free willed but are initially well disposed toward the primary caster.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"null"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428381670,"modifiedTime":1677435552034,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

The circle must be painstakingly molded to attune it to the alignment targeted (chaos, evil, good, or law), which is chosen during the time of creation. The ritual gains the descriptor of the alignment selected. Once the circle is complete, it becomes invisible to all but the casters of the ritual or to creatures with <em>see invisibility</em>, <em>true seeing</em>, or some other method of seeing invisible objects.</p><p></p><p> Once the circle is complete, it can be used to trap an outsider whose subtype matches the chosen alignment, as if it were an inward-focused magic circle spell of the appropriate type (thus, an ensnaring circle attuned to evil acts like an inward-focused <em>magic circle against evil</em>). For an outsider to be trapped in this manner, the entire space of the outsider must be within the circle, at which point the primary caster can activate the circle as an immediate action. The primary caster must be within 100 feet of the circle and be able to see it and the outsider he wishes to trap in order to activate the circle. It is possible to trap multiple outsiders of the appropriate subtype in the circle if more than one are in the circle when it is activated. However, if any such outsider is not completely within the circle, it is not caught within the circle's confines and is free to disrupt the circle as described in the <em>magic circle against evil</em> spell description.</p><p></p><p> As with a magic circle, the trapped outsider cannot cross the circle's boundaries or reach over or beyond the boundaries, nor can it disrupt the circle either directly or indirectly, though it can make ranged attacks beyond the circle's boundaries. If the outsider has spell resistance, it can test the trap once per day. If the primary caster fails to overcome the outsider's spell resistance, the circle is disrupted and the outsider is freed from the circle's restraints. An outsider capable of any form of dimensional travel can simply leave the circle using such an ability.</p><p></p><p> Unlike with a magic circle, you cannot create a special diagram when creating the circle to make the ensnaring circle more secure.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"will","description":"negates (harmless), see text"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428381671,"modifiedTime":1677435552034,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

Vines and other plants appropriate to the region grow over all buildings and structures in the area, dealing damage to them at a rate of 3 hit points every 10 minutes, ignoring their hardness. A typical wooden building can withstand 100 points of damage before being wrecked, while a typical stone building can withstand 150 points of damage before its complete destruction. The plants do not deal damage to creatures directly, though creatures that remain in a building may be injured if it collapses.

The primary caster acknowledges any society leaders who are present and invites them to reject the initiate if they choose. If no leaders are present, the primary caster looks for other signs of symbolic rejection, and if any are perceived, the primary caster can cancel the ritual before attempting the required skill checks. If this occurs, all casters suffer the backlash, but there is no failure effect.</p><p></p><p> If the ritual continues, the initiate must attempt either the Stealth or Perception check as a test. If the initiate fails this, the ritual fails regardless of the number of other successes, but if the ritual would otherwise succeed, only the initiate suffers the failure effect. Finally, the primary caster collects the initiate's blood into an appropriate receptacle and immerses a membership token in the blood while the initiate speaks the oaths of membership. When the initiate finishes the final oath, the ritual is complete and the backlash occurs. If the ritual is successful, each caster other than the initiate immediately knows who and what the initiate is, as per <em>blood biography</em>, as well as any lies the initiate deliberately and knowingly spoke during the ceremony, as per <em>discern lies</em>. If no falsehood is revealed, the initiation succeeds and the membership token is attuned to the new member. Thereafter, when worn or carried by the member, the token grants a +5 competence bonus on Bluff checks to pass secret messages to members of the organization and a +5 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks to receive secret messages from members of the organization, in addition to any other properties the token has.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":"creature touched"},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"null"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428381681,"modifiedTime":1677435552035,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

If the ritual is successful, the target is infused with the essence of Axis and can act only with rigid precision. The first ability check, attack roll, caster level check, saving throw, or skill check the target makes each round throughout the ritual's duration is automatically treated as though the natural d20 roll resulted in an 11.

The ritual must be performed at a site of Sarenite worship (such as a dervish house, shrine, or temple of Sarenrae) that has hosted active worship services for at least 52 consecutive weeks. The primary caster holds aloft the rose-gold scimitar, and the secondary casters stand around him and begin spinning in place. The primary caster recites 23 verses from Sarenrae's holy text, The <em>Birth of Light and Truth</em>, taking a sip from the <em>potion of cat's grace</em> between each stanza. After the last verse is completed, the secondary casters whirl around the primary caster, each anointing the rose-gold scimitar with blessed sunflower seed oil. Upon the successful completion of the ritual, all the casters are filled with the spirits of dervish heroes, becoming faster, stronger, tougher, and more skilled in combat. Each caster gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution; a +2 dodge bonus to AC; and a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws. The caster's base attack bonus is equal his character level (which may give the caster multiple attacks). If the caster's base attack bonus is already equal to his character level, he gains one additional attack at his highest base attack bonus when making a full-attack action. In addition, any scimitar wielded by a caster is treated as if it has the keen weapon special ability. In exchange, each caster temporarily loses his ability to cast spells, save for those from the conjuration (healing) school.</p><p></p><p> Finally, once during the duration of the ritual, each caster can activate a whirling dance on the battlefield as a standard action. While dancing, the caster gains the effects of a <em>displacement</em> spell and can use the Spring Attack and Whirlwind Attack feats as if he possessed them without meeting their prerequisites. This dance is a supernatural effect and lasts a number of rounds equal to the primary caster's character level.</p><p></p><p> Each caster of the ritual can individually choose to dismiss the ritual's effects for himself.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"will","description":"negates (harmless)"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428381694,"modifiedTime":1677435552035,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

On a failed save, the kami loses its connection with its ward.

The primary caster begins this ritual by mixing her blood with the diamond dust, smearing each weapon with the mixture, and placing the weapons in a circle around herself.

Egoist weapons make attacks on the primary caster's initiative. When moving, egoist weapons have a fly speed of 100 feet. An egoist weapon uses the statistics of the base weapon and retains its magical enhancements and material properties.

This step involves attempting both Linguistics checks; if the conjuration circle is permanently inscribed and has been successfully used for this ritual at any point in the past, these Linguistics checks are attempted with a +5 bonus. The next 30 minutes of the ritual invokes the fiend, involving the Knowledge and Spellcraft checks; if the fiend's true name is used, these checks are attempted with a +5 bonus. At the start of the final 40 minutes, the smoky, indistinct shape of the fiend manifests within the circle, at which point the caster must attempt the final four Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks. Once this stage is reached, the fiend manifests in the flesh at the end of the ritual regardless of the ritual's success or failure, but only if the ritual is successful is the fiend trapped within the conjuration circle and unable to visit harm upon the caster.</p><p></p><p> If the ritual is successful, the fiend remains on the Material Plane for a number of hours equal to the caster's character level, during which the caster makes an offering to the fiend and asks for its aid. If the caster's alignment is the same as the fiend's, the fiend automatically agrees to perform a service that takes no more time to perform than the ritual's duration. A fiend will agree to perform a longer task if it is given an additional offering for its services. Each offering given must be of equal or greater value to the one given during the ritual's casting and secures the fiend's cooperation for an additional number of hours equal to the caster's character level. At the caster's discretion, the start time for these additional hours can be delayed until a certain circumstance arises, at which point the fiend immediately reappears in its original conjuration circle and can immediately depart to complete its task. If the fiend's true name was used during the ritual, all of these periods of time normally measured in hours (including the ritual's initial duration) are instead measured in days.</p><p></p><p> If at any point during the fiend's servitude the caster is slain or the original conjuration circle is damaged, the fiend can attempt a Will save to escape the ritual's binding power.

Example terrain types include (but are not limited to) cave, desert, forest, mountain, sewer, swamp, or tundra. This ritual corrupts the affected area, summoning forth a blight (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 6</em> 38) associated with the terrain as well as turning the affected area into the blight's cursed domain. The DC for skill checks associated with this ritual is 24 plus the CR of the associated blight (for example, DC 37 for a desert blight, DC 40 for a tundra blight, and so on). During the ritual's enactment, the primary caster guides any secondary casters through the terrain, defiling the area with blasphemous words from a long-extinct, primordial language. A bone altar, often assembled from sacrificed animals or humanoids, must stand at the center of the area to be affected, and is the starting and ending point of the ritual. Once the surrounding area is suitably prepared, the primary caster deposits the preserved hearts into the altar. If the ritual is successful, the associated blight bubbles forth from within the altar, formed from the alchemical soup that the altar contains.</p><p></p><p> This ritual provides no protection against the formed blight, and it's likely that the blight's first action is to attack the primary and secondary casters. Luckily for the primary caster, blights created in this manner have a penchant for consuming the secondary casters first, giving ample time for the primary caster to escape.</p>","showInQuickbar":false,"domain":false,"slotCost":1,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":"standard"},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":2,"type":"action"}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":"other","ability":{"damage":"","damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":"0","type":"null"},"spellDuration":"","spellEffect":"","spellArea":"","spellPoints":{"cost":"1 + @sl"},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf1","systemVersion":"0.82.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1665428381711,"modifiedTime":1677435552037,"lastModifiedBy":"IPeKQhMz2Odi77tR"}}

This task is typically one of significance to the fiend, and in many cases it is one that the primary caster has no hope of completing until she grows more powerful. There is no time limit for how long the primary caster has to complete this task, but she must perform weekly devotions to her fiendish patron in the intervening time in the form of regular worship and continued atrocities in the fiend's name. Additional burned offerings to the demon, assaults on innocents, and betrayals of allies are popular choices. Once the assigned task is completed, the primary caster can perform the third apotheosis. Unlike the first and second rituals, the third apotheosis allows for the use of secondary casters, yet it carries a much greater risk for failure.

The ritual must be performed in a place of significance to the caster and is typically the site where she began her descent into evil, or a site where she committed a great atrocity. Unlike other occult rituals, the secondary casters are simply fodder for the necromantic energies unleashed by the aspiring lich; they do not contribute to the ritual beyond taking the damage of the ritual's backlash. Unlike with normal occult rituals, these secondary casters do not need to be willing participants, but they do need to be within close range (25 feet + 2 feet per character level of the primary caster) of the primary caster for the duration of the ritual. For every seven secondary casters, the ritual's level is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 6th level), the casting time is reduced by 1 hour, and the number of skill checks required decreases by one. When reducing the ritual's level in this manner, the primary caster can choose which check or checks are eliminated. The primary caster also receives a +1 bonus on the required skill checks for every four secondary casters, as normal.</p><p></p><p> Casting this ritual funnels raw and very painful necromantic energy through the primary caster, possibly eviscerating all of the secondary casters in the process.

Typical materials (and a list of creatures affected by those materials) include cold iron powder (daemons, demons, and fey), mithral or silver powder (devils and lycanthropes), oil mixed with sulfur (agathions, angels, archons, and azatas), and salt (undead and outsiders with the incorporeal subtype). At the GM's decision, additional materials may be available for use against other creatures. The area to be affected must be enclosed, with no gaps in the material's outline.</p><p></p><p> If the ritual is successful, creatures to whom the used material is anathema cannot enter or exit the warded area, much as if the area were under the effects of an outward facing magic circle effect against those creatures. Those creatures cannot cross the area's boundaries or exit it by any means, including via extradimensional travel (<em>astral projection</em>, <em>blink</em>, <em>dimension door</em>, <em>etherealness</em>, <em>gate</em>, <em>plane shift</em>, <em>shadow walk</em>, <em>teleport</em>, <em>wind walk</em>, or similar means), and they cannot reach across the area's boundaries with melee attacks (even those with greater than 5 feet of reach). Incorporeal creatures cannot enter or pass through solid objects into or out of a warded area. An affected creature can make physical ranged attacks at targets within the earthbound ward, but the ward blocks line of effect (but not line of sight) for spells. Flight allows a creature to pass over earthbound wards, but it cannot approach closer than 10 feet off the ground within the area outlined by the ward. A flying creature that falls or otherwise attempts to land in the area is instead shunted to the closest available area just outside of the earthbound ward's area of effect and is knocked prone.</p><p></p><p> If the markings used to create an earthbound ward are disturbed or defaced, the effects of the ritual immediately cease. Physical efforts (such as scratching, erasing, or otherwise breaking or damaging the materials), spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities used by a creature for whom the material is anathema cannot target the markings. Such creatures can damage the markings as a consequence of those abilities, so long as the markings aren't directly targeted.

As long as the caster does not move from her space, and does not stop holding the focus dagger, she can use the dagger to cut into the weakened border between the two planes as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, but she must do so within 1 hour per character level after successfully completing the ritual and taking the backlash. Doing so has an immediate and dramatic effect-the rip attempts to suck all creatures and unattended objects within 30 feet of the caster's space that weigh less than 200 pounds into either the Ethereal Plane (if the rip is made on the Material Plane) or the Material Plane (if the rip is made on the Ethereal Plane). With a successful Reflex save, a creature avoids the rip's pull. Creatures and objects pulled into the rift land in a corresponding space on the other plane.

The candle is centered on a circular sigil crafted out of powdered obsidian and lined with unholy water. As the ritual commences, the caster holds aloft the severed head of a good outsider, through which a fiendish patron speaks. The circle channels the patron into the head without summoning its full presence, and the primary caster can choose which evil plane the creature comes from (Abaddon, the Abyss, or Hell).</p><p></p><p> A grueling negotiation determines whether the ritual succeeds or fails.
