Tengus have developed an extensive code of signals and can use their kites to display complex messages visible at great distances. A signal kite kit includes six small colored kites that can be hooked together in different patterns to facilitate complex messages. The kit also includes a spool and 300 feet of twine.

Its twine is strengthened by soaking it in glue and sometimes with crushed glass to give it a slight cutting edge. The kite has hardness 5 and 3 hit points. Participants in a kite battle make alternating sunder combat maneuvers against each other's kites; each successful maneuver allows a competitor to roll 1d6 points of damage against the opponent's kite. When a kite reaches 0 hit points, it is broken or its string is cut, and its player loses the match. In some matches, points are awarded for touching the kite's top to the opponent's string, with the winner being the first to reach a set point total. Those interested in kite-fighting may select the terror kite as a weapon for the purpose of feats such as Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization, and apply these bonuses on kite damage rolls and on their sunder combat maneuver attempts made while using terror kites.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":20,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Terror kite","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"terrorKite","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Entertainment"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"tradeGoods","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"sort":3200000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/cloth/yarn-skein-white-grey.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":100001,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{"pf1":{"sellMultiplier":null},"core":{"sheetClass":"PF1.ActorSheetPFNPCLoot"}}}

Before you use animal glue, you must heat it until it liquefies. You normally apply it with a brush and hold the pieces together for a minute, at which point it is cooled and hardened. The glue is sufficient to coat 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 40 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each.

When squeezed out of its container and exposed to air, bone paste quickly hardens, so in order to apply it to a surface or object one must typically squeeze the paste directly onto the material to be affected. Once applied, bone paste cements itself to the object in just seconds, and hardens into a flaky cast. If applied to any unattended organic material or surface (such as wood, paper, hide, or rope), after 1 hour, bone paste undergoes another alchemical reaction and begins to eat away at the material, dealing 1d4 points of damage each round for 1d6+1 rounds, eating away first at the part of the object to which it was applied and spreading briefly to other parts of the object before dissipating and leaving a small amount of residual dust. Bone paste ignores an organic object's hardness, and does not deal damage to inorganic objects or surfaces (such as metal, stone, or ceramic). One pouch of bone paste is enough to cover 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 20 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 20","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":1,"price":75,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"max":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"bonePaste","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":4700000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/materials/slime-white.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"Uy7lE2zT1rJPE1z2","name":"Bone Reed","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Wilderness pg. 153</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 75 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Herbs<br/><strong>Gather</strong> DC 24; <strong>Yield</strong> 1 dose<br/><strong>Terrain</strong> any swamps<br/><strong>Preparation</strong> A bone reed must be pressed and dried.

The balloon can lift up to 20 pounds of weight as it rises, though carrying more than 10 pounds reduces its speed to 30 feet per round. Multiple balloons attached to a single object add their carrying capacities together when determining how much weight they can lift.

Where other races would be appalled at the thought of plants taking root in their flesh, oreads see it as a natural and healthy extension of their elemental nature. For this reason, oread herbalists developed several strains of moss and lichen specifically adapted to grow on their bodies. Camouflage lichen is the most common variety of these oread plants. It takes 1 minute to apply a paste of camouflage lichen spores to the skin, and an additional 24 hours for the fungus to sprout. After this time, the oread is covered in a thin green layer of living plant matter, granting her a +4 bonus on Stealth checks made in green forest and jungle environments.

During this time, you can keep a vampire at bay (<em>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</em> 270) as a free action without need of a holy symbol or mirror. The vampire must succeed at a DC 25 Will save to overcome its natural revulsion to garlic; failure means it must stay at least 5 feet away from you and cannot touch you or make melee attacks against you. However, unlike while keeping a vampire at bay with a mirror or holy symbol, once the vampire succeeds at its save against the garlic tablets, it's no longer affected by that creature's odor and may act normally without need of further saving throws.<br/><br/> Garlic tablets are valuable aids to vampire hunters, but while benefiting from the tablets' strong odor, you take a -2 penalty on all Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks for the duration of the effect.

If the preparation check's result is a natural 1, the preparer is exposed to those effects regardless of any hand protection worn.

This effect persists for 10 minutes or until the rash is tended with a successful DC 12 Heal check attempted as a full-round action. This is a poison effect, but creatures with the goblinoid subtype are immune to the effect.

These small, elaborately twisting trees are extremely slow to grow and mature-the leaves reach maturity only once every 3 years-and they are almost always grown and cultivated by half-elves. Additionally, half-elves are keenly aware of the effort put into the leaves' growth and normally only sell the products of their labors to others of their kind. When the golden maple's delicate, five-pointed leaves finally take on their namesake's color, they can be cut, dried, and then ground into a fine powder, a process that requires a DC 15 Knowledge (nature) or Profession (herbalist) check. When used in conjunction with the Craft (alchemy) skill to create special substances and items like alchemical grease or tanglefoot bags, golden maple leaves reduce the Craft DC by 5 and add +1 to the DC of any save required by the alchemical item. A single dose of golden maple leaf powder is sufficient to augment the crafting of three alchemical items.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0.5,"price":50,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"max":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"goldenMapleLeaves","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":12400000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/commodities/materials/plant-pot.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"xUWTHs5vO1SU1E5f","name":"Gravelly Tonic","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Advanced Class Guide pg. 207</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 50 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Tools</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>Description</h2>This tonic is sludgy, and its scent resembles the tang of iron shavings.

Such an underwater orb remains suspended in place, not sinking, floating, or drifting away unless moved by a creature. Above water, shaking a vial of light of Axtarr as a move action also makes it shed light like a sunrod for 1d6 hours, after which it is expended. Any area of normal light created by light of Axtarr protects creatures within it from cold temperatures as per <em>endure elements</em>. Alternatively, a spellcaster holding an unused vial of light of Axtarr can expend it as a free action to automatically succeed at a caster level check to cast a fire spell underwater. (Fire spells successfully cast underwater produce steam that still deals fire damage; for more details, see page 46 of <em>Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Aquatic Adventures</em>.) This alternative use does not cause the light of Axtarr to produce light.

When introduced into a dead body, necrobane formaldehyde slows the process of decay, keeping the corpse from stinking and rotting for 1d6 days after death. Treating a body with necrobane formaldehyde takes 1 hour and requires a successful DC 25 Heal check. A corpse injected with necrobane formaldehyde is more difficult to resurrect as an undead creature for 1d6 days after injection. Anyone attempting to seed unlife in a corpse treated in this substance must succeed at a DC 14 caster level check to complete the process or the spell fails and its components are wasted. This is also the case for creatures that ingest necrobane formaldehyde and subsequently die before the effect's duration has expired.<br/><br/> If an undead creature ingests necrobane formaldehyde (perhaps by eating part of an embalmed corpse), the undead creature becomes fatigued for 2d6 rounds.<br/><br/> When ingested by a living creature, necrobane formaldehyde nauseates the imbiber for 1d6 rounds and deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage. A successful DC 14 Fortitude save reduces the nauseated effect to sickened and halves the Constitution damage (minimum 1). This is a poison effect, though the pungent aroma and unmistakably toxic taste of necrobane formaldehyde makes it difficult to use as a surreptitious weapon.<br/><br/> Crafting necrobane formaldehyde requires a successful DC 23 Craft (alchemy) check.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC 23","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":3,"price":60,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"max":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"necrobaneFormaldehyde","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":18700000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/minor-blue.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"KhXeRYDyge9kAX7E","name":"Necrosalt","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Undead Slayer's Handbook pg. 15</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 150 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Tools</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>Description</h2>The powder in this minute glass vial is made of caustic soda treated with consecrated ashes, and is harmless to living flesh but dangerous to the deceased.

Any creature that passes within 5 feet of a diffused poison while it is active must save against the vaporous toxin.<br/><br/> If you are using spontaneous alchemy, adding urea to the alchemical recipe delays a poison diffuser's activation time. For every 20 doses of urea (worth a total of 10 gp) incorporated into the alchemical creation process, the time from which the diffuser is added to the poison to the time the poison begins spreading into the air increases by 1 round.<h2 class=\"framing\">Alchemical Recipe</h2><strong>Recipe</strong> (100 brimstone + 180 salt + 180 spirit of wine)/fermentation; <strong>Craft</strong> 25<br/><strong>Time</strong> 1 day; <strong>Tools</strong> heat source; <strong>Type</strong> alchemical tool","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":200,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"max":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"poisonDiffuser","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":21700000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"qIs8EMr5hpZFniNa","name":"Poison Lip Paint","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Intrigue pg. 233</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 5 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Adventuring Gear</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>Description</h2>Poison lip paint is a favorite among courtiers who practice the arts of deception and intrigue. It allows the wearer to deliver a dose of contact or ingested poison by means of a kiss. This kiss can be to the hand, cheek, or other exposed skin to deliver a contact poison, but must be on the mouth for an ingested poison. A kiss delivers the full dose of the poison, and that application of poison lip paint then becomes nonpoisonous. To use poison lip paint without being exposed to the poison, the wearer must first apply a protective layer of base material. When using an ingested poison, the wearer can instead consume an antidote prior to application. (When the user applies a contact poison, preemptively consuming an antidote results in the wearer's skin harmlessly absorbing the poison, as does immunity to poison.) A kit contains enough base material and lip paint for 10 doses. The poisons must be purchased separately and mixed into the lip paint.

When injected into a mostly intact corpse of a Medium or smaller creature that has been dead for no more than 1 day (time spent under effects like <em>gentle repose</em> don't count against this time), the fluid gives the corpse a rudimentary semblance of life, reactivating its nerves and muscle tissue. This causes the corpse to reanimate and shamble around erratically for 1 minute. The result is not an undead creature, nor is it a construct. The reanimated corpse remains utterly lifeless and is driven only by muscular spasms that cause it shuffle 20 feet in a random direction each round, gasping and blinking eerily as it goes. When the corpse hits a solid barrier or is attacked, it stops moving. On its next turn, roll 1d8 to determine where it goes next.

When exposed to a sudden influx of air, like that caused by falling, the cloak unfolds like a crude parachute. When falling, a creature wearing a billow cape is treated as if he had deliberately jumped from the height. When worn in areas of strong wind or greater, a billow cape hampers movement. In such wind conditions, the wearer treats all terrain as difficult terrain and takes a -4 penalty on Fly checks. Because of the strange and somewhat fragile construction of this cape, only Small or smaller billow capes function properly. Larger billow capes take all the penalties resulting from high winds, but grant none of the benefits when the wearer falls.

When wearing a signifer mask, the wearer is always treated as averting her gaze when dealing with gaze attacks, and she gains a +8 circumstance bonus on saving throws against vision-based effects. However, the obscuring nature of the mask means that the wearer also takes a -4 penalty on vision-based Perception checks while wearing the mask, and all opponents are treated as having concealment (20% miss chance).<br/><br/> A character with the Hellknight signifer prestige class can see through the mask as normal, but she can also adjust her mask as a standard action to function as detailed above. Signifer masks are often magically enhanced, becoming variants of items that take up the head item slot.

Any trap or creature attempting to damage an arm wearing a metal glove must break through the glove before reaching the wearer. Heavy objects that would normally crush the wearer's hand rest harmlessly on the glove instead, likely trapping the item but allowing her to pull her hand out as normal.

Anderos salve is a gray paste applied to the arms or chest that helps restore youthful vigor, while mulibrous tincture is a bitter, minty tea that eases pain and softens skin. If a dose of anderos salve is applied at least twice per week over a period of months, the user's feminine secondary sex characteristics are gradually reduced and masculine ones develop; imbibing mulibrous tincture in this way reduces the drinker's masculine secondary sex characteristics and feminine ones develop. Taking a dose of each concoction every week instead softens all secondary sex characteristics, causing the user to take on an androgynous appearance. After a period of 6 months, the transformation is permanent, with no further doses required to maintain the new form.<br/><br/> While these alchemical solutions do not cause as swift or extensive a change as magical alternatives, they are far more affordable, especially among the Rivethun, who often teach the process of their creation to their disciples.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":5,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Anderos Salve And Mulibrous Tincture","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"max":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"anderosSalveAndMulibrousTincture","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Remedies"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":700000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/unique-10.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"yPZUtoixfpvSJyfO","name":"Anesthetic Wine","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Adventurer's Armory 2 pg. 29</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 50 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1 lb.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Remedies</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>Description</h2>This alchemical anesthetic, developed from ancient recipes for Sarenite sacred wine, grants a powerful resistance to pain.

Drinking the antidote grants a +10 alchemical bonus on saving throws against that poison for 4 hours. If the imbiber succeeds at a saving throw with this bonus, she is automatically cured even if she would not normally be cured by successful saving throws or the number required to cure her has not been met yet.

In addition, the drinker loses all memory of events that transpired during the 1d4 minutes directly following consumption of a draught of icecap ale; a successful DC 20 Fortitude save negates this memory loss.

Nostalgia oil can also be thrown as a splash weapon, extending its benefits for 1 hour to any Pathfinder struck with a direct hit. Alternatively, a creature can mix it with a pint of lantern oil or piece of incense, which grants half the nostalgia oil's benefits to all Pathfinders within 20 feet of the lantern or censor for 1 hour; any strong wind (21+ mph) dissipates the aroma for 1 minute.<br/><br/> Crafting a vial of nostalgia oil requires a successful DC 25 Craft (alchemy) check.

If the patient is affected by an ongoing effect that can be resisted with a successful Fortitude save, he can attempt an immediate saving throw to end the effect (using the +2 alchemical bonus if applicable); this final benefit can be gained only once per day.<h2 class=\"framing\">Alchemical Recipe</h2><strong>Recipe</strong> (20 phosphorus + 60 ginger extract + 30 mugwort extract)/filtration; <strong>Craft</strong> 25<br/><strong>Time</strong> 10 minutes; <strong>Tools</strong> filter; <strong>Type</strong> alchemical remedy","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":85,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Vivifying Moxibustion Needles","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"max":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"vivifyingMoxibustionNeedles","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Remedies"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":7400000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/tools/fasteners/pin-spiked.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"opxR1KGu04w0VnDC","name":"War Spirit Pouch","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Advanced Race Guide pg. 165</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 1 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Alchemical Remedies</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>Description</h2>Tengus mix special salves to protect their feathers from the elements.

Creating a dose of antivenom requires a dose of the specific poison that the antivenom is designed to protect against.<br/><br/> <strong>Antivenom Effects</strong>: A single dose of antivenom automatically neutralizes the first exposure of the specific poison it is made to combat and provides a +8 alchemical bonus on saving throws against additional exposure to that specific poison; this bonus decreases by 1 every hour, until the effect ends after 8 hours.<br/><br/> <strong>Crafting Antivenom</strong>: To create a dose of antivenom, a living creature must first be exposed to a half dose of the poison in question. The creature suffers the poison's effects normally, except the saving throw DC to resist the poison is reduced by 2. In order to be able to produce antivenom, the creature must succeed at the necessary saving throws to be cured of the poison. If the poison's duration expires without the creature being cured, no antivenom can be harvested. Once the creature has resisted the poison's effects, a viable sample of the creature's blood can be extracted with a successful DC 20 Craft (alchemy) or Heal check. This blood must then be refined to extract the natural antibodies that combat the poison in a process that takes 1 hour and requires a successful Craft (alchemy) check (DC = 5 + the poison's saving throw DC). Success yields 1 dose of antivenom. Antivenom can also be harvested in the same fashion from a creature that has been afflicted by a full dose of poison, rather than a creature deliberately given a half dose for this purpose. Regardless of how much poison the creature is exposed to, the antibodies in its system can be harvested only for 24 hours after it has recovered from the poison.<br/><br/> <strong>Purchasing Antivenom</strong>: Antivenom is not particularly expensive, but because it is highly specialized, it can be difficult to find. A dose of antivenom has a market price equal to half the market price of a dose of the poison in question, but it is treated as though its price were five times the market price of the poison for the purposes of determining its availability in any given settlement. Alternatively, if 1 or more doses of the poison in question can be provided, most alchemists will supply as much antivenom as they can produce from the doses for a fee of 10% of the market price of the poison.<h2 class=\"framing\">Construction</h2><strong>Craft (Alchemy)</strong> DC varies","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"max":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"antivenom","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Alchemical Remedies"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"potion","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":10000000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf1/icons/items/potions/minor-blue.jpg","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}}],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":100001,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{"pf1":{"sellMultiplier":null},"core":{"sheetClass":"PF1.ActorSheetPFNPCLoot"}}}

The arms don't swing with sufficient force to cause damage, but you can practice your acrobatic technique by moving up to and around the pillar while the arms are in motion, attempting to avoid being tagged.

The entire contraption can be dismantled and stowed in a chest the size of a large foot locker for transport.<br/><br/> Using the pillar to hone your acrobatic techniques requires 1 hour of practice and a DC 20 Acrobatics check. If you succeed at the check, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to avoid attacks of opportunity provoked by moving out of or through an opponent's threatened area.

On a hit, an alchemical sling bullet shatters, affecting the target with the alchemical solution within. This deals only the splash weapon's damage (if any), not the damage a sling bullet would normally deal. This attack resolves against the target's normal AC (rather than touch AC) as with a standard sling bullet, and uses the sling's range. An alchemical sling bullet does not deal splash damage to squares adjacent to the target. If an attack roll with an alchemical sling bullet misses, the bullet and its alchemical contents are destroyed, and do not risk detonating in another square.<br/><br/> Filling an alchemical sling bullet is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and you must succeed at a DC 15 Craft (alchemy) or Sleight of Hand check to avoid spilling the alchemical item on yourself.

The sturdy container features a padded interior with numerous straps and compartments so that the items within aren't damaged in transport. The altar's surface prominently features a deity's holy symbol, and it's sturdy enough that it can support up to 300 pounds of weight, enough to serve as a makeshift pulpit.<br/><br/> Among the items found within the altar are the tools and materials necessary to perform not just ceremonies, but also jobs and professions the related deity deems sacred, as well as holy texts written to inspire greatness in the deity's followers. The user can expend some of the materials within the altar to gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the next Craft check of the specified type (see below).<br/><br/> In addition, after spending 1 hour praying and reading the holy scriptures within the altar, the user gains a +2 circumstance bonus on a single skill check. Which deity this altar is dedicated to determines the skill to which this bonus applies (see below). The user must attempt this skill check within an hour of praying and reading the altar's scriptures or lose the bonus-the mantras and inspiration provided by the texts having drifted from her mind. This hour of prayer and scripture reading can be integrated with the time a cleric uses to prepare her spells. Regardless, using the masterwork portable altar in this manner expends the altar's materials in the same way that using the normal altar to bolster a Craft check does.<br/><br/> A masterwork portable altar can be used multiple times, but after 20 uses, it must be restocked with 50 gp worth of sanctified materials-preferably purchased from a temple of the associated deity. The altar grants no bonuses on skill checks if used while its materials are depleted, though it can still be employed as a normal portable altar.<br/><br/> <table class=\"inner\"><tr><td><strong>Deity</strong></td><td><strong>Favored Craft</strong></td><td><strong>Aided Skill</strong></td><tr> <tr><td>Abadar</td><td>Craft (jewelry)</td><td>Appraise</td><tr> <tr><td>Asmodeus</td><td>Craft (calligraphy)</td><td>Diplomacy</td><tr> <tr><td>Calistria</td><td>Craft (traps)</td><td>Bluff</td><tr> <tr><td>Cayden Cailean</td><td>Craft (leather)</td><td>Ride</td><tr> <tr><td>Desna</td><td>Craft (clothing)</td><td>Perception</td><tr> <tr><td>Erastil</td><td>Craft (bows)</td><td>Survival</td><tr> <tr><td>Gorum</td><td>Craft (armor)</td><td>Intimidate</td><tr> <tr><td>Gozreh</td><td>Craft (ships)</td><td>Handle Animal</td><tr> <tr><td>Iomedae</td><td>Craft (armor)</td><td>Diplomacy</td><tr> <tr><td>Irori</td><td>Craft (books)</td><td>Acrobatics</td><tr> <tr><td>Lamashtu</td><td>Craft (traps)</td><td>Intimidate</td><tr> <tr><td>Nethys</td><td>Craft (books)</td><td>Spellcraft</td><tr> <tr><td>Norgorber</td><td>Craft (alchemy)</td><td>Stealth</td><tr> <tr><td>Pharasma</td><td>Craft (pottery)</td><td>Perception</td><tr> <tr><td>Rovagug</td><td>Craft (weapons)</td><td>Intimidate</td><tr> <tr><td>Sarenrae</td><td>Craft (weapons)</td><td>Heal</td><tr> <tr><td>Shelyn</td><td>Craft (any art)</td><td>Perform (any)</td><tr> <tr><td>Torag</td><td>Craft (stonemasonry)</td><td>Climb</td><tr> <tr><td>Urgathoa</td><td>Craft (alchemy)</td><td>Disguise</td><tr> <tr><td>Zon-Kuthon</td><td>Craft (locks)</td><td>Stealth</td><tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></tr></table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":40,"price":400,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"altarPortableMasterwork","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"sort":500000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/tools/laboratory/alembic-glass-ball-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"b8smiWXeJX9IjYCC","name":"Anchoring balloon","type":"loot","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>People of the Stars pg. 19</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 300 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 25 lbs.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Tools</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>Description</h2>An anchoring balloon is a single-use alchemical device designed to provide a standing platform on a gaseous planet.

A single Pnakotic record focuses on a single subject within the confnes of a single Knowledge skill, such as a presentation on the nature of deep one religious practices in worshiping Cthulhu (Knowledge [religion]), the mechanics of a shoggoth's biology (Knowledge [dungeoneering]), or the methods of creating portals between worlds (Knowledge [arcana]). By studying a Pnakotic record for 8 hours, a reader can attempt a single Knowledge check of the appropriate type when researching the book's corresponding subject to gain a +10 circumstance bonus on the check.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":10,"price":2000,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"pnakoticRecord","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Tools"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"gear","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"sort":11700000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/sundries/books/book-symbol-lightning-silver-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"WIpiFjjdPvnrydCI","name":"Poison belcher","type":"loot","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Alchemy Manual pg. 6</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 50 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> 1/2 lb.<br/><strong>Category</strong> Tools</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>Description</h2>Loading this long bronze tube with a dose of ingested poison and 10 gp worth of gold dust is a standard action.

title=\"PFS Legal\"/>Description</h2>The caravan master's wagon is similar in most respects to a high-quality heavy smuggler's wagon (see below), but it additionally allows for a hidden <em>portable hole</em> (price not included above) secreted within in it. The <em>portable hole</em> rests upon the surface of the wagon bed, with a second layer of wooden planks laid atop it and fastened into place with nuts and bolts so they appear to be a normal part of the wagon. Thus the <em>portable hole</em> sits between the layers of wood like a thin cut of meat between two slices of bread. Those who know about the <em>portable hole</em> can fill it with illicit goods and then fasten the second layer of decking in place and load normal cargo atop it.

Her confirmation that the legendary drow were in fact real drove the elves of Kyonin-who had maintained the secret of the drow's existence for millennia-to attempt to bribe the Decemvirate into recalling and altering the book. The Society didn't relent, however, making the existence of dark elves a widely accepted fact within only a few years' time.

An observer must succeed at a DC 30 Perception check to recognize an assembled burglar's torc for what it is; if the observer handles the torc, the DC for this check decreases to 15.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":5,"price":2102,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":""},"range":{"value":null,"units":"","maxIncrements":1,"minValue":null,"minUnits":""},"uses":{"value":0,"per":null,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1","maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"max":0},"measureTemplate":{"type":"","size":"","overrideColor":false,"customColor":"","overrideTexture":false,"customTexture":""},"attackName":"","actionType":null,"attackBonus":"","critConfirmBonus":"","damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"attackParts":[],"formulaicAttacks":{"count":{"formula":"","value":null},"bonus":{"formula":""},"label":null},"formula":"","ability":{"attack":null,"damage":null,"damageMult":1,"critRange":20,"critMult":2},"save":{"dc":0,"type":"","description":""},"effectNotes":[],"attackNotes":[],"soundEffect":"","powerAttack":{"multiplier":"","damageBonus":2,"critMultiplier":1},"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"burglarsTorc","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Black Market"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","attack":{"parts":[]}},"sort":2400000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/equipment/neck/amulet-round-gold-green-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"Ku0SUAdDJGILqZPe","name":"Clear Ear","type":"consumable","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Adventurer's Armory pg. 19</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 15 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Black Market</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>Description</h2>This green gel is poured into the user's ear and takes effect 2 hours later, enhancing senses and memory but increasing irritability.

Taking refined pesh gives a person 15 temporary hit points for 1 hour, a +2 morale bonus on saves versus fear effects for 1 day, and a -4 penalty to Dexterity and Wisdom for 1 day. Pesh is addictive (Fortitude DC 10 to resist), and long-term users suffer Dexterity and Wisdom damage. <h2 class=\"framing\">False Pesh</h2> <em>Dark Markets - A Guide to Katapesh pg. 14</em><br/> False pesh looks much the same as real pesh, but the genuine plant is a spined cactus that grows in desert areas, while the imposter is a sticky, more bulbous plant that requires extra moisture to flourish. A character can make a DC 15 Knowledge (nature) check to tell the real plant from the fake.<br/><br/> Imitation raw pesh formed from the false pesh plant is much harder to differentiate from the real drug. Both appear as milky white, cheese-like blocks; the false pesh has a milder odor and a stickier gloss to its surface, but the differences are minor. A DC 25 Alchemy check discerns true raw pesh from false.<br/><br/> Anyone ingesting false raw pesh must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 10 minutes.

A dose of animal repellent makes a plant creature smell unappetizing for 24 hours. Animals do not attempt to consume a plant creature coated in animal repellent if there are other food sources available, and in combat prefer to use natural attacks that are not bite attacks against such a creature if they can.

This price assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and have the spell cast at her convenience (generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to prepare the spell in question, though you may be lucky enough to find someone who has it prepared that day or a spontaneous caster who knows it). If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell (for example, to cast <em>dispel magic </em>on a magical seal in a dungeon) you need to negotiate with her; the default answer to such requests is typically no, since most people don't actually like to go on unexpected life-threatening adventures.<br/><br/> The price given is for any spell that does not require a costly material component. If the spell includes a material component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell. If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell.<br/><br/> If a spell has dangerous consequences (such as <em>contact other plane</em>, which has a risk of decreasing the caster's Intelligence and Charisma), the spellcaster will certainly require proof that you can and will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to cast such a spell, which isn't certain). If these additional costs put the total spellcasting price above 3,000 gp, the spell is not generally available.<br/><br/> In the case of spells that transport the caster and characters over a distance, you will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell (one for the caster to take you there and one for the caster to return), even if you aren't returning with the caster.<br/><br/> Not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to a small town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd-level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4thlevel spells, a large city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells. Even a metropolis isn't guaranteed to have a local spellcaster able to cast 9th-level spells.","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":0,"price":0,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Service, Spellcasting","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"serviceSpellcasting","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Lodging/Services"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"tradeGoods","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"sort":2900000,"flags":{},"img":"icons/environment/people/cleric-orange.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"dmvRvlO4CbqsxgbR","name":"Service, Valet","type":"loot","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Equipment pg. 99</em><br/><strong>Price</strong> 1 gp; <strong>Weight</strong> -<br/><strong>Category</strong> Lodging/Services</p><h2 class=\"framing\"><img src=\"https://www.aonprd.com/images/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" style=\"margin:3px 3px 0px 3px;\" title=\"PFS Legal\"/>Description</h2>This title includes valets, butlers, lady's maids, ladies-inwaiting, secretaries, stewards, concierges, majordomos, manservants, bodyservants, and other skilled, trusted servants and employees who work closely with an employer or run a household or business, sometimes without direct supervision.
