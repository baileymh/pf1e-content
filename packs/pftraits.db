Perhaps you've donated much of your personal wealth or time to serving the church, or you're the child of a powerful or well-loved member of the church, an orphan raised by the church, or a foundling with a strange birthmark that bears more than a passing resemblance to your faith's holy symbol. The faith has long supported you, and you are eager to repay the church in some way. In Katapesh, the establishment of a new village is always cause for interest to the nation's churches, as establishing new temples in villages is an excellent way to expand upon the church's resources and bring in more faithful. If the Pactmasters' plans to revitalize and rebuild Kelmarane are successful, the village will need a temple, and your faith is keenly interested in being represented there. This campaign trait is particularly suited to worshipers of Sarenrae, as Kelmarane was founded near an old monastery dedicated to the Dawnflower, and reconsecrating that monastery is of great interest to Sarenrae's church. Furthermore, a temple dedicated to her once stood in Kelmarane itself, but it has long since fallen into ruin; whispers among the religion tell that the church's old pastor may have fallen from grace and may even have been part of the cause of the hard times that befell the village.

You owe your sanity and your life to a woman named Haleen. She could be your sister or merely a childhood companion, but whatever your relationship to her, she took care of you and protected you. She's always been a part of your life, and although her temper often kept her from making friends or keeping a job, she's always been kind to you. Haleen was instrumental in securing your freedom from slavery or making sure you got a good apprenticeship or job in society,but recently, she'd been growing strangely morose and depressed. You and Haleen normally kept no secrets, but whatever was bothering her wasn't something she shared with you. One night, she vanished, leaving you a brief note, begging you to forget her and to get on with your life, but something about the note bothered you,something in the way she phrased her words struck you as forced. You may be convinced she'd been kidnapped, forced to leave against her will, or even magically controlled, but you also suspect that she left you to protect you from something,that was ever her way. You're now convinced that it's time for you to step in and protect her, but you had no idea where she may have gone until recently. Several months have passed since she disappeared, and you've spent those months searching for clues to her location, and you've finally found a lead,a mysterious note, a strange dream, the result of a back-alley divination, or a report of a sighting of a woman matching Haleen's description has come to you, placing Haleen in the vicinity of an old ghost town named Kelmarane. What she's doing there and how she came to be there makes no sense to you yet, but the lead is the strongest one you've had.
