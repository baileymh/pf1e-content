A medium wagon can carry up to 2,000 pounds of cargo and requires four Medium or two Large creatures to pull it.<br/><br/> <em>Heavy Wagon</em>: Wagons of this type are large, fourwheeled vehicles primarily used in caravans to transport goods over long stretches of territory. A heavy wagon carries up to 4,000 pounds of cargo, and is pulled by either eight Medium creatures or four Large creatures.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":0.02,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Passage, Wagon (medium)","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"passageWagonMedium","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Transport, Land"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"misc","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br/><br/> <strong>Black Cumin</strong>: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Flaming Sumac</strong>: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease's effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Golden Cardamom</strong>: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual's body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Striped Nutmeg</strong>: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Sunrise Cinnamon</strong>: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Tiger Cloves</strong>: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br/><br/> <strong>Violet Salt</strong>: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body's water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":30,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"spiceGoldenCardamom","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Food/Drink"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

This price assumes that you can go to the spellcaster and have the spell cast at her convenience (generally at least 24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to prepare the spell in question, though you may be lucky enough to find someone who has it prepared that day or a spontaneous caster who knows it). If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a spell (for example, to cast <em>dispel magic </em>on a magical seal in a dungeon) you need to negotiate with her; the default answer to such requests is typically no, since most people don't actually like to go on unexpected life-threatening adventures.<br/><br/> The price given is for any spell that does not require a costly material component. If the spell includes a material component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell. If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add 1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell.<br/><br/> If a spell has dangerous consequences (such as <em>contact other plane</em>, which has a risk of decreasing the caster's Intelligence and Charisma), the spellcaster will certainly require proof that you can and will pay for dealing with any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even agrees to cast such a spell, which isn't certain). If these additional costs put the total spellcasting price above 3,000 gp, the spell is not generally available.<br/><br/> In the case of spells that transport the caster and characters over a distance, you will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell (one for the caster to take you there and one for the caster to return), even if you aren't returning with the caster.<br/><br/> Not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to a small town (or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a spellcaster capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for 2nd-level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4thlevel spells, a large city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or 8th-level spells.

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br/><br/> <strong>Black Cumin</strong>: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Flaming Sumac</strong>: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease's effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Golden Cardamom</strong>: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual's body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Striped Nutmeg</strong>: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Sunrise Cinnamon</strong>: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Tiger Cloves</strong>: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br/><br/> <strong>Violet Salt</strong>: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body's water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":5,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"spiceVioletSalt","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Food/Drink"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br/><br/> <strong>Black Cumin</strong>: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Flaming Sumac</strong>: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease's effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Golden Cardamom</strong>: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual's body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Striped Nutmeg</strong>: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Sunrise Cinnamon</strong>: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Tiger Cloves</strong>: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br/><br/> <strong>Violet Salt</strong>: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body's water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":25,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"spiceTigerCloves","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Food/Drink"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br/><br/> <strong>Black Cumin</strong>: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Flaming Sumac</strong>: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease's effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Golden Cardamom</strong>: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual's body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Striped Nutmeg</strong>: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Sunrise Cinnamon</strong>: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Tiger Cloves</strong>: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br/><br/> <strong>Violet Salt</strong>: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body's water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":20,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"spiceFlamingSumac","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Food/Drink"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br/><br/> <strong>Black Cumin</strong>: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Flaming Sumac</strong>: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease's effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Golden Cardamom</strong>: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual's body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Striped Nutmeg</strong>: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Sunrise Cinnamon</strong>: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Tiger Cloves</strong>: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br/><br/> <strong>Violet Salt</strong>: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body's water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":15,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"spiceSunriseCinnamon","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Food/Drink"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br/><br/> <strong>Black Cumin</strong>: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Flaming Sumac</strong>: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease's effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Golden Cardamom</strong>: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual's body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Striped Nutmeg</strong>: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Sunrise Cinnamon</strong>: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Tiger Cloves</strong>: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br/><br/> <strong>Violet Salt</strong>: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body's water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":15,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"spiceBlackCumin","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Food/Drink"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

Inserted into a corpse's heart, lungs, and other organs, the needles can be well hidden inside a slain body with a minute of work and a Sleight of Hand check-the result of this Sleight of Hand check determines the Heal check DC to notice the use of quieting needles on a corpse. This Heal check gains a cumulative +1 bonus for each day the body has been allowed to decay, as the presence of the needles grows increasingly obvious as the flesh rots away.<br/><br/>A body pierced with quieting needles can be brought back to life as normal via <em>raise dead</em>, but upon being restored to life, the victim immediately begins suffering from the fact that his major organs are perforated by hidden needles. This grisly fate can even strike someone brought back to life via <em>resurrection</em> or <em>true resurrection</em> if the body itself was intact and the needles were thus hidden. (Casting <em>resurrection</em> or <em>true resurrection</em> with only a fragment of the body or no body, forcing the spell to rebuild the body as appropriate, is a surefire way to avoid having the victim come back to life with the needles still inside him.)<br/><br/>A creature brought back to life with quieting needles inside him is immediately struck with pain and must make a DC 25 Fortitude save each round to avoid being nauseated from the pain and suffering 1d6 points of Constitution damage. A successful Fortitude save negates the nauseated condition and reduces the Constitution damage to 1.<br/><br/>Removing quieting needles from a dead body takes 1d6+6 rounds (and a DC 20 Heal check if the process is to leave the body in a condition where <em>raise dead</em> is still viable). Removing quieting needles from a freshly restored living body causes 2d6 points of damage per round the procedure continues, with a successful DC 25 Heal check reducing damage caused that round to 2.<br/><br/>The use of quieting needles is relatively uncommon, meant as much to punish enemies for attempting to raise dead allies and force them to waste the resources on such expensive magic as well as to cause the restored creature agonizing pain-using quieting needles is an evil act that is as illegal as murder in most civilized regions.<br/><br/>A set of quieting needles costs 25 gp.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":25,"size":"med","equipped":false,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"Quieting needles","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"tag":"quietingNeedles","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Black Market"}},"scriptCalls":[],"subType":"tradeGoods","extraType":"","uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}

After importing plants from across the planes, Qadiran druids and alchemists bred and magically adapted unique species with enhanced medicinal properties. Al-Zabriti tribes generally have supplies of the following spices on hand. To gain the benefits of these spices, a character must consume multiple doses over 1 or more days, as indicated for each spice. Once the benefit is gained, continued consumption at that rate maintains the benefit.<br/><br/> <strong>Black Cumin</strong>: Cumin is a nutty seasoning used in savory foods. If eaten twice per day for a week, it grants those who consume it a +1 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves to resist disease for the following 24 hours. An ounce of black cumin sells for 15 gp and seasons 14 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Flaming Sumac</strong>: A tart spice, sumac allows a character who contracts a natural disease with multiple effects to suffer one fewer effect (determined randomly) each time he fails a saving throw to resist that disease's effects. An individual must consume flaming sumac twice per day for at least 3 days to gain its effects, which last for 24 hours after the last dose is consumed. An ounce of flaming sumac sells for 20 gp and seasons six meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Golden Cardamom</strong>: This fragrant, sweet powder is made from ground cardamom seeds and is often used as a perfume and tooth cleaner, as well as a seasoning in rice dishes and desserts. When a character takes ability damage from a disease, the actual damage taken is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). Golden cardamom has no effect on ability drain or other effects caused by disease. It must be eaten once per day for 9 days to build up sufficiently within an individual's body to provide this effect. An ounce of golden cardamom seeds sells for 30 gp and seasons nine meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Striped Nutmeg</strong>: Used for both desserts and meats, nutmeg halves any ability damage (but not ability drain) resulting from non-supernatural disease, to a minimum damage of 1. It must be eaten three times per day for at least 4 days to provide this effect. An ounce of ground striped nutmeg sells for 100 gp and seasons 12 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Sunrise Cinnamon</strong>: A warming spice, sunrise cinnamon is used for seasoning both sweet and savory foods. It promotes sweating, and a character who ingests it twice per day for 5 days gains a +4 alchemical bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of hot environments. An ounce of ground sunrise cinnamon sells for 15 gp and seasons 10 meals.<br/><br/> <strong>Tiger Cloves</strong>: Cloves are used in both sweet and savory foods, brewed into teas, and chewed as a breath freshener. When chewed for 1 minute, a dose of tiger cloves removes nauseated or sickened conditions caused by disease or poison effects. When used to season a meal, a dose of tiger cloves grants a +2 alchemical bonus on saving throws to resist the nauseated or sickened conditions for 24 hours after the meal is eaten. A single dose of tiger cloves sells for 25 gp and seasons one meal.<br/><br/> <strong>Violet Salt</strong>: Salt is of vital importance for retaining a body's water. If a dose of Qadiran violet salt is consumed as part of a meal, it grants a +4 alchemical bonus on Constitution checks to resist the effects of ongoing thirst for the next 24 hours. A dose of violet salt sells for 5 gp and seasons one meal.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"quantity":1,"weight":{"value":0},"price":100,"size":"med","equipped":true,"resizing":false,"identified":true,"hp":{"max":10,"value":10},"broken":false,"hardness":0,"carried":true,"unidentified":{"price":0,"name":""},"identifiedName":"","cl":0,"aura":{"custom":false,"school":""},"actions":[],"uses":{"per":null,"value":0,"maxFormula":"","pricePerUse":0,"autoDeductCharges":true,"autoDeductChargesCost":"1"},"attackNotes":[],"effectNotes":[],"links":{"children":[],"charges":[]},"tag":"spiceStripedNutmeg","useCustomTag":false,"flags":{"boolean":{},"dictionary":{"Category":"Food/Drink"}},"scriptCalls":[],"consumableType":"misc","showInQuickbar":false,"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""},"unchainedAction":{"activation":{"cost":1,"type":""}},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"actionType":null,"ability":{"damageMult":1,"critMult":2},"attack":{},"range":{"maxIncrements":1}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0},"flags":{}}
