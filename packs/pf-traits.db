There are so many to choose from, and they&rsquo;re all so glamorous, rich, and successful! Wouldn&rsquo;t it be amazing to, perhaps some day, meet one of them? Or even better, to be a Kintargan celebrity yourself? Your interest in one of Kintargo&rsquo;s celebrities could be completely benign, with the NPC acting as a muse, inspiration, or role model for you that you used to guide many life choices leading you to this day. Or perhaps your interest is more akin to an obsession, in which you hope to some day live a life like that you imagine your idol lives, or perhaps even to some day meet and become friends (or perhaps more than friends) with your idol. Keep in mind, though, that sometimes a celebrity&rsquo;s public persona and real personality are two very different things, and if some day you were to meet your idol, you might be surprised at the truth! That said, the fact that, by all accounts, your idol has been missing since House Thrune instituted martial law has you worried; you hope he or she is all right! The fact that all five of the local legends listed below have been rumored to have ties to the Silver Ravens further concerns you, considering how that group seems to have been particularly targeted by Barzillai Thrune&rsquo;s agents over the past week. The fate of all five of these Kintargan icons will be revealed at some point during the Hell&rsquo;s Rebels Adventure Path, but keep in mind that some of those fates might not be pleasant discoveries for you!</span></p></em>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n<p><span id=\"ctl00_MainContent_DataListTypes_ctl00_LabelType\">You gain a +1 trait bonus on Knowledge (local) checks.

Such adventurers are known as much for their flair and panache as their martial prowess, and the daring bravo&rsquo;s equipment is often ornately ornamented or personalized. This equipment package is good for a bard, fighter, rogue, swashbuckler, or vigilante. Certain cavaliers, investigators, skalds, or even paladins may also find it appealing.

This equipment package is well-suited to a cleric, inquisitor, paladin, warpriest, or even a fighter with a religious background. It&rsquo;s especially suited to characters who focus on supporting their party members and making them more effective in a fight. Even more than with other equipment packages, the GM should consider substituting the masterwork longsword in this package with a masterwork melee weapon appropriate to the PC&rsquo;s faith. If the PC can cast spells, add a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Armor</strong>: Heavy steel shield, masterwork breastplate.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Weapons</strong>: Cold iron morningstar, heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork longsword.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Combat Gear</strong>: Alchemist&rsquo;s fire (3), holy water (4), <em>oil of bless weapon</em>, <em>potions of cure light wounds</em> (2), <em>potion of protection from evil</em>, sunrods (3).</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Other Gear</strong>: Backpack, bedroll, belt pouch, candles (5), chalk (5 pieces), crowbar, flint and steel, holy symbol (silver), mess kit, sack, silk rope (50 ft.), trail rations (5 days), waterskin, 7 gp.</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Total Weight</strong>: 102 lbs.
