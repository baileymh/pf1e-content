The following are broad categories of firearm rarity and the rules that govern them. Pathfinder&rsquo;s world of Golarion uses the rules for emerging guns, which is also the default category of gun rarity detailed in this Pathfinder RPG supplement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>No Guns</h2>\n<p>If you do not want guns in your campaign, simply don&rsquo;t allow the rules that follow. The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game plays perfectly well without them. Very Rare Guns: Early firearms are rare; advanced firearms, the gunslinger class, the Amateur Gunslinger feat, and archetypes that use the firearm rules do not exist in this type of campaign. Firearms are treated more like magic items&mdash;things of wonder and mystery&mdash;rather than like things that are mass-produced. Few know the strange secrets of firearm creation.</p>\n<p>Only NPCs can take the Gunsmithing feat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Emerging Guns</h2>\n<p>Firearms become more common. They are mass-produced by small guilds, lone gunsmiths, dwarven clans, or maybe even a nation or two&mdash;the secret is slipping out, and the occasional rare adventurer uses guns. The baseline gunslinger rules and the prices for ammunition given in this chapter are for this type of campaign. Early firearms are available, but are relatively rare. Adventurers who want to use guns must take the Gunsmithing feat just to make them feasible weapons. Advanced firearms may exist, but only as rare and wondrous items&mdash;the stuff of high-level treasure troves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Commonplace Guns</h2>\n<p>While still expensive and tricky to wield, early firearms are readily available. Instead of requiring the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat, all firearms are martial weapons. Early firearms and their ammunition cost 25% of the amounts listed in this book, but advanced firearms and their ammunition are still rare and cost the full price to purchase or craft.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Guns Everywhere</h2>\n<p>Guns are commonplace. Early firearms are seen as antiques, and advanced firearms are widespread. Firearms are simple weapons, and early firearms, advanced guns, and their ammunition are bought or crafted for 10% of the cost listed in this chapter. The gunslinger loses the gunsmith class feature and instead gains the gun training class feature at 1st level.</p>"}

Everything else is cosmetic at this point&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s slashing damage or fire damage, makes a target sickened or confused, grants an insight bonus on saves or an enhancement bonus on attack rolls, or looks like unicorns or fire demons.

Often they require some form of magic item, like a bag of holding, for such a feat to work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The process of making a vermin into a familiar grants it an Intelligence score and removes the mindless trait. Vermin familiars communicate with their masters and other vermin of their kind (greensting scorpions with other scorpions, house centipedes with other centipedes, and scarlet spiders with other spiders) by way of a strange combination of behaviors, slight changes in coloration, and even the excretion of scents, subtle and otherwise. As with other types of familiars, other creatures cannot understand this communication without magical aid.</p>"}

Except in special cases, a spell does not affect the way another spell operates. Whenever a spell has a specif ic effect on other spells, the spell description explains that effect. Several other general rules apply when spells or magical effects operate in the same place:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stacking Effects</h2>\n<p>Spells that provide bonuses or penalties on attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and other attributes usually do not stack with themselves. More generally, two bonuses of the same type don&rsquo;t stack even if they come from different spells (or from effects other than spells; see Bonus Types, above).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Different Bonus Types</h2>\n<p>The bonuses or penalties from two different spells stack if the modifiers are of different types. A bonus that doesn&rsquo;t have a type stacks with any bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Same Effect More than Once in Different Strengths</h2>\n<p>In cases when two or more identical spells are operating in the same area or on the same target, but at different strengths, only the one with the highest strength applies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Same Effect with Differing Results</h2>\n<p>The same spell can sometimes produce varying effects if applied to the same recipient more than once. Usually the last spell in the series trumps the others. None of the previous spells are actually removed or dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell in the series lasts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>One Effect Makes Another Irrelevant</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, one spell can render a later spell irrelevant. Both spells are still active, but one has rendered the other useless in some fashion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Multiple Mental Control Effects</h2>\n<p>Sometimes magical effects that establish mental control render each other irrelevant, such as spells that remove the subject&rsquo;s ability to act. Mental controls that don&rsquo;t remove the recipient&rsquo;s ability to act usually do not interfere with each other. If a creature is under the mental control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If the controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the competing controllers must make opposed Charisma checks to determine which one the creature obeys.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spells with Opposite Effects</h2>\n<p>Spells with opposite effects apply normally, with all bonuses, penalties, or changes accruing in the order that they apply. Some spells negate or counter each other. This is a special effect that is noted in a spell&rsquo;s description.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Instantaneous Effects</h2>\n<p>Two or more spells with instantaneous durations work cumulatively when they affect the same target.</p>"}

Not only do dungeon explorers face the danger of being crushed by tons of falling rock, but even if they survive they might be buried beneath a pile of rubble or cut off from the only known exit. A cave-in buries anyone in the middle of the collapsing area, and then sliding debris damages anyone in the periphery of the collapse. A typical corridor subject to a cave-in might have a bury zone with a 15-foot radius and a 10-foot-wide slide zone extending beyond the bury zone. A weakened ceiling can be spotted with a DC 20 Knowledge (engineering) or DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry) check. Remember that Craft checks can be made untrained as Intelligence checks. A dwarf can make such a check if he simply passes within 10 feet of a weakened ceiling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A weakened ceiling might collapse when subjected to a major impact or concussion. A character can cause a cavein by destroying half the pillars holding up the ceiling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Characters in the bury zone of a cave-in take 8d6 points of damage, or half that amount if they make a DC 15 Reflex save. They are subsequently buried. Characters in the slide zone take 3d6 points of damage, or no damage at all if they make a DC 15 Reflex save. Characters in the slide zone who fail their saves are buried.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Characters take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while buried.

In 1 minute, using only her hands, a character can clear rocks and debris equal to five times her heavy load limit. The amount of loose stone that fills a 5-foot-by-5-foot area weighs 1 ton (2,000 pounds). Armed with an appropriate tool, such as a pick, crowbar, or shovel, a digger can clear loose stone twice as quickly as by hand. A buried character can attempt to free himself with a DC 25 Strength check.</p>"}

Siege Engine Details}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 158</em></p>\n<p>All siege engines are at least size Large devices and often much larger. Unless stated otherwise in an individual siege engine description, all siege engines use the following rules.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Proficiency</h2>\n<p>Siege engines are exotic weapons. A creature with the Siege Engineer feat is proficient with all siege engines, including siege firearms. A creature that is proficient in firearms is also proficient in siege firearms, but not other siege engines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crew</h2>\n<p>The sheer size of a siege engine often necessitates a crew for its use. One person of that crew is the crew leader. Usually the crew leader targets or controls the movement of a siege engine; sometimes the crew leader does both. Often the crew leader is required to take actions and make specific checks in order for a siege engine to function. The rest of the crew members are required to spend actions and make checks in order for a siege engine to function.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The number of members in a crew assumes Medium creatures. A ram can be crewed by Small creatures, but it takes double the crew to do the same job. If Large or larger creatures serve as crew members, each Large creature counts as four crew members, a Huge creature counts as eight Medium creatures, a Gargantuan creature counts as 16 Medium creatures, and a Colossal creature counts as 20 Medium creatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magical and Masterwork Siege Engines</h2>\n<p>Siege engines can be masterwork, increasing their Craft DC by 5 and costing an additional 300 gp. A masterwork siege engine can be enchanted at twice the cost for a normal magical weapon. The enhancement bonus of a siege engine applies on attack rolls and targeting checks (in the case of indirect ranged siege engines), and in the case of magical siege engines, the enhancement bonus also applies on damage rolls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Defense and Hit Points</h2>\n<p>All siege engines are objects. A siege engine has a Dexterity of 0 (&ndash;5 penalty) and a further penalty based on its size. Each type of siege engine has its own hardness and hit points. Siege engines can be armored&mdash;treat the siege engine as a creature of its size to determine the cost of the armor. Masterwork siege engine armor can be enchanted for twice the normal cost to enchant armor. Armored siege engines have an armor bonus equal to that normally granted by the specific armor (shields have no effect on a siege engine), a hardness and hit points equal to that of the armor, and bonus hit points equal to the armor bonus &times; 5.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Moving Siege Engines</h2>\n<p>Siege engines have a speed. The speed of a siege engine is the distance it can be moved if its full crew makes a move action to move it. Some siege engines have a speed of 0. If this is the case, the engine must be dissembled before movement is possible, or else mounted on a vehicle. Siege engines that are atop or mounted on vehicles move with those vehicles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ranged Attacks</h2>\n<p>Unlike normal ranged weapons, siege engines do not deal half damage when attacking objects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Critical Hits</h2>\n<p>When a direct-fire siege engine or a close assault siege engine scores a critical hit, it confirms the critical and deals critical hit damage just like any other weapon. If an indirect-fire ranged siege engine rolls a natural 20 on its targeting check, it can also score a critical hit. The crew leader must reroll the targeting check to confirm the critical. If the confirmation targeting check is successful, the attack is a critical hit, and the siege engine multiplies its damage by its critical multiplier. Unlike normal attacks, siege engines attacks can deal critical hit damage to objects. Siege engines do not gain the benefit of critical feats the crew or the crew leader may have.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mishaps and Misfires</h2>\n<p>Rolling a natural 1 on an attack roll or a targeting check made by an indirect-fire ranged siege engine produces a mishap. Usually a mishap applies the broken condition. A non-firearm siege engine with the broken condition takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls, targeting checks, and damage rolls. It also moves at half its normal speed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the creature that serves as crew leader has the Siege Engineer feat, that creature does not generate a mishap on a natural 1 when firing the siege engine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Firearm siege weapons do not gain a mishap on a natural 1, but instead have a misfire value, like other firearms do. An attack roll or targeting check that falls within the misfire range causes the firearm siege engine to misfire. A misfire always misses, and applies the broken condition to the siege engine firearm. A firearm siege weapon with the broken condition takes all of the penalties and limitations that non-firearm siege engines do, and the misfire range of the firearm siege engine is increased by 4. If the firearm siege engine already has the broken condition when it misfires, it explodes. When a firearm siege engine explodes, it deals its damage to all creatures within a blast range (those within the blast can attempt a DC 20 Reflex save for half damage). The normal misfire range of a firearm siege engine and its blast range are given in the individual firearm siege engine description. Crew leaders with the Siege Engineer feat do not lower the misfire value of firearm siege engines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Constructing and Repairing Siege Engines</h2>\n<p>A siege engine is a complex device requiring a DC 20 Craft (siege engine) skill check to build or repair.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Disabling Siege Engines</h2>\n<p>A siege engine is considered a difficult device to disable, requiring 2d4 rounds of effort and a DC 20 Disable Device check to do so. When a siege engine is disabled, it either doesn&rsquo;t work or is sabotaged and stops working 1d4 minutes after use. Fixing a disabled siege engine requires a DC 20 Craft (siege engine), Disable Device, or Knowledge (engineering) check. It takes 10 minutes to fix the device, and the check can be retried if the fix fails.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Assembling Siege Engines</h2>\n<p>Siege engines are broken down for transport and can be reassembled on the battlefield, requiring the time and number of workers noted below. Each assembly worker must make a DC 10 Craft (siege engine) check; if untrained, they may not take 10. Assembly can be performed with at least half the required number of workers by doubling the time required. If fewer than half are available, the weapon cannot be assembled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 3-11: Siege Engine Assembly</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 97.8065%; height: 112px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.1768%; height: 16px;\">Engine Size</td>\n<td style=\"width: 32.4538%; height: 16px;\">Time Required</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.1055%; height: 16px;\">Workers Required</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.1768%; height: 16px;\">Small</td>\n<td style=\"width: 32.4538%; height: 16px;\">1 minute</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.1055%; height: 16px;\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.1768%; height: 16px;\">Medium</td>\n<td style=\"width: 32.4538%; height: 16px;\">10 minutes</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.1055%; height: 16px;\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.1768%; height: 16px;\">Large</td>\n<td style=\"width: 32.4538%; height: 16px;\">1 hour</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.1055%; height: 16px;\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.1768%; height: 16px;\">Huge</td>\n<td style=\"width: 32.4538%; height: 16px;\">2 hours</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.1055%; height: 16px;\">6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.1768%; height: 16px;\">Gargantuan</td>\n<td style=\"width: 32.4538%; height: 16px;\">4 hours</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.1055%; height: 16px;\">8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.1768%; height: 16px;\">Colossal</td>\n<td style=\"width: 32.4538%; height: 16px;\">8 hours</td>\n<td style=\"width: 40.1055%; height: 16px;\">12</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

Magic Item Creation}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 490</em></p>\n<p>A scroll is a spell (or collection of spells) that has been stored in written form. A spell on a scroll can be used only once. The writing vanishes from the scroll when the spell is activated. Using a scroll is basically like casting a spell. The price of a scroll is equal to the level of the spell &times; the creator&rsquo;s caster level &times; 25 gp. If the scroll has a material component cost, it is added to the base price and cost to create. Table 15&ndash;15 gives sample prices for scrolls created at the lowest possible caster level for each spellcasting class. Note that some spells appear at different levels for different casters. The level of such spells depends on the caster scribing the scroll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>A scroll is a heavy sheet of fine vellum or high-quality paper. An area about 8-1/2 inches wide and 11 inches long is sufficient to hold one spell. The sheet is reinforced at the top and bottom with strips of leather slightly longer than the sheet is wide. A scroll holding more than one spell has the same width (about 8-1/2 inches) but is an extra foot or so long for each additional spell. Scrolls that hold three or more spells are usually fitted with reinforcing rods at each end rather than simple strips of leather. A scroll has AC 9, 1 hit point, hardness 0, and a break DC of 8.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To protect it from wrinkling or tearing, a scroll is rolled up from both ends to form a double cylinder. (This also helps the user unroll the scroll quickly.) The scroll is placed in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood. Most scroll cases are inscribed with magic symbols which often identify the owner or the spells stored on the scrolls inside. The symbols sometimes hide magic traps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Activation</h2>\n<p>To activate a scroll, a spellcaster must read the spell written on it. This involves several steps and conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Decipher the Writing</h2>\n<p>The writing on a scroll must be deciphered before a character can use it or know exactly what spell it contains. This requires a read magic spell or a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level). Deciphering a scroll is a full-round action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Deciphering a scroll to determine its contents does not activate its magic unless it is a specially prepared cursed scroll. A character can decipher the writing on a scroll in advance so that she can proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use the scroll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Activate the Spell</h2>\n<p>Activating a scroll requires reading the spell from the scroll. The character must be able to see and read the writing on the scroll. Activating a scroll spell requires no material components or focus. (The creator of the scroll provided these when scribing the scroll.) Note that some spells are effective only when cast on an item or items. In such a case, the scroll user must provide the item when activating the spell. Activating a scroll spell is subject to disruption just as casting a normally prepared spell would be. Using a scroll is like casting a spell for purposes of arcane spell failure chance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To have any chance of activating a scroll spell, the scroll user must meet the following requirements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The spell must be of the correct type (arcane or divine). Arcane spellcasters (wizards, sorcerers, and bards) can only use scrolls containing arcane spells, and divine spellcasters (clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers) can only use scrolls containing divine spells. (The type of scroll a character creates is also determined by his class.)</li>\n<li>The user must have the spell on her class list.</li>\n<li>The user must have the requisite ability score.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the user meets all the requirements noted above, and her caster level is at least equal to the spell&rsquo;s caster level, she can automatically activate the spell without a check. If she meets all three requirements but her own caster level is lower than the scroll spell&rsquo;s caster level, then she has to make a caster level check (DC = scroll&rsquo;s caster level + 1) to cast the spell successfully. If she fails, she must make a DC 5 Wisdom check to avoid a mishap (see Scroll Mishaps). A natural roll of 1 always fails, whatever the modifiers. If the caster level check fails but no mishap occurs, the scroll is not expended. Activating a scroll is a standard action (or the spell&rsquo;s casting time, whichever is longer) and it provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as casting a spell does.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Determine Effect</h2>\n<p>A spell successfully activated from a scroll works exactly like a spell prepared and cast the normal way. Assume the scroll spell&rsquo;s caster level is always the minimum level required to cast the spell for the character who scribed the scroll, unless the scriber specif ically desired otherwise.</p>\n<p>The writing for an activated spell disappears from the scroll as the spell is cast.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Scroll Mishaps</h2>\n<p>When a mishap occurs, the spell on the scroll has a reversed or harmful effect. Possible mishaps are given below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A surge of uncontrolled magical energy deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level to the scroll user.</li>\n<li>Spell strikes the scroll user or an ally instead of the intended target, or a random target nearby if the scroll user was the intended recipient.</li>\n<li>Spell takes effect at some random location within spell range.</li>\n<li>Spell&rsquo;s effect on the target is contrary to the spell&rsquo;s normal effect.</li>\n<li>The scroll user suffers some minor but bizarre effect related to the spell in some way. Most such effects should last only as long as the original spell&rsquo;s duration, or 2d10 minutes for instantaneous spells.</li>\n<li>Some innocuous item or items appear in the spell&rsquo;s area.</li>\n<li>Spell has delayed effect. Sometime within the next 1d12 hours, the spell activates. If the scroll user was the intended recipient, the spell takes effect normally. If the user was not the intended recipient, the spell goes off in the general direction of the original recipient or target, up to the spell&rsquo;s maximum range, if the target has moved away.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 15-15: Scrolls</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 65.7078%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15.5803%;

Benefits of Harmful Conditions}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 95</em></p>\n<p>The following is a list and descriptions of many of the most common minor spellblights.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Caster Blank</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster with caster blank has a hard time focusing her spells or spell-like abilities on the same creature more than once. After targeting a creature with a spell, the caster cannot target that creature again with a spell until caster blank is removed or suppressed. To suppress caster blank, the afflicted spell caster must spend a standard action concentrating, which shakes off all effects of the caster blank until she casts a targeted spell again. Caster blank only affects spells that target creatures, and a spellcaster can still affect the creature with area spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Caster blank can be cured by any effect that removes confusion or insanity. Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this spellblight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Caster Croak</h2>\n<p>The afflicted spellcaster&rsquo;s throat or mouth is magically constricted. The spellcaster can barely make her words heard, and then only with great effort. A creature under this affect can only make itself heard by others by spending a swift action to focus its will on speech. Casting spells with a verbal component has a 20% chance of spell failure, and the save DCs of any spells she casts with the language-dependent descriptor are reduced by 4. Spell-like abilities are not affected by this spellblight because they lack verbal components. Shouting and screaming is impossible while the creature is affected by this spellblight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A heal spell or similar effect cures this spellblight, as does casting the shout spell, though doing so is still affected by the spellblight&rsquo;s effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Confounded Casting</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster with confounded casting has a mental disconnect between the spells she intends to cast and the spells she actually casts. The first time on her turn that she casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she makes a concentration check with a DC of 15 + twice the level of the spell being cast. If the concentration check fails, the caster must pick another spell or spell-like ability of the same level or lower to cast with the same casting time. If the spellcaster has no other spell or spell-like ability, the action is lost. The spell or spell-like ability she originally picked is not spent and she can attempt to cast that spell again later.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Confounded casting is cured by any effect that removes confusion or insanity. Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this spellblight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Disassociation</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster with disassociation lapses into a mild insanity in which she dissociates her identity and starts to perceive herself as someone else. While subject to disassociation, a spellcaster is incapable of using spells or effects with a range of personal or of targeting herself with a spell effect. A spell with an area that includes her but does not need targeted individual creatures functions normally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Disassociation can by cured by any effect that removes confusion or insanity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ebon Eyes</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster with ebon eyes develops a jet-black film over her eyes, which inverts her capacity to perceive light and darkness. The creature treats darkness as bright light, dim light as normal light, normal light as dim light, and bright light as darkness. The ebon eyes protect against blinding, dazzling, patterns, or other visual effects, granting a +2 bonus on all saving throws against those effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ebon eyes can be removed with an effect that removes blindness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Eldritch Ague</h2>\n<p>Eldritch ague manifests itself as a sickness that is debilitating to spellcasters. A spellcaster with this spellblight is sickened until the curse is removed. When the subject of the curse casts a spell, she is overcome with shaking for 1 round, requiring any spellcasting or the use of a spell-like ability during that time to succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level of the spell being cast). If she fails the save, the spell and the action to cast it is lost.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While a curse, eldritch ague acts much like a disease, and creatures with immunity to disease are also immune to eldritch ague. Remove disease cures eldritch ague; unlike with most spellblights, using this spell to remove the spellblight does not impose a &ndash;5 caster level check penalty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hemoculysis</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster with hemoculysis bleeds from her eyes whenever she casts a spell. The volume and duration of this flow depends on the level of the spell, lasting 1 round per level of the spell. While bleeding from the eyes, the spellcaster is considered dazzled and takes 1 point of bleed damage. Casting additional spells while the eyes are already bleeding resets the duration of existing hemoculysis by the spell level, provided it&rsquo;s greater than the current duration. The sight of the spellcaster&rsquo;s eyes bleeding is horrifying, and she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidate checks and a &ndash;4 penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks for the duration of the bleeding.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hemoculysis can be cured by heal or regenerate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lassitude</h2>\n<p>Whenever a spellcaster with this spellblight casts a spell, she must make a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level of the spell being cast). If she fails the check, the spellcaster takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per spell level (or 1 point of nonlethal damage when casting a 0-level spell or 1 point per 2 caster levels if using a spell-like ability). This nonlethal damage cannot be reduced in any way so long as the spellcaster suffers from lassitude.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lassitude can be cured by lesser restoration, restoration, or any effect that completely removes exhaustion. Simply resting has no effect. Creatures immune to nonlethal damage are immune to this spellblight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ritualistic Obsession</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster afflicted with ritualistic obsession adds unnecessary gestures to her spellcasting activities. Any spell without a somatic component (even a spell cast with the Still Spell feat) now requires one, and any spell that already has a somatic component requires two free hands rather than one. Spell-like abilities now require a somatic component. The extra complexity increases swift action casting times to a standard action, standard action casting times to 1 round, and 1 round casting times to 2 rounds. Other casting times are not increased. The extra focus does serve to increase the efficacy of the caster&rsquo;s spells. All save DCs for spells and spell-like abilities that have their casting time increased with ritualistic obsession are increased by 1.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ritualistic obsession is cured by any effect that removes insanity. Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to ritualistic obsession.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Addiction</h2>\n<p>A spell addict feeds off the elation of wielding magic, but suffers rapid withdrawal once spellcasting ends. After successfully casting a spell, the addict gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws until her next turn. On any round the spell addict does not cast a spell on her turn, however, she goes into withdrawal, and is sickened until her next turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spell addiction is cured by any effect that removes confusion, insanity, or disease. Creatures that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to spell addiction.</p>"}

Each construct has a purchase price and a crafting cost, along with a list of requirements and the skills used to create them. Some require special materials in addition to the cost for basic crafting supplies, generally for the construct&rsquo;s body. Special material costs increase both the purchase price and the crafting cost of the construct.</p>\n<p>The DC to craft a construct is 5 + the default caster level of the construct, just like for a magic item. Like when crafting magic items, a creator with a sufficiently high skill bonus may ignore these requirements. Each missing requirement increases the Craft DC by 5. Regardless, the creator must meet all item creation feats and minimum caster level requirements. Crafting a construct takes 1 day per 1,000 gp in the item&rsquo;s base price, excluding any special material costs.</p>\n<p>This process is identical to the process for crafting a magic item, including the rules for accelerating creation and handling interruptions.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.IX8Xif3UBwvGZoTL]{7.1.4.1.

The three categories of desert terrain are tundra (cold desert), rocky deserts (often temperate), and sandy deserts (often warm).</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.meSI5igDtER7aVBn]{3.2.6.1. Sandstorms}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tundra differs from the other desert categories in two important ways. Because snow and ice cover much of the landscape, it&rsquo;s easy to find water. During the height of summer, the permafrost thaws to a depth of a foot or so, turning the landscape into a vast field of mud. The muddy tundra affects movement and skill use as the shallow bogs described in Marsh Terrain, although there&rsquo;s little standing water.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The table below describes terrain elements found in each of the three desert categories. The terrain elements on this table are mutually exclusive; for instance, a square of tundra might contain either light undergrowth or an ice sheet, but not both.</p>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"height: 112px; width: 74.2428%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 49.262%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 50.3691%; height: 16px;\" colspan=\"3\" scope=\"col\">Desert Category</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 49.262%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.0812%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Tundra</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.8672%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Rocky</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.4207%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Sandy</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 49.262%; height: 16px;\">Light undergrowth</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.0812%; height: 16px;\">15%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.8672%; height: 16px;\">5%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.4207%; height: 16px;\">5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 49.262%; height: 16px;\">Ice sheets</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.0812%; height: 16px;\">25%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.8672%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.4207%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 49.262%; height: 16px;\">Light rubble</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.0812%; height: 16px;\">5%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.8672%; height: 16px;\">30%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.4207%; height: 16px;\">10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 49.262%; height: 16px;\">Dense rubble</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.0812%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.8672%; height: 16px;\">30%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.4207%; height: 16px;\">5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 49.262%; height: 16px;\">Sand dunes</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.0812%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.8672%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.4207%; height: 16px;\">50%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<h2>Light Undergrowth</h2>\n<p>Consisting of scrubby, hardy bushes and cacti, light undergrowth functions as described for other terrain types.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ice Sheet</h2>\n<p>The ground is covered with slippery ice. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square covered by an ice sheet, and the DC of Acrobatics checks there increases by 5. A DC 10 Acrobatics check is required to run or charge across an ice sheet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Light Rubble</h2>\n<p>Small rocks are strewn across the ground, making nimble movement more difficult. The DC of Acrobatics checks increases by 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dense Rubble</h2>\n<p>This terrain feature consists of more and larger stones. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square with dense rubble. The DC of Acrobatics checks increases by 5, and the DC of Stealth checks increases by 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sand Dunes</h2>\n<p>Created by the action of wind on sand, dunes function as hills that move. If the wind is strong and consistent, a sand dune can move several hundred feet in a week&rsquo;s time. Sand dunes can cover hundreds of squares. They always have a gentle slope pointing in the direction of the prevailing wind and a steep slope on the leeward side.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Other Desert Terrain Features</h2>\n<p>Tundra is sometimes bordered by forests, and the occasional tree isn&rsquo;t out of place in the cold wastes. Rocky deserts have towers and mesas consisting of flat ground surrounded on all sides by cliffs and steep slopes (as described in @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.B5qjfHf1pFgEA7bg]{3.2.5. Mountain Terrain}). Sandy deserts sometimes have quicksand; this functions as described in Marsh Terrain, although desert quicksand is a waterless mixture of fine sand and dust. All desert terrain is crisscrossed with dry streambeds (treat as trenches 5 to 15 feet wide) that fill with water on the rare occasions when rain falls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stealth and Detection in the Desert</h2>\n<p>In general, the maximum distance in desert terrain at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 6d6 &times; 20 feet; beyond this distance, elevation changes and heat distortion in warm deserts makes sight-based Perception impossible. The presence of dunes in sandy deserts limits spotting distance to 6d6 &times; 10 feet. The scarcity of undergrowth or other elements that offer concealment or cover makes using Stealth more difficult.</p>"}

Magic Item Creation}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 491</em></p>\n<p>A staff is a long shaft that stores several spells. Unlike wands, which can contain a wide variety of spells, each staff is of a certain kind and holds specific spells. A staff has 10 charges when created.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>A typical staff measures anywhere from 4 feet to 7 feet long and is 2 inches to 3 inches thick, weighing about 5 pounds. Most staves are wood, but an exotic few are bone, metal, or even glass. A staff often has a gem or some device at its tip or is shod in metal at one or both ends. Staves are often decorated with carvings or runes. A typical staff is like a walking stick, quarterstaff, or cudgel. It has AC 7, 10 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 24.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Activation</h2>\n<p>Staves use the spell trigger activation method, so casting a spell from a staff is usually a standard action that doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the spell being cast has a longer casting time than 1 standard action, however, it takes that long to cast the spell from a staff.) To activate a staff, a character must hold it forth in at least one hand (or whatever passes for a hand, for nonhumanoid creatures).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Special Qualities</h2>\n<p>Roll d%. A 01&ndash;30 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides some clue to the staff &rsquo;s function, and 31&ndash;100 indicates no special qualities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Using Staves</h2>\n<p>Staves use the wielder&rsquo;s ability score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against their spells. Unlike with other sorts of magic items, the wielder can use his caster level when activating the power of a staff if it&rsquo;s higher than the caster level of the staff.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This means that staves are far more potent in the hands of a powerful spellcaster. Because they use the wielder&rsquo;s ability score to set the save DC for the spell, spells from a staff are often harder to resist than those from other magic items, which use the minimum ability score required to cast the spell. Not only are aspects of the spell dependent on caster level (range, duration, and so on) potentially higher, but spells from a staff are also harder to dispel and have a better chance of overcoming a target&rsquo;s spell resistance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Staves hold a maximum of 10 charges. Each spell cast from a staff consumes one or more charges. When a staff runs out of charges, it cannot be used until it is recharged. Each morning, when a spellcaster prepares spells or regains spell slots, he can also imbue one staff with a portion of his power so long as one or more of the spells cast by the staff is on his spell list and he is capable of casting at least one of the spells. Imbuing a staff with this power restores one charge to the staff, but the caster must forgo one prepared spell or spell slot of a level equal to the highest-level spell cast by the staff. For example, a 9th-level wizard with a staff of fire could imbue the staff with one charge per day by using up one of his 4th-level spells. A staff cannot gain more than one charge per day and a caster cannot imbue more than one staff per day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, a staff can hold a spell of any level, unlike a wand, which is limited to spells of 4th level or lower. The minimum caster level of a staff is 8th.</p>"}

Vermin companions follow the same rules as animal companions, advancing their Hit Dice and other abilities per the animal companion base statistics table. Vermin companions can be trained as if they were animals using the Handle Animal skill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mindless:</strong> Vermin companions have no Intelligence score and possess the mindless trait. In spite of this, vermin companions may learn one trick, plus additional bonus tricks. If a vermin animal companion gains an ability score increase (at 4 Hit Dice, 8 Hit Dice, and so on), the druid can apply this increase to the companion's Intelligence, changing it from &mdash; to 1, at which point the companion loses the mindless quality and is able to know up to 3 tricks per point of Intelligence, plus the additional bonus tricks. Vermin companions have no skill points or feats as long as they have the mindless quality.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Trip</strong>: Because many vermin have multiple limbs, they are very difficult to trip. As a result, a CMD entry has been included for each, indicating the bonus to CMD such vermin receive against trip attacks.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.3ovmfxSd9xrbw1n5]{Eurypterid}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.DSrlTqY0EQiv3hu7]{Giant Ant}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.jOOjynWbgkafpDTQ]{Giant Assassin Bug}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.kQADV3NZBImk77QK]{Giant Beetle}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.ON3lPEFm1wHZ8GLN]{Giant Caterpillar}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.PalYgqKfnMj9BgWc]{Giant Centipede}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.CTRzv8eNNM7gNcYY]{Giant Cockroach}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.uvHHPgsk8vsD2iaz]{Giant Crab}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.NWkx3nCuPjrmfcS5]{Giant Dragonfly}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.FI9UVtPoURAgBs3d]{Giant Leech}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.KydnfsYxEQKqBhw3]{Giant Locust}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.hmNhw7ZFlTyrM8Bi]{Giant Mantis}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.AneYpTO9krD90Tml]{Giant Mantis Shrimp}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.i5ZL81oxd0jbISRZ]{Giant Mosquito}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.wfa2SiJ3xgHaspto]{Giant Scorpion}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.O7zwDUnK1fVhKY12]{Giant Slug}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.yPFepyTDniAzwLg7]{Giant Solifugid}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.zTaz6ChnBuJCwh9t]{Giant Spider}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.2w6OtWKz2ADigas3]{Giant Termite}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.Vcv76BEfI7eqMS56]{Giant Wasp}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.KdQcpfADC8Q7mboC]{Giant Whiptail Centipede}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-companions.E2bw3ELvajWCKEdD]{Web Tyrant Spider}</p>"}

You can only bull rush an opponent who is no more than one size category larger than you. A bull rush attempts to push an opponent straight back without doing any harm. If you do not have the Improved Bull Rush feat, or a similar ability, initiating a bull rush provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your attack is successful, your target is pushed back 5 feet. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent&rsquo;s CMD you can push the target back an additional 5 feet. You can move with the target if you wish but you must have the available movement to do so. If your attack fails, your movement ends in front of the target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An enemy being moved by a bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity because of the movement unless you possess the Greater Bull Rush feat. You cannot bull rush a creature into a square that is occupied by a solid object or obstacle. If there is another creature in the way of your bull rush, you must immediately make a combat maneuver check to bull rush that creature. You take a &ndash;4 penalty on this check for each creature being pushed beyond the first. If you are successful, you can continue to push the creatures a distance equal to the lesser result. For example, if a fighter bull rushes a goblin for a total of 15 feet, but there is another goblin 5 feet behind the first, he must make another combat maneuver check against the second goblin after having pushed the first 5 feet. If his check reveals that he can push the second goblin a total of 20 feet, he can continue to push both goblins another 10 feet (since the first goblin will have moved a total of 15 feet).</p>"}

You don&rsquo;t get this higher Strength bonus, however, when using a light weapon with two hands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Multiplying Damage</h2>\n<p>Sometimes you multiply damage by some factor, such as on a critical hit. Roll the damage (with all modifiers) multiple times and total the results.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Note</h2>\n<p>When you multiply damage more than once, each multiplier works off the original, unmultiplied damage.

All of the vehicle&rsquo;s saving throws (Fortitude, Reflex, and Will) have the same value. This is the vehicle&rsquo;s save before the driver modifies it with his driving check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Maximum Speed</h2>\n<p>This is the fastest that a vehicle can move. When a vehicle has more than one method of propulsion, it may also have more than one maximum speed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>CMB and CMD</h2>\n<p>The CMB an CMD before the driver modifies it with his driving check modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Acceleration</h2>\n<p>This is how fast a vehicle can increase its speed each round. It also determines the maximum amount a vehicle can safely decelerate each round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Propulsion</h2>\n<p>The type and amount of propulsion required.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Driving Check</h2>\n<p>The skills typically used to make a vehicle driving check with this vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Forward Facing</h2>\n<p>The direction of the vehicle&rsquo;s forward facing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Driving Device</h2>\n<p>The typical driving device the driver manipulates when driving the vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Driving Space</h2>\n<p>The size and the location of the vehicle&rsquo;s driving space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crew</h2>\n<p>This is the number of crew members, in addition to the driver, needed to move the vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Decks</h2>\n<p>The number of decks and any important information about those decks is given in this section.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weapons</h2>\n<p>Some vehicles can be equipped with siege weapons.

When making a melee attack against a target that isn&rsquo;t adjacent to you, use the rules for determining concealment from ranged attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, some magical effects provide concealment against all attacks, regardless of whether any intervening concealment exists.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Concealment Miss Chance</h2>\n<p>Concealment gives the subject of a successful attack a 20% chance that the attacker missed because of the concealment.

You can&rsquo;t attack an opponent that has total concealment, though you can attack into a square that you think he occupies.

Although invisibility provides total concealment, sighted opponents may still make Perception checks to notice the location of an invisible character. An invisible character gains a +20 bonus on Stealth checks if moving, or a +40 bonus on Stealth checks when not moving (even though opponents can&rsquo;t see you, they might be able to figure out where you are from other visual or auditory clues).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Varying Degrees of Concealment</h2>\n<p>Certain situations may provide more or less than typical concealment, and modify the miss chance accordingly.</p>"}

Whenever a character gains a level in his favored class, he receives either + 1 hit point or + 1 skill rank. The choice of favored class cannot be changed once the character is created, and the choice of gaining a hit point or a skill rank each time a character gains a level (including his first level) cannot be changed once made for a particular level.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.tbAP08jcSWONo1KU]{Prestige Classes} can never be a favored class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Racial Favored Class Bonus</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Advanced Player's Guide pg. 8</em></p>\n<p>The final section for each racial discussion describes alternative benefits for members of that race taking certain classes as a favored class. The normal benefit of having a favored class is simple and effective: your character gains one extra hit point or one extra skill rank each time she gains a level in that class (or in either of two classes, if she is a half-elf ). The alternate favored class abilities listed here may not have as broad an appeal as the standard choices. They are designed to reflect flavorful options that might be less useful in general but prove handy in the right situations or for a character with the right focus. Most of them play off racial archetypes, like a half-orc&rsquo;s toughness and proclivity for breaking things or elven grace and finesse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In most cases, these benefits are gained on a level-by-level basis&mdash;your character gains the specified incremental benefit each time she gains a level. Unless otherwise noted, these benefits always stack with themselves. For example, a human with paladin as a favored class may choose to gain 1 point of energy resistance each time she gains a level; choosing this benefit twice increases this resistance bonus to 2, 10 times raises it to 10, and so on.</p>\n<p>In some cases this benefit may eventually hit a fixed numerical limit, after which selecting that favored class benefit has no effect. Of course, you can still select the bonus hit point or skill rank as your favored class benefit, so there is always a reward for sticking with a favored class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, some of these alternate favored class benefits only add +1/2, +1/3, +1/4, or +1/6 to a roll (rather than +1) each time the benefit is selected; when applying this result to the die roll, round down (minimum 0). For example, a dwarf with rogue as his favored class adds +1/2 to his trap sense ability regarding stone traps each time he selects the alternate rogue favored class benefit; though this means the net effect is +0 after selecting it once (because +1/2 rounds down to +0), after 20 levels this benefit gives the dwarf a +10 bonus to his trap sense (in addition to the base value from being a 20th-level rogue).</p>\n<p>As in the previous section, what is presented here is a set of alternative benefits that characters of each race may choose instead of the normal benefits for their favored class. Thus, rather than taking an extra hit point or an extra skill rank, players may choose for their characters to gain the benefit listed here. This is not a permanent or irrevocable choice; just as characters could alternate between taking skill ranks and hit points when they gain levels in their favored class, these benefits provide a third option, and characters may freely alternate between them.</p>\n<p>As with any alternate or optional rule, consult with your GM to determine whether exchanging normal favored class benefits for those in this chapter will be allowed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

As a result, creating a precise map of the plane is next to impossible, despite the presence of landmarks. In addition, certain spells, such as shadow conjuration and shadow evocation, modify the base material of the Shadow Plane. The utility and power of these spells within the Shadow Plane make them particularly useful for explorers and natives alike.</li>\n<li><strong>Mildly Neutral-Aligned</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Magic</strong>: Spells with the shadow descriptor are enhanced on the Shadow Plane. Furthermore, specific spells become more powerful on the Shadow Plane. Shadow conjuration and shadow evocation spells are 30% as powerful as the conjurations and evocations they mimic (as opposed to 20%). Greater shadow conjuration and greater shadow evocation are 70% as powerful (not 60%), and a shades spell conjures at 90% of the power of the original (not 80%). Despite the dark nature of the Shadow Plane, spells that produce, use, or manipulate darkness are unaffected by the plane.</li>\n<li><strong>Impeded Magic:</strong> Spells with the light descriptor or that use or generate light or fire are impeded on the Shadow Plane. Spells that produce light are less effective in general, because all light sources have their ranges halved on the Shadow Plane.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Denizens</h2>\n<h3>D&rsquo;ziriaks</h3>\n<p>Despite the perpetually dim nature of the Shadow Plane, it supports a surprising variety of life. Several types of plants have developed within the shadows, all of them eerie, twisted, and colorless reflections of species found on the Material Plane. Likewise, animals suited to the darkness prowl the plane, from shadows and shadow mastiffs to gloomwings, umbral dragons, tenebrous worms, and various nightshades. Sentient species also make their home on the Shadow Plane, but few are welcoming to visitors from other realities. The unusual nature of d&rsquo;ziriak society combines with their appearances&mdash;something between humanoid and termite, with elaborate luminescent patterns across their bodies&mdash; to unsettle most outsiders. These colorful exoskeletons are strangely unaffected by the Shadow Plane&rsquo;s penumbral gloom. D&rsquo;ziriaks maintain a complex social structure, most of it hidden within their extensive, partially underground cities lit through a combination of alchemical and illusory lighting and the creatures&rsquo; own natural bioluminescence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Fetchlings</h3>\n<p>Descendants of humans that were long ago trapped on the Shadow Plane, fetchlings are perhaps the most familiar Shadow Plane denizens to those on the Material Plane. They are a distinctive species, exceptionally slender and bleached of most natural coloring beyond pale yellow eyes, but many fetchlings value extraplanar pigments to dye their hair in striking colors when visiting other worlds (such colors remain muted in their home plane). They are among the most populous of the plane&rsquo;s residents, establishing humanoid settlements far and wide&mdash;often overlapping with Material Plane counterparts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Kyton Demagogues</h3>\n<p>Many kytons have their own divine leaders. The nine kyton demagogues maintain their own realms on the Shadow Plane, known as sanctuaries, ranging from meeting spaces to mind-shattering mazes to an exhibition of the culmination of kyton artistry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Owbs</h3>\n<p>The mysterious owbs, floating humanoid torsos draped in shadows darker than those of the plane around them, are the least understood of the Shadow Plane&rsquo;s denizens. Rarely encountered, their only relations with other races are their ties to the caligni and dark folk of the Material Plane, to whom they appear as divine guides. The most disturbing legends speak to the possibility that the owbs may be all that remains of a long-forgotten pantheon of demigods&mdash;a pantheon that may be gathering power once again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Shadow Giants</h3>\n<p>Shadow giants roam the reaches of their vast territories, eschewing permanent settlements in favor of a nomadic lifestyle. They typically gather into familial units, traveling and hunting in these tight-knit groups, but different families are known to join together into larger tribes in times of war. With a reputation as fierce warmongers, shadow giants are rightfully feared and respected by many of the plane&rsquo;s other denizens, but more than one traveler has found that the right combination of deference and battle prowess can win their respect and fair treatment in return. Most, however, prefer simply to keep to their own settlements and stay out of the nomads&rsquo; paths.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Shaes</h3>\n<p>Shaes encountered on the Material Plane wear masks and garments that give a discrete form to their shadowy bodies. Among their own kind, however, they dispense with such accommodations, defaulting to their unfixed forms of pure shadowstuff. They maintain one city on the Shadow Plane as their homeland, and in many ways they exhibit typical humanoid social structures. An overwhelming sense of racial pride, however, limits their interactions with outsiders, and few non-shaes are allowed within their elegant citadel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Svartalfars</h3>\n<p>A race of fey remarkable in that they are native to the Shadow Plane, svartalfars were long ago exiled here from the Fey World. In the countless ages since, they have formed into powerful clans of assassins, hiring their services to anyone who can pay the esoteric fees they demand&mdash;typically arcane secrets, occult lore, and obscure information about the Fey World. No one has ever catalogued the number of vast underground libraries the svartalfars maintain hidden away throughout the Shadow Plane, though certain groups, fearing that the creatures are planning a terrible revenge upon those who forced them out, would pay dearly to learn more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Velstracs (Kytons)</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most widely-known (and certainly the most notorious) denizens of the Shadow Plane, the vicious kytons (or velstracs, as they call themselves) have made the Shadow Plane their home since they were exiled eons ago from the reaches of Hell. Their demigod leaders&mdash;demagogues&mdash; maintain their realms here, while others of their kind take up residence nearby or in isolated communes where they strive to perfect themselves and their chosen torments. Countless velstracs practice their arts on the souls of those damned to the Midnight Lord.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Wayangs</h3>\n<p>Only a few elusive wayangs remain on the Shadow Plane, as the majority of their kind ventured through a series of breaches to the Material Plane only to become trapped there forever. A handful have since managed to find their way back to the Shadow Plane in the ages since, finding themselves as isolated and alone here as they had been on the Material Plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Divinities</h2>\n<p>Kyton demagogues</p>"}

If your final CR is 0 or lower, add features until you get a CR of 1 or higher.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Trap</h2>\n<p>For a spell trap or magic device trap, the base CR is 1.

If the trap is designed to deal damage over a number of rounds, multiply this value by the number of rounds the trap will be active (or the average number of rounds, if the duration is variable). Use this value to adjust the Challenge Rating of the trap, as indicated on @JournalEntry[Uqw50un84WFTPdQF]{3.1.3. Designing a Trap}.

Reviving and Replacing Companions}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Adventuring is a dangerous career, and sometimes an animal companion, cohort, or familiar dies or is lost. a change in your alignment or religion might drive away your cohort, or the cohort&rsquo;s role in the story might end based on discussion between you and the GM. An extended voyage in a dangerous environment might convince a druid to free a trusted companion that would otherwise suffer and die if forced to travel (such as a polar bear in the desert). a ranger might discover a rare specimen of a favorite type of creature and want to claim it as his own in order to protect it from poachers. Regardless of the cause, when a companion dies or is lost, you need to replace it. This creates an opportunity for roleplaying.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Reviving a Dead Companion</h2>\n<p>A lost animal companion, cohort, familiar, or follower can be raised or resurrected with spells such as raise dead, resurrection, or true resurrection. For a cohort or follower with character levels, these kinds of spells give the character one or more negative levels&mdash;a price worth paying if the alternative is death. Creatures with no character levels (such as animal companions and familiars) count as 1st level for the purpose of these spells, and therefore they take Constitution drain instead of negative levels. a non-sentient companion is assumed to be willing to return to life unless you were cruel to it or directly responsible for its death.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In most cases, the companion probably remembers its last moments alive and understands that you&rsquo;re the reason why it is alive again. For a lower-level cohort or a non-adventuring follower, the gift of a second chance at life is something very treasured and earns you great respect and devotion. You can gain the reputation of &ldquo;fairness and generosity&rdquo; for the purposes of the Leadership feat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Using reincarnate is an alternative option, but has a similar effect on a companion&rsquo;s loyalty and affection. Few humans would choose to be reincarnated as a bugbear or kobold, but if the choice is that or death, a new life in a new body is generally preferred. For an animal companion, the GM should create a random table of creatures similar to its original form&mdash;for example, a lion might be reincarnated as a leopard, cheetah, or tiger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Finding a Replacement</h2>\n<p>In some cases, replacing an animal companion or familiar can be as easy as purchasing an animal of the desired type and declaring it your new companion. Attuning a familiar to its new master requires a ritual. Choosing an animal companion requires 24 hours of prayer. The ceremony can also be used to attract and bond with an animal appropriate to the local environment. However, you might want to wait for the campaign to present an appropriate companion, such as an animal you rescue from a cruel enemy that you tame with the ritual or ceremony. In terms of game mechanics, there is no difference between any of these options, and you should work with the GM to find a replacement method that is appropriate to the campaign.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Replacing a lost or killed cohort or follower involves a similar collaboration between you and the GM to create a character who is appropriate for the campaign and valuable to you (and hopefully to the rest of the party). You might want to elevate a follower to a cohort, select another known NPC to become a cohort, or start from scratch by introducing a new NPC to the party. Keep in mind that your Leadership score might have changed, especially if you were responsible for the previous cohort&rsquo;s death&mdash;and that sort of tragedy creates roleplaying opportunities for the new cohort.</p>"}

A dueling counter is similar to a counterspell, but is easier to use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When a dueling opponent tries to cast a spell, the targeted spellcaster can make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell&rsquo;s level) as a free action. If the check succeeds, she identifies her opponent&rsquo;s spell and can attempt a dueling counter. If it fails, she cannot attempt a dueling counter against that spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A dueling counter is an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. To attempt a dueling counter, the countering duelist must expend a spell or a spell slot of a level equal to or higher than that of the spell being cast. Note that characters who cast spells spontaneously (such as bards and sorcerers) must choose what exact spell they are using to counterspell in addition to the slot being used. The countering duelist must then make a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the spell&rsquo;s caster level. Unlike when using a true counterspell action (which requires a readied action), even expending an exact copy of the spell being cast does not guarantee success. The caster attempting the counterspell receives a bonus or penalty on her check depending upon the level of the spell slot expended and the exact spell used, as noted in Table 2&ndash;3. If the check is successful, the spell is countered&mdash;it is negated and the spell is lost. If not, the spell happens as normal and the duelist attempting to counter the spell takes a &ndash;2 penalty on any saving throws made against the spell&rsquo;s effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a spellcaster can use dispel magic or dispel magic, greater as a dueling counter. When a dueling spellcaster does so, she does not need to identify the spell being cast, can counter a spell of any level, and must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 11 + the spell&rsquo;s caster level. When dispel magic is used as a dueling counter, it is not modified by any of the circumstances in Table 2&ndash;3.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because readying to counterspell is its own action, a participant can choose to ready to counterspell and make a dueling counter in the same round. This is only useful if the participant is facing multiple opponents or someone with access to Quickened Spell or other abilities that allow casting two spells in the same round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 2-3</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 70.1315%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8028%;\" scope=\"col\">Circumstance</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.464%;\" scope=\"col\">Check Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8028%;\">Spell is of a different school</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.464%;\">-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8028%;\">Spell is of the same school, but not the same spell</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.464%;\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8028%;\">Spell is a higher level than the spell being countered</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.464%;\">+1 per level higher</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 68.8028%;\">Spell is the same as the spell being countered</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.464%;\">+10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

The entire process is a matter of comparing the new spell you&rsquo;re creating to other spells and evaluating whether your spell is weaker, stronger, or about the same as that spell or group of spells. Designing a spell requires a firm understanding of all the game&rsquo;s rules, not just those related to spells. Furthermore, it requires an understanding of some unwritten game assumptions, most of which are discussed throughout this section.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Example: If you look at the spell list in the Core Rulebook, you&rsquo;ll notice that there isn&rsquo;t a 1st-level wizard spell that deals sonic damage. You may decide to design a spell to fill that niche, modeling it after burning hands, except dealing sonic damage instead of fire&mdash;perhaps you&rsquo;d call it sonic screech. However, there&rsquo;s a reason there aren&rsquo;t as many sonic spells in the game: &ldquo;sonic&rdquo; as an energy type is a late addition to the rules, and very few monsters have any resistance to sonic damage because most monsters existed before &ldquo;sonic&rdquo; was defined as an energy type. Because there are fewer creatures with sonic resistance than creatures with fire resistance, sonic screech will almost always be a better spell than burning hands. That means if you introduce sonic screech into your game, you&rsquo;ll see savvy players selecting it instead of burning hands. If a new spell displaces an existing spell from the roster of most spellcasters, it probably means it&rsquo;s better than the other available choices&mdash;and if it&rsquo;s so good that it&rsquo;s obviously the best spell choice, it&rsquo;s probably overpowered. Understanding the entire system of rules can help you avoid mistakes like this.</p>"}

Unless a construct suffers some sort of structural damage that radically alters its physical form, the construct continues to function at its full efficiency, and only falls apart once reduced to 0 hit points. Ideally, however, a construct should see some repair before it reaches that point. The make whole or rapid repair spells provide the easiest way to keep a construct in good condition. Both spells repair damaged constructs, even magic-immune ones like golems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Failing that, a crafter can repair a construct with the Craft Construct feat. When repairing a construct, its master spends 100 gp per Hit Die of the construct, and then makes a skill check as if he were crafting the construct with a DC of 5 less than the DC for crafting that construct. With a success, the construct regains 1d6 hit points per Hit Die of the construct. Completing a repair takes 1 day per 1,000 gp spent on the repair (minimum of 1 day). Repair in this way can only be performed while the construct is inanimate or nonfunctioning. At any time, a construct&rsquo;s creator can deactivate a construct under his control with a touch and a standard action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A construct that has been completely destroyed cannot be repaired, though at the GM&rsquo;s option some of the materials may be usable in the construction of a new construct. Additionally, some constructs have special means of repair, usually involving spells related to the golem&rsquo;s nature (such as the use of acid damage to heal a clay golem.)</p>"}

If the wordcaster boosts the target word, this wordspell more closely resembles fireball, dealing damage in a 20-foot-radius burst. The targets receive a Ref lex saving throw to halve the damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Selected Ice Blast Life Leech (magus 6, sorcerer/wizard 6, witch 6)</h2>\n<p>This wordspell causes the target to take 10d6 points of cold damage and 1d4 temporary negative levels, and to become entangled for 1d4 rounds. The target receives either a Fortitude save or a Ref lex save, chosen by the caster. If the save is successful, the target takes half the cold damage, takes no negative levels, and is not entangled. A sorcerer, witch, or wizard can boost the target word to make this spell affect multiple targets, but doing so increases the spell&rsquo;s overall level to 9th.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Selected Alignment Shield Enhance Form Grave Bane (cleric 6)</h2>\n<p>This wordspell grants the target a number of bonuses. First, it grants the target a +2 bonus to AC and on saving throws when it is attacked by creatures of one alignment type (chosen by the wordcaster). The wordspell also grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (chosen by the wordcaster).</p>\n<p>Finally, the wordspell grants an additional +4 sacred bonus on saving throws made against death spells and death magic effects; the subject cannot gain negative levels while this wordspell is in effect, and the target is automatically stabilized if brought below 0 hit points. All of these effects last for 1 round per level, as that is the duration of the effect word with the shortest duration. Note that alignment shield is only 1st level, and could be replaced with a 2nd-level effect word without changing the overall level of the spell.</p>"}

Descriptive Text}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 212</em></p>\n<p>A spell&rsquo;s components explain what you must do or possess to cast the spell. The components entry in a spell description includes abbreviations that tell you what type of components it requires. Specifics for material and focus components are given at the end of the descriptive text. Usually you don&rsquo;t need to worry about components, but when you can&rsquo;t use a component for some reason or when a material or focus component is expensive, then the components are important.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Verbal (V)</h2>\n<p>A verbal component is a spoken incantation. To provide a verbal component, you must be able to speak in a strong voice. A silence spell or a gag spoils the incantation (and thus the spell). A spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance of spoiling any spell with a verbal component that he tries to cast.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Somatic (S)</h2>\n<p>A somatic component is a measured and precise movement of the hand. You must have at least one hand free to provide a somatic component.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Material (M)</h2>\n<p>A material component consists of one or more physical substances or objects that are annihilated by the spell energies in the casting process. Unless a cost is given for a material component, the cost is negligible. Don&rsquo;t bother to keep track of material components with negligible cost. Assume you have all you need as long as you have your spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Focus (F)</h2>\n<p>A focus component is a prop of some sort. Unlike a material component, a focus is not consumed when the spell is cast and can be reused. As with material components, the cost for a focus is negligible unless a price is given. Assume that focus components of negligible cost are in your spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Divine Focus (DF)</h2>\n<p>A divine focus component is an item of spiritual signif icance. The divine focus for a cleric or a paladin is a holy symbol appropriate to the character&rsquo;s faith. The divine focus for a druid or a ranger is a sprig of holly, or some other sacred plant.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the Components line includes F/DF or M/DF, the arcane version of the spell has a focus component or a material component (the abbreviation before the slash) and the divine version has a divine focus component (the abbreviation after the slash).</p>"}

A reposition attempts to force a foe to move to a different position in relation to your location without doing any harm. If you do not have the Improved Reposition feat or a similar ability, attempting to reposition a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver. You cannot use this maneuver to move a foe into a space that is intrinsically dangerous, such as a pit or wall of fire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your attack is successful, you may move your target 5 feet to a new location.

Replacing Opposed Rolls}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source<em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Ultimate</em><em>&nbsp;Intrigue pg. 189</em></p>\n<p>Especially in intrigue-based games, there are situations in which many different creatures might normally need to roll an opposed skill check against a PC. For instance, if the rogue sneaks into a camp of 50 orcs, it would technically require rolling 50 Perception checks. This slows down the game, and it makes it almost certain that one of those orcs will roll a natural 20. This variant rule replaces opposed rolls to reduce this sheer number of rolls and the likelihood for a skilled PC to be defeated by math alone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With this variant, when a character attempts a skill check that would normally be opposed, he attempts the check as normal, comparing the result against the DC presented by each foe (DC = 11 + the foe&rsquo;s total skill bonus with the opposed skill). If the initiating character fails this check, he simply fails and immediately experiences the consequences of failure. If he succeeds, however, he does so only against the rank-and-file opponents (such as most of the warriors in an orc camp, or most of the hangers-on at a royal court). Select foes (such as major NPCs or dedicated scouts and guards) can attempt a check with the opposing skill (DC = 11 + the initiating character&rsquo;s total skill bonus with skill he originally used). This resembles the way the Disguise skill works, where only those who pay attention to the character and are suspicious of her can attempt a Perception check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, if a hunter is sneaking through a camp of 50 orcs and succeeds at her initial Stealth check against a DC of 11 + each orc&rsquo;s Perception modifier, she slips into the camp. Meanwhile, the two orcs posted as sentries scan for trouble, so each of those orcs (but not the other 48) rolls a Perception check to see if they notice the hunter. Similarly, a bard might succeed at a Bluff check to convince the minor nobles of the court of his exaggerated exploits, but three key aristocrats&mdash; suspicious of the bard to begin with&mdash;try to poke holes in the story and find contradictions by grilling the bard for details, each of them rolling Sense Motive checks against a DC of 11 + the bard&rsquo;s Bluff modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Bonuses:</strong>&nbsp;If the opposing group possesses a mix of bonuses, use the highest value to determine the DC. In the example of the orc camp, if 40 of the orc warriors have a &ndash;1 Perception modifier and 10 scouts have a +10 Perception modifier, the hunter would be attempting a DC 21 Stealth check. Note that because this variant doesn&rsquo;t specify which opponents beat the check, it is up to the GM to decide how the consequences of the failed check manifest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Odds</strong>: This variant increases the odds of success dramatically for highly skilled characters. For instance, if the hunter in the example above has a modifier on Stealth checks at least 9 higher than the orcs&rsquo; Perception modifiers, in the default system, she would have a 50% chance of succeeding. But with this variant, her chance increases to 85%. When the character has less of an advantage against her adversaries, this variant still increases the rate of success dramatically with many adversaries, and it decreases the rate slightly with a few determined adversaries.</p>\n<p>For instance, with the default system, if the hunter&rsquo;s Stealth matched the orcs&rsquo; Perception, she would have essentially a 0% chance of sneaking past the 50 orcs. With this variant, her chance is 1 in 8. However, if the other 48 orcs weren&rsquo;t present, her chance of sneaking past just the two sentries in the default system is roughly 1 in 4, whereas with this variant, it is 1 in 8, since only the determined adversaries make their own rolls and thus affect her odds.</p>"}

An unwary traveler might find himself entombed within this vast solidity of material and crushed into nothingness, with his powdered remains left as a warning to any foolish enough to follow. Despite its solid, unyielding nature, the Plane of Earth is varied in its consistency, ranging from soft soil to veins of heavier and more valuable metal.</p>\n<p>The Plane of Earth is a vast shell of stone and minerals shot through with tunnels and caverns that range from narrow squeezes to vast vaults capable of hosting entire worlds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The most fixed and stable of the Elemental Planes, the Plane of Earth is an effectively limitless domain of dirt, stone, and metals, its lightless depths crisscrossed by a network of interconnected tunnels and caverns. In primordial times, this plane was a single solid shell that barred all but the most acclimated or cunning species from entering. Since the Material Plane came into being, though, the essences of the other Elemental Planes&mdash;especially the adjacent shells of fire and water&mdash;have subtly influenced the Plane of Earth.</p>\n<p>The combination of planar convergences and the arrival of new inhabitants turned the Plane of Earth into the vast expanse of interlocking cave systems, bottomless crevasses, and bizarre, unique ecologies that it is today.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Along the immeasurable border between the Planes of Earth and Fire, stoic shaitan genies maintain bustling outposts geared toward trade, exploration, and general maintenance of the Peerless Empire&rsquo;s borders. These stations&rsquo; official orders from the empire&rsquo;s capital, the Opaline Vault, are to monitor for incursions of efreeti forces from the Plane of Fire, and most maintain at least a nominal defensive military force. In practice, the warring between the shaitans and the efreet is limited to a specific conflict between the Opaline Vault and the City of Brass, and in general, shaitans harbor no enmity for their fiery counterparts, and the two types of genies sometimes even work together when their interests align.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Denizens</h2>\n<p>The Plane of Earth is more populous than most natives and visitors alike realize, as entire societies can thrive within nooks and crannies that even the most experienced guides don&rsquo;t know exist.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Crystal Dragons</h3>\n<p>These draconic entities infused with elemental energy claim dominion over several small, personal empires in the Eternal Delve. The flighty nature of crystal dragons doesn&rsquo;t particularly predispose them to the rigors of ruling a nation, but their trade savvy&mdash;especially when it comes to precious gems and metals&mdash;combined with their altruistic natures often land them in such roles. Predispositions aside, once in a position of authority, these dragons fiercely protect those in their domains, providing comfortable living conditions free from the slavery that is ubiquitous in shaitan society.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Earth Elementals</h3>\n<p>Earth elementals are some of the oldest inhabitants of the Eternal Delve, and they are so attuned to their home plane that some spend entire decades or centuries fused with their surroundings, never revealing their existence until their whims move them to action. Other earth elementals traverse the plane&rsquo;s interior like swarms of insects, moving in dizzying and often unintelligible patterns. Many earth elementals&mdash;and mud elementals, to a lesser extent&mdash; are reclusive and territorial, clinging ferociously to their ever-changing homes. They have few, if any, reasons to communicate with other inhabitants of the plane, and most others view them as a natural hazard inherent to existence here. On occasion, though, a great threat to the plane has mustered the elementals&rsquo; strengths, and the shaitans of the Opaline Vault are constantly scheming to enlist them in their war against the efreet of the City of Brass.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Mephits</h3>\n<p>Mephits are considered pests by their domineering shaitan neighbors. The Peerless Empire subjugates earth and salt mephits without a second thought, but due to their sheer number, for every mephit captured another five go free. More often than not, when mephits are apprehended, the shaitans entrap them in extended contracts of servitude or use the empire&rsquo;s draconic laws to sentence them to extended work for the slightest violation. Ironically, many such mephits come to appreciate their newfound existence under shaitan rule, for it allows them to live among the trappings of power and opulence. The longest-serving of these mephits sometimes move on to become seneschals or minor power brokers within the rigid slave castes of the Peerless Empire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Oreads</h3>\n<p>With its abundance of open-air tunnels and caverns, the Eternal Delve has historically appealed to several races more commonly found on the Material Plane, including dwarves, humans, and even elves. However, the most populous of these races are oreads, whose ancestors hailed from the Plane of Earth. Although relatively common, they typically live in smaller, more isolated populations or scattered among great cities full of other creatures. Oreads mix easily with most of the native creatures here, but many never feel truly at home. Most leverage their resiliency and adaptability to serve as envoys between shaitans and xorns or even xiomorns. However, these roles are inherently risky, and more than a few oreads have found themselves on the wrong side of shaitans&rsquo; laws or accidentally delivering a fatal insult to a proud xiomorn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Shaitans</h3>\n<p>These large genies maintain the expansive Peerless Empire, a nation that spans the borders of the Plane of Earth and operates with ruthless efficiency. The earth genies are consummate contractors and use their talents to bind a wide array of creatures into serving them in everything from their business interests to maintaining their immaculate homes. They prefer willing servants over slaves, but those who oppose shaitans are ruthlessly forced into servitude, often spending their remaining existence toiling in the distant reaches of the Peerless Empire&rsquo;s mining operations. Shaitans have some manner of diplomatic relationship with nearly every race that exists on the Plane of Earth, even extending to some tentative deals with the efreet, although the shaitans of the Opaline Vault remain at war with the fire genies and refuse to participate in any dealings with them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Xiomorns</h3>\n<p>The xiomorns are a race of primordial builders and experimenters whose genius is tempered by a tendency to seize upon endeavors that they lose interest in relatively quickly. While xiomorns have spent recent centuries chiefly consumed with building enormous Vaults on the Material Plane, the center is full of immense, abandoned cavern-cities created by the xiomorns before they abandoned their incredible settlements on what appears to be little more than a whim. Their activities might seem capricious, but the xiomorns assert that all their actions are driven by exacting goals whose details they refuse to disclose. Xiomorns are divided into two distinct types: the Vault Builders and the Vault Keepers. The Vault Builders are mythic beings who rule over their lesser Vault Keeper counterparts. Most of the xiomorns who dwell on the Plane of Earth dedicate themselves either to crafting new vaults or venerating their elemental lord patron.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Xorns</h3>\n<p>Driven into solitude by hunger, xorns are commonly found in the wilderness regions of the Plane of Earth, far removed from territories controlled by other races. They live alone or in small communities known as clusters, distant from the open tunnels that break up the plane.</p>"}

Requiring the caster to touch a target with a hostile spell means the caster is in or very close to melee combat, and is risking retaliation from enemies and attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents. Similarly, while close-range spells give the caster a little more breathing room, a hostile target is generally within the range of a single move or a charge, allowing an opponent to close and attack the caster&mdash;even at caster level 14, a close-range spell only reaches 60 feet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In indoor situations, most medium-range combat spells may as well have an infinite range, because at the level the caster gains access to the spell, the caster can reach 150 feet or more, and few encounters deal with ranges that far&mdash;the caster can hit anything he can see. Even outdoors, a spell with a 150-foot range can hit anything in sight on a typical game mat like a Paizo GameMastery Flip-Mat (24 inches by 30 inches is 120 feet by 150 feet). Long range is likewise all-encompassing, with a 400-foot minimum range translating to almost 7 feet on a game mat&mdash;longer than many tables used for gaming. Long range only comes into play in abstract situations like launching a fireball at enemies across a large prairie, using dimension door to return to an earlier (and safer) part of the dungeon, and so on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Obviously, touch-range spells are the weakest type of spell, close-range spells are better but not extremely so, and medium- and long-range spells may as well be identical for most purposes. Given that the Enlarge Spell feat doubles a spell&rsquo;s range at a cost of +1 spell level, and the Reach Spell feat increases the range by one category (from touch to close, close to medium, medium to long), at a cost of +1 spell level, it&rsquo;s reasonable to balance a spell by assuming a +1 increase in level corresponds to increasing the range category by one. For example, a spell that works like cure light wounds (normally 1st level) at close range instead of touch is appropriate for a 2nd-level spell.</p>"}

Some plant companions have special abilities, such as scent.

Each plant companion gains an additional bonus, usually at 4th or 7th level, as listed with each companion choice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Plant companions are typically suitable only for specific archetypes, such as the treesinger druid archetype, but with the GM&rsquo;s permission, any druid could select a plant companion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trip: Because many plant companions have several rootlike legs, they are very difficult to trip.

Walls and Gates} section), unless the character can reach a roof by jumping down from a higher window, balcony, or bridge. Flat roofs, common only in warm climates (as accumulated snow can cause a flat roof to collapse), are easy to run across. Moving along the peak of a pitched roof requires a DC 20 Acrobatics check. Moving on an angled roof surface without changing altitude (moving parallel to the peak, in other words) requires a DC 15 Acrobatics check. Moving up and down across the peak of a roof requires a DC 10 Acrobatics check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eventually a character runs out of roof, requiring a long jump across to the next roof or down to the ground. The distance to the closest roof is usually 1d3 &times; 5 feet horizontally, but the next roof is equally likely to be 5 feet higher, 5 feet lower, or the same height. Use the guidelines in the Acrobatics skill (a horizontal jump&rsquo;s peak height is one-fourth of the horizontal distance) to determine whether a character can make a jump.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sewers</h2>\n<p>To get into the sewers, most characters open a grate (a full-round action) and jump down 10 feet. Sewers are built exactly like dungeons, except that they&rsquo;re much more likely to have floors that are slippery or covered with water. Sewers are also similar to dungeons in terms of creatures liable to be encountered therein. Some cities were built atop the ruins of older civilizations, so their sewers sometimes lead to treasures and dangers from a bygone age.</p>"}

Binders should be aware, however, that brijidine have exotic, expensive, and particular tastes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ghaele (SR 25)</h2>\n<p>Ghaeles are strong hunters, courtly and knightly, and pursue great foes. Offering them evidence of the binder&rsquo;s mighty hunts (at least 3 CR higher than the binder), or summoning them to a locale where they can pursue dragons or fiends provides a Charisma bonus to the caster.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lillend</h2>\n<p>The most artistic of the azatas, lillends love stories, histories, tales, poems, and songs. Offerings to summoned lillends include original songs, performances, or other art forms; they also adore magical instruments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lyrakien</h2>\n<p>Musicians among the azata, lyrakien can be persuaded to service with gifts of wondrous musical instruments and rare bits of music&mdash;especially fey music.</p>"}

Changing Alignment}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 166</em></p>\n<p>A creature&rsquo;s general moral and personal attitudes are represented by its alignment: lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil.</p>\n<p>Alignment is a tool for developing your character&rsquo;s identity&mdash;it is not a straitjacket for restricting your character. Each alignment represents a broad range of personality types or personal philosophies, so two characters of the same alignment can still be quite different from each other. In addition, few people are completely consistent.</p>\n<p>All creatures have an alignment. Alignment determines the effectiveness of some spells and magic items.</p>\n<p>Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are neutral. Even deadly vipers and tigers that eat people are neutral because they lack the capacity for morally right or wrong behavior. Dogs may be obedient and cats free-spirited, but they do not have the moral capacity to be truly lawful or chaotic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Good Versus Evil</h2>\n<p>Good characters and creatures protect innocent life. Evil characters and creatures debase or destroy innocent life, whether for fun or profit.</p>\n<p><strong>Good</strong> implies altruism, respect for life, and a concern for the dignity of sentient beings. Good characters make personal sacrifices to help others.</p>\n<p><strong>Evil</strong> implies hurting, oppressing, and killing others. Some evil creatures simply have no compassion for others and kill without qualms if doing so is convenient. Others actively pursue evil, killing for sport or out of duty to some evil deity or master.</p>\n<p>People who are <strong>neutral</strong> with respect to good and evil have compunctions against killing the innocent, but may lack the commitment to make sacrifices to protect or help others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Law Versus Chaos</h2>\n<p>Lawful characters tell the truth, keep their word, respect authority, honor tradition, and judge those who fall short of their duties. Chaotic characters follow their consciences, resent being told what to do, favor new ideas over tradition, and do what they promise if they feel like it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Law</strong> implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to authority, and reliability. On the downside, lawfulness can include closed-mindedness, reactionary adherence to tradition, self-righteousness, and a lack of adaptability. Those who consciously promote lawfulness say that only lawful behavior creates a society in which people can depend on each other and make the right decisions in full confidence that others will act as they should.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Chaos</strong> implies freedom, adaptability, and flexibility. On the downside, chaos can include recklessness, resentment toward legitimate authority, arbitrary actions, and irresponsibility. Those who promote chaotic behavior say that only unfettered personal freedom allows people to express themselves fully and lets society benef it from the potential that its individuals have within them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Someone who is <strong>neutral</strong> with respect to law and chaos has some respect for authority and feels neither a compulsion to obey nor a compulsion to rebel. She is generally honest, but can be tempted into lying or deceiving others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alignment Steps</h2>\n<p>Occasionally the rules refer to &ldquo;steps&rdquo; when dealing with alignment. In this case, &ldquo;steps&rdquo; refers to the number of alignment shifts between the two alignments, as shown on the following diagram. Note that diagonal &ldquo;steps&rdquo; count as two steps. For example, a lawful neutral character is one step away from a lawful good alignment, and three steps away from a chaotic evil alignment. A cleric&rsquo;s alignment must be within one step of the alignment of her deity.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[TrN8uuKTVhHM8YWX]{1.5.1.

Designing Spells}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 137</em></p>\n<p>While spell descriptors are frequently overlooked, they play an important role in the mechanics of a spell. Assigning the correct descriptors is key to finishing the spell. The follows is a list of all the descriptors in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, including several new ones introduced in this book.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Acid</h2>\n<p>Acid effects deal damage with chemical reactions rather than cold, electricity, heat, or vibration. This descriptor includes both actual acids and their chemical opposites, called bases or alkalines (such as ammonia and lye).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Air</h2>\n<p>Spells that create air, manipulate air, or conjure creatures from air-dominant planes or with the air subtype should have the air descriptor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Chaotic</h2>\n<p>Spells that draw upon the power of true chaos or conjure creatures from chaos-aligned planes or with the chaotic subtype should have the chaos descriptor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cold</h2>\n<p>Cold effects deal damage by making the target colder, typically by blasting it with supernaturally cooled matter or energy. Cold effects also include those that create ice, sleet, or snow out of nothing. They can cause frostbite, numbness, coordination problems, slowed movement and reactions, stupor, and death.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Curse</h2>\n<p>Curses are often permanent effects, and usually cannot be dispelled, but can be removed with a break enchantment, limited wish, miracle, remove curse, or wish.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Darkness</h2>\n<p>Spells that create darkness or reduce the amount of light should have the darkness descriptor. Giving a spell the darkness descriptor indicates whether a spell like daylight is high enough level to counter or dispel it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Death</h2>\n<p>Spells with the death descriptor directly attack a creature&rsquo;s life force to cause immediate death, or to draw on the power of a dead or dying creature. The death ward spell protects against death effects, and some creature types are immune to death effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Disease</h2>\n<p>Disease effects give the target a disease, which may be an invading organism such as a bacteria or virus, an abnormal internal condition (such as a cancer or mental disorder), or a recurring magical effect that acts like one of the former. Creatures with resistance or immunity to disease apply that resistance to their saving throw and the effects of disease spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Earth</h2>\n<p>Spells that manipulate earth or conjure creatures from earth-dominant planes or with the earth subtype should have the earth descriptor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Electricity</h2>\n<p>Electricity effects involve the presence and flow of electrical charge, whether expressed in amperes or volts. Electricity deals damage to creatures by disrupting their biological systems. It deals damage to objects (as well as creatures) by heating the material it passes through, and thus technically many electricity spells could also be treated as fire spells, but for sake of game simplicity, it is better to just let electricity-based spells deal electricity damage. Electricity effects may stun, paralyze, or even kill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Emotion</h2>\n<p>Spells with this descriptor create emotions or manipulate the target&rsquo;s existing emotions. Most emotion spells are enchantments, except for fear spells, which are usually necromancy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Evil</h2>\n<p>Spells that draw upon evil powers or conjure creatures from evil-aligned planes or with the evil subtype should have the evil descriptor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fear</h2>\n<p>Spells with the fear descriptor create, enhance, or manipulate fear. Most fear spells are necromancy spells, though some are enchantment spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fire</h2>\n<p>Fire effects make the target hotter by creating fire, directly heating the target with magic or friction. Lava, steam, and boiling water all deal fire damage. Fire effects can also cause confusion, dizziness, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea, unconsciousness, and death. Spells that manipulate fire or conjure creatures from fire-dominant planes or with the fire subtype should have the fire descriptor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Force</h2>\n<p>Spells with the force descriptor create or manipulate magical force. Force spells affect incorporeal creatures normally (as if they were corporeal creatures).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Good</h2>\n<p>Spells that draw upon the power of true goodness or conjure creatures from good-aligned planes or with the good subtype should have the good descriptor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Language-Dependent</h2>\n<p>A language-dependent spell uses intelligible language as a medium for communication. If the target cannot understand or hear what the caster of a language-dependent spell says, the spell has no effect, even if the target fails its saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lawful</h2>\n<p>Spells that draw upon the power of true law or conjure creatures from law-aligned planes or with the lawful subtype should have the law descriptor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Light</h2>\n<p>Spells that create significant amounts of light or attack darkness effects should have the light descriptor. Giving a spell the light descriptor indicates whether a spell like darkness is high enough level counter or dispel it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mind-Affecting</h2>\n<p>Mindless creatures (those with an Intelligence score of &ldquo;&mdash;&rdquo;) and undead are immune to mind-affecting effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pain</h2>\n<p>Pain effects cause unpleasant sensations without any permanent physical damage (though a sensitive target may suffer mental repercussions from lengthy exposure to pain). Creatures that are immune to effects that require a Fort save (such as constructs and undead) are immune to pain effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Poison</h2>\n<p>Poison effects use poison, venom, drugs, or similar toxic substances to disrupt and damage living creatures through chemical reactions. Technically, acids and poisons are both chemical reactions, but for the purpose of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, they are categorized as different effects, with acids dealing hit point damage and poisons causing ability damage, ability drain, bleeding, confusion, convulsions, nausea, paralysis, reduced healing, suffocation, unconsciousness, or death. Creatures with resistance to poison (such as dwarves) apply that resistance to their saving throws and the effects of poison spells. Creatures with immunity are immune to poisonous aspects of poison spells, but not necessarily all effects of the spell (for example, a spell that creates a pit full of liquid poison could still trap or drown a poison-immune creature).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shadow</h2>\n<p>Shadow spells manipulate matter or energy from the Shadow Plane, or allow transport to or from that plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sonic</h2>\n<p>Sonic effects transmit energy to the target through frequent oscillations of pressure through the air, water, or ground. Sounds that are too high or too low for the humanoid ear to detect can still transmit enough energy to cause harm, which means that these effects can even affect deafened creatures. Sound effects can cause hit point damage, deafness, dizziness, nausea, pain, shortness of breath, and temporary blindness, and can detect creatures using batlike echolocation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Water</h2>\n<p>Spells that manipulate water or conjure creatures from water-dominant planes or with the water subtype should have the water descriptor.</p>"}

Other catastrophic events such as massive rainstorms or the destruction of a dam can create floods as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During a flood, rivers become wider, deeper, and swifter. Assume that a river rises by 1d10+10 feet during the spring flood, and its width increases by a factor of 1d4 &times; 50%. Fords might disappear for days, bridges might be swept away, and even ferries might not be able to manage the crossing of a flooded river. A river in flood makes Swim checks one category harder (calm water becomes rough, and rough water becomes stormy). Rivers also become 50% swifter.</p>"}

Driving Devices}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 174</em></p>\n<p>The rules for turning a vehicle are a simple way of getting vehicles to turn on a grid, but when a vehicle turns, it doesn&rsquo;t do so sharply, even when powered by magic; vehicles rarely make turns evenly. If this simple system involves too much abstraction, you can have vehicles make wide turns.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Have the driver make a driving check as usual. If she succeeds at the check, she can turn the vehicle. When a vehicle makes a turn, it has a chance to make a vehicular overrun or ramming maneuver on any creature within the turning area, which is a square with sides equal to the vehicle&rsquo;s length, with one vertex touching the front facing of the vehicle on the side opposite to the direction of the turn. In other words, put the square with one side running along the vehicle&rsquo;s front, perpendicular to its forward facing, and another running the direction of its current forward facing. Place the square so its far corner is within the desired destination of the vehicle. If the turn is successful, the vehicle ends this movement in that area, facing toward the direction of the turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The vehicle then makes either vehicular overruns or vehicular bull rushes (if the driver makes the required swift action) on all creatures and objects within the square that are smaller than it, and makes ramming maneuvers on all creatures and objects that are larger than it, including solid objects. It takes a &ndash;10 penalty on the vehicular bull rush and vehicular overrun maneuvers. The driver can choose to make these in any order she likes. She makes them one at a time (even after the vehicle is wrecked or comes to a sudden stop), and all effects are cumulative. If the vehicle is wrecked or comes to a sudden stop, the GM decides the final resting location within the turning area, picking the most plausible location given the effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For instance, if the square has two objects larger than the vehicle and three creatures smaller than it, and the driver decides to make the ramming maneuver on the objects first, and then is wrecked during the ramming maneuver on the second object, the vehicle still makes the vehicular overruns on the other two creatures. It ends in a location of the GM&rsquo;s choosing.</p>"}

A dueling counter is similar to a counterspell, but is easier to use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When a dueling opponent tries to cast a spell, the targeted spellcaster can make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell&rsquo;s level) as a free action. If the check succeeds, she can identify her opponent&rsquo;s spell and can attempt a dueling counter. If it fails, she cannot attempt a dueling counter against that spell (although special actions are still available to her).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A dueling counter is an immediate action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. To attempt a dueling counter, the countering duelist must expend a spell or spell slot of a level equal to or higher than that of the spell being cast. Note that characters who cast spells spontaneously (such as bards, oracles, and sorcerers) must choose which exact spell they are using to counterspell in addition to the slot being used. The countering duelist must then make a caster level check against a DC of 15 + the spell&rsquo;s caster level. Unlike when using a true counterspell action (which requires a readied action), even expending an exact copy of the spell being cast does not guarantee success.</p>\n<p>The caster attempting the counterspell receives a bonus or penalty on her check depending upon the level of the spell slot being expended and the exact spell used, as noted in Table 3&ndash;10. If the check is successful, the spell is countered&mdash;it is negated and the spell is lost. If not, the spell takes effect as normal and the duelist attempting to counter the spell takes a &ndash;2 penalty on any saving throws made against the spell&rsquo;s effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a spellcaster can use dispel magic or greater dispel magic as a dueling counter. When a duelist spellcaster does so, he does not need to identify the spell being cast, can counter a spell of any level, and must succeed at a caster level check against a DC of 11 + the spell&rsquo;s caster level. When dispel magic is used as a dueling counter, it is not modified by any of the circumstances in Table 3&ndash;10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because readying a counterspell is its own action, a dueling spellcaster can prepare to counterspell and make a dueling counter in the same round. This is only useful if the participant is facing multiple opponents, or someone with access to the Quicken Spell feat or other abilities that allow casting two spells in the same round.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 72.3379%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 68.9165%;\">Circumstance</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.7949%;\">Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 68.9165%;\">Spell is of a different school</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.7949%;\">-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 68.9165%;\">Spell is of the same school, but not the same spell</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.7949%;\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 68.9165%;\">Spell is of a higher level than the spell being countered</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.7949%;\">+1/level above</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 68.9165%;\">Spell is the same as the spell being countered</td>\n<td style=\"width: 30.7949%;\">+10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

It also opposes Bluff to determine whether someone is lying, making it an important social defensive skill in an intrigue-based game.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Active and Automatic Sense Motive</strong>: Most uses of Sense Motive are active and require a character to spend a minute or more interacting with someone with the intent of using Sense Motive for a particular purpose. The only time that Sense Motive happens automatically is when it opposes Bluff, as it says in the Core Rulebook that a character attempts a Sense Motive check for every Bluff check attempted against him. See the Bluff section on page 182 for guidance on how often to call for Bluff checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Noticing Enchantments</strong>: Sense Motive allows a character to notice someone whose behavior is being influenced by an enchantment, though as an active check, this takes at least 1 minute of interaction and the intention to sense enchantments. This doesn&rsquo;t notice enchantments that aren&rsquo;t actually causing a difference in behavior at the time. For instance, if a creature is under charm person but the caster isn&rsquo;t around and doesn&rsquo;t come up in conversation, a Sense Motive check won&rsquo;t reveal the enchantment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Hunches</strong>: The use of Sense Motive to &ldquo;get a hunch&rdquo; mentions getting a feeling that someone is trustworthy or is an impostor, and it lists a static DC. This doesn&rsquo;t mean to say that anyone who can succeed at a DC 20 Sense Motive check can automatically find an impostor with high Bluff and Disguise modifiers. The DC 20 check assumes that the other character is not opposing the Sense Motive check with Bluff. This is particularly useful in situations with a group of impostors, one of whom is silver-tongued and does all the talking while the others aren&rsquo;t saying anything but aren&rsquo;t skilled at Bluff.</p>\n<p>For instance, a hunch might help against a group of quiet assassins dressed as servants and trickling into the grand hall. The information gained from a hunch is general, not specific, and usually results in an ambiguous inkling. You can get a vague feeling that something is wrong or that someone seems trustworthy, but no more specific information than that. In the example above, a character who received a hunch wouldn&rsquo;t know that the servants are specifically assassins, but would get a sense that something was off about the servants.</p>"}

Cliffs taller than 80 feet take up 20 feet of horizontal space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Chasm</h2>\n<p>Usually formed by natural geological processes, chasms function like pits in a dungeon setting. Chasms aren&rsquo;t hidden, so characters won&rsquo;t fall into them by accident (although bull rushes are another story). A typical chasm is 2d4 &times; 10 feet deep, at least 20 feet long, and anywhere from 5 feet to 20 feet wide. It takes a DC 15 Climb check to climb out of a chasm. In forbidding mountain terrain, chasms are typically 2d8 &times; 10 feet deep.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Light Undergrowth</h2>\n<p>This functions as described in Forest Terrain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Scree</h2>\n<p>A field of shifting gravel, scree doesn&rsquo;t affect speed, but it can be treacherous on a slope. The DC of Acrobatics checks increases by 2 if there&rsquo;s scree on a gradual slope and by 5 if there&rsquo;s scree on a steep slope. The DC of Stealth checks increases by 2 if the scree is on a slope of any kind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dense Rubble</h2>\n<p>The ground is covered with rocks of all sizes. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square with dense rubble. The DC of Acrobatics checks on dense rubble increases by 5, and the DC of Stealth checks increases by 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Rock Wall</h2>\n<p>A vertical plane of stone, rock walls require DC 25 Climb checks to ascend. A typical rock wall is 2d4 &times; 10 feet tall in rugged mountains and 2d8 &times; 10 feet tall in forbidding mountains. Rock walls are drawn on the edges of squares, not in the squares themselves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cave Entrance</h2>\n<p>Found in cliff and steep slope squares and next to rock walls, cave entrances are typically between 5 and 20 feet wide and 5 feet deep. A cave could be anything from a simple chamber to the entrance to an elaborate dungeon. Caves used as monster lairs typically have 1d3 rooms that are 1d4 &times; 10 feet across.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Other Mountain Terrain Features</h2>\n<p>Most alpine meadows begin above the treeline, so trees and other forest elements are rare in the mountains. Mountain terrain can include active streams (5 to 10 feet wide and no more than 5 feet deep) and dry streambeds (treat as a trench 5 to 10 feet across). Particularly high-altitude areas tend to be colder than the lowland areas that surround them, so they might be covered in ice sheets (described in @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.3YyU7Yg6wbShgOKM]{3.2.6. Desert Terrain}).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stealth and Detection in Mountains</h2>\n<p>As a guideline, the maximum distance in mountain terrain at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 4d10 &times; 10 feet. Certain peaks and ridgelines afford much better vantage points, of course, and twisting valleys and canyons have much shorter spotting distances. Because there&rsquo;s little vegetation to obstruct line of sight, the specifics on your map are your best guide for the range at which an encounter could begin. As in hills terrain, a ridge or peak provides enough cover to hide from anyone below the high point.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s easier to hear faraway sounds in the mountains. The DC of Perception checks that rely on sound increase by 1 per 20 feet between listener and source, not per 10 feet.</p>"}

How to Play","flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_ykq89awr3w"}},"content":"<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.8scSEgBEtJZj0suf]{(Index) Basic Rules}</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>How to Play</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 8</em></p>\n<p>The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game is a tabletop fantasy game in which the players take on the roles of heroes who form a group (or party) to set out on dangerous adventures. Helping them tell this story is the Game Master (or GM), who decides what threats the player characters (or PCs) face and what sorts of rewards they earn for succeeding at their quest. Think of it as a cooperative storytelling game, where the players play the protagonists and the Game Master acts as the narrator, controlling the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>If you are a player, you make all of the decisions for your character, from what abilities your character has to the type of weapon he carries. Playing a character, however, is more than just following the rules in this book. You also decide your character&rsquo;s personality. Is he a noble knight, set on vanquishing a powerful evil, or is he a conniving rogue who cares more about gold than glory? The choice is up to you.</p>\n<p>If you are a Game Master, you control the world that the players explore. Your job is to bring the setting to life and to present the characters with challenges that are both fair and exciting. From the local merchant prince to the rampaging dragon, you control all of the characters that are not being played by the players. Paizo&rsquo;s Pathfinder Adventure Path series, Pathfinder Modules, and Pathfinder Chronicles world guides provide everything you need to run a game, or you can invent your own, using the rules in this book as well as the monsters found in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>What You Need</strong></h2>\n<p>In addition to this book, you will need a number of special dice to play the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. The dice that come with most board games have six sides, but the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game uses dice with four sides, six sides, eight sides, ten sides, twelve sides, and twenty sides. Dice of this sort can be found at your local game store or online at paizo.com.</p>\n<p>In addition to dice, if you are a player, you will need a character sheet (which can be photocopied from the back of this book) and, if the Game Master uses a map to represent the adventure, a small figurine to represent your character. These figurines, or miniatures, can also be found at most game stores. They come in a wide variety of styles, so you can probably find a miniature that relatively accurately depicts your character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are the Game Master, you will need a copy of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary, which contains the rules for a whole spectrum of monsters, from the mighty dragon to the lowly goblin. While many of these monsters can be used to fight against the players, others might provide useful information or become powerful allies. Some might even join the group, with one of the players taking on the role of a monstrous character. In addition, you should have your own set of dice and some sort of screen you can use to hide your notes, maps, and dice rolls behind. (Although you should be honest about the results of your dice rolls, sometimes the results are not evident, and openly rolling the dice might give away too much information.) Combat in the Pathfinder RPG can be resolved in one of two ways: you can describe the situation to the characters and allow them to interact based on the description you provide, or you can draw the situation on a piece of paper or a specially made battle mat and allow the characters to move their miniatures around to more accurately represent their position during the battle. While both ways have their advantages, if you choose the latter, you will need a mat to draw on, such as Paizo&rsquo;s line of GameMastery Flip-Mats, as well as miniatures to represent the monsters or other adversaries. These can also be found at your local game shop, or at paizo.com.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Playing the Game</strong></h2>\n<p>While playing the Pathfinder RPG, the Game Master describes the events that occur in the game world, and the players take turns describing what their characters do in response to those events. Unlike storytelling, however, the actions of the players and the characters controlled by the Game Master (frequently called non-player characters, or NPCs) are not certain. Most actions require dice rolls to determine success, with some tasks being more difficult than others. Each character is better at some things than he is at other things, granting him bonuses based on his skills and abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whenever a roll is required, the roll is noted as &ldquo;d#,&rdquo; with the &ldquo;#&rdquo; representing the number of sides on the die. If you need to roll multiple dice of the same type, there will be a number before the &ldquo;d.&rdquo; For example, if you are required to roll 4d6, you should roll four six-sided dice and add the results together. Sometimes there will be a + or &ndash; after the notation, meaning that you add that number to, or subtract it from, the total results of the dice (not to each individual die rolled). Most die rolls in the game use a d20 with a number of modifiers based on the character&rsquo;s skills, his or her abilities, and the situation. Generally speaking, rolling high is better than rolling low. Percentile rolls are a special case, indicated as rolling d%. You can generate a random number in this range by rolling two differently colored ten-sided dice (2d10). Pick one color to represent the tens digit, then roll both dice. If the die chosen to be the tens digit rolls a &ldquo;4&rdquo; and the other d10 rolls a &ldquo;2,&rdquo; then you&rsquo;ve generated a 42. A zero on the tens digit die indicates a result from 1 to 9, or 100 if both dice result in a zero. Some d10s are printed with &ldquo;10,&rdquo; &ldquo;20,&rdquo; &ldquo;30,&rdquo; and so on in order to make reading d% rolls easier. Unless otherwise noted, whenever you must round a number, always round down.</p>\n<p>As your character goes on adventures, he earns gold, magic items, and experience points. Gold can be used to purchase better equipment, while magic items possess powerful abilities that enhance your character. Experience points are awarded for overcoming challenges and completing major storylines. When your character has earned enough experience points, he increases his character level by one, granting him new powers and abilities that allow him to take on even greater challenges. While a 1st-level character might be up to saving a farmer&rsquo;s daughter from rampaging goblins, defeating a terrifying red dragon might require the powers of a 20th-level hero. It is the Game Master&rsquo;s duty to provide challenges for your character that are engaging, but not so deadly as to leave you with no hope of success. For more information on the duties of being a Game Master, see Chapter 12.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Above all, have fun. Playing the Pathfinder RPG is supposed to be exciting and rewarding for both the Game Master and the players. Adventure awaits!</p>\n<h1>The Most Important Rule</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 9</em></p>\n<p>The rules in this book are here to help you breathe life into your characters and the world they explore. While they are designed to make your game easy and exciting, you might find that some of them do not suit the style of play that your gaming group enjoys. Remember that these rules are yours. You can change them to fit your needs. Most Game Masters have a number of &ldquo;house rules&rdquo; that they use in their games. The Game Master and players should always discuss any rules changes to make sure that everyone understands how the game will be played. Although the Game Master is the final arbiter of the rules, the Pathfinder RPG is a shared experience, and all of the players should contribute their thoughts when the rules are in doubt.</p>"}

Siege Engines}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 158</em></p>\n<p>A classic trope of fantasy warfare is the storming of a castle or other large fortification. Whether the PCs are leading a brave and desperate defense of a lonely bastion against an overwhelming army of darkness, or overseeing the fight to overthrow an evil ruler and cast down his mighty fortress, a fight along the battlements can fire the imagination of a jaded player who has grown bored with one-on-one hacking.</p>\n<p>While historical sieges often depended more on disease and starvation for victory than anything else, the thrill for players is likely to come more from bombardment and assault with an array of siege engines, and countering the massive engines of their enemies with their own.</p>\n<h1>New Rules</h1>\n<p>The following new options for siege engines both supplement and expand upon the base rules. If the rules ever appear to be in conflict, use the rules below.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.1r4vHoZMGtSTTqJL]{2.11.4.1. Siege Engine Rules}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.fRkRfI16CX5G78Oy]{2.11.4.2. Siege Weapon Description}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.IMe9LQrT7kkBr8ew]{2.11.4.3.

Siege Engine Details}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Basic Rules</h1>\n<p>The basic rules for siege engines from the Core Rulebook are found below.</p>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 434</em></p>\n<p>Siege engines are large weapons, temporary structures, or pieces of equipment traditionally used in besieging castles or fortresses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Siege engines are treated as difficult devices if someone tries to disable them using Disable Device. This takes 2d4 rounds and requires a DC 20 Disable Device check. Siege engines are typically made out of wood and have an AC of 3 (&ndash;5 Dex, &ndash;2 size), a Hardness of 5, and 80 hit points. Siege engines made up of a different material might have different values. Some siege engines are armored as well. Treat the siege engine as a Huge creature to determine the cost of such armor. Siege engines can be crafted as masterwork and enchanted as magic weapons, adding bonuses on attack rolls to the checks made to hit with the siege engine. A masterwork siege engine costs 300 gp more than the listed price. Enchanting a siege engine costs twice the normal amount. For example, a +1 flaming heavy catapult, armored with full plate, would have an AC of 11 and would cost 23,100 gp (800 gp base + 6,000 gp for the armor + 300 gp masterwork + 16,000 gp for the enhancements).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Catapult, Heavy</h2>\n<p>A heavy catapult is a massive engine capable of throwing rocks or heavy objects with great force. Because the catapult throws its payload in a high arc, it can hit squares out of its line of sight. To fire a heavy catapult, the crew chief makes a special check against DC 15 using only his base attack bonus, Intelligence modifier, range increment penalty, and the appropriate modifiers from the lower section of Table 13&ndash;8. If the check succeeds, the catapult stone hits the square the catapult was aimed at, dealing the indicated damage to any object or character in the square. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save take half damage. Once a catapult stone hits a square, subsequent shots hit the same square unless the catapult is reaimed or the wind changes direction or speed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a catapult stone misses, roll 1d8 to determine where it lands. This determines the misdirection of the throw, with 1 being back toward the catapult and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the target square. Finally, count 1d4 squares away from the target square for every range increment of the attack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Loading a catapult requires a series of full-round actions. It takes a DC 15 Strength check to winch the throwing arm down; most catapults have wheels to allow up to two crew members to use the aid another action, assisting the main winch operator. A DC 15 Profession (siege engineer) check latches the arm into place, and then another DC 15 Profession (siege engineer) check loads the catapult ammunition. It takes four fullround actions to reaim a heavy catapult (multiple crew members can perform these full-round actions in the same round, so it would take a crew of four only 1 round to reaim the catapult).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A heavy catapult takes up a space 15 feet across.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Catapult, Light</h2>\n<p>This is a smaller, lighter version of the heavy catapult. It functions as the heavy catapult, except that it takes a DC 10 Strength check to winch the arm into place, and only two full-round actions are required to reaim the catapult.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A light catapult takes up a space 10 feet across.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ballista</h2>\n<p>A ballista is essentially a Huge heavy crossbow fixed in place. Its size makes it hard for most creatures to aim it. Thus, a Medium creature takes a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls when using a ballista, and a Small creature takes a &ndash;6 penalty. It takes a creature smaller than Large two full-round actions to reload the ballista after firing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A ballista takes up a space 5 feet across.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ram</h2>\n<p>This heavy pole is sometimes suspended from a movable scaffold that allows the crew to swing it back and forth against objects. As a full-round action, the character closest to the front of the ram makes an attack roll against the AC of the construction, applying the &ndash;4 penalty for lack of proficiency. It&rsquo;s not possible to be proficient with this device. In addition to the damage given on Table 13&ndash;8, up to nine other characters holding the ram can add their Strength modifiers to the ram&rsquo;s damage, if they devote an attack action to doing so. It takes at least one Huge or larger creature, two Large creatures, four Medium creatures, or eight Small creatures to swing a ram.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A ram is typically 30 feet long. In a battle, the creatures wielding the ram stand in two adjacent columns of equal length, with the ram between them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Siege Tower</h2>\n<p>This device is a massive wooden tower on wheels or rollers that can be rolled up against a wall to allow attackers to scale the tower and thus get to the top of the wall with cover. The wooden walls are usually 1 foot thick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A typical siege tower takes up a space 15 feet across. The creatures inside push it at a base land speed of 10 feet (and a siege tower can&rsquo;t run). The eight creatures pushing on the ground floor have total cover, and those on higher floors get improved cover and can fire through arrow slits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 13-8: Seige Engines</h2>\n<p>200 ft.

The defender&rsquo;s spell resistance is like an Armor Class against magical attacks. If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn&rsquo;t affect the creature. The possessor does not have to do anything special to use spell resistance. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for its spell resistance to operate.</p>\n<p>Only spells and spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance. Extraordinary and supernatural abilities (including enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are not. A creature can have some abilities that are subject to spell resistance and some that are not.

Arcane Spells and Armor}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 218</em></p>\n<p>A wizard&rsquo;s level limits the number of spells he can prepare and cast. His high Intelligence score might allow him to prepare a few extra spells. He can prepare the same spell more than once, but each preparation counts as one spell toward his daily limit. To prepare a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Rest</h2>\n<p>To prepare his daily spells, a wizard must first sleep for 8 hours. The wizard does not have to slumber for every minute of the time, but he must refrain from movement, combat, spellcasting, skill use, conversation, or any other fairly demanding physical or mental task during the rest period. If his rest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total amount of time he has to rest in order to clear his mind, and he must have at least 1 hour of uninterrupted rest immediately prior to preparing his spells. If the character does not need to sleep for some reason, he still must have 8 hours of restful calm before preparing any spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Recent Casting Limit/Rest Interruptions</h2>\n<p>If a wizard has cast spells recently, the drain on his resources reduces his capacity to prepare new spells. When he prepares spells for the coming day, all the spells he has cast within the last 8 hours count against his daily limit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Preparation Environment</h2>\n<p>To prepare any spell, a wizard must have enough peace, quiet, and comfort to allow for proper concentration. The wizard&rsquo;s surroundings need not be luxurious, but they must be free from distractions. Exposure to inclement weather prevents the necessary concentration, as does any injury or failed saving throw the character might experience while studying. Wizards also must have access to their spellbooks to study from and sufficient light to read them. There is one major exception: a wizard can prepare a read magic spell even without a spellbook.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Preparation Time</h2>\n<p>After resting, a wizard must study his spellbook to prepare any spells that day. If he wants to prepare all his spells, the process takes 1 hour. Preparing some smaller portion of his daily capacity takes a proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes, the minimum time required to achieve the proper mental state.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Selection and Preparation</h2>\n<p>Until he prepares spells from his spellbook, the only spells a wizard has available to cast are the ones that he already had prepared from the previous day and has not yet used. During the study period, he chooses which spells to prepare. If a wizard already has spells prepared (from the previous day) that he has not cast, she can abandon some or all of them to make room for new spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When preparing spells for the day, a wizard can leave some of these spell slots open. Later during that day, he can repeat the preparation process as often as he likes, time and circumstances permitting. During these extra sessions of preparation, the wizard can fill these unused spell slots. He cannot, however, abandon a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a slot that is empty because he has cast a spell in the meantime. That sort of preparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the first session of the day, this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if the wizard prepares more than one-quarter of his spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Prepared Spell Retention</h2>\n<p>Once a wizard prepares a spell, it remains in his mind as a nearly cast spell until he uses the prescribed components to complete and trigger it or until he abandons it. Certain other events, such as the effects of magic items or special attacks from monsters, can wipe a prepared spell from a character&rsquo;s mind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Death and Prepared Spell Retention</h2>\n<p>If a spellcaster dies, all prepared spells stored in his mind are wiped away. Potent magic (such as raise dead, resurrection, or true resurrection) can recover the lost energy when it recovers the character.</p>"}

Affecting the Crowd's Attitude}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 153</em></p>\n<p>While combatants do the actual fighting in performance combat, the crowd remains an active participant in these bouts. The audience can bolster or demoralize the competitors with their enthusiasm or scorn for what they see on the battlefield, with serious results.</p>\n<p>A crowd&rsquo;s attitude is similar to a nonplayer character&rsquo;s attitude when a character uses the Diplomacy skill. The DC of performance combat checks to improve crowd reaction is tied to the crowd&rsquo;s starting or current attitude. Each time the combatants do something spectacular on the battlefield, they have the opportunity to parlay that success into a better crowd reaction, but missteps can also create contempt among the crowd.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During performance combat, it is important for the GM to keep track of the crowd&rsquo;s attitude toward each side of the combat. Given that a crowd is filled with many people shouting, clapping, booing, hissing, or otherwise showing their pleasure or displeasure, the exact crowd reaction changes from moment to moment based on events on the battlefield, but groups of combatants always have a reasonable idea of what the crowd thinks of their performance at any given time.</p>\n<p>The following are the general categories of crowd reaction and attitude. They are listed from lowest regard to highest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hostile</h2>\n<p>The crowd does not like what it is seeing. Hostile crowds demoralize combatants in a performance combat. In these battles, while the crowd is hostile toward a given side, those combatants take a &ndash;2 penalty on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p>If the crowd is hostile toward a side of the combat and a member of that side fails a performance combat check by 5 or more, that side automatically loses the performance part of the combat. This can be important for the story of the game, or if the PCs are participating in serialized performance combats.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Unfriendly</h2>\n<p>While still biased against a side, the crowd reserves its most vocal disdain for failed performance combat checks. Unfriendly crowds demoralize combatants in a performance combat. In these battles, while the crowd is unfriendly toward a given side, those combatants take a &ndash;1 penalty on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Indifferent</h2>\n<p>The crowd is waiting for something exciting to happen. Audience members show little emotion other than anticipation and a desire for daring feats of combat to occur.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Friendly</h2>\n<p>The crowd is beginning to be swayed toward one side in the fray. Audience members cheer when that side achieves some impressive feat in the combat, and their reaction grants a +1 morale bonus on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws for their chosen side. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Helpful</h2>\n<p>The crowd loves what it is seeing from a given side. Audience members stand up, chant, cheer, and scream for the combatants to push on toward ultimate success. A helpful crowd grants its chosen champions a +2 morale bonus on all attack rolls, combat maneuver checks, ability checks, skill checks, and saving throws. This is a mind-affecting effect.</p>\n<p>If the crowd is helpful toward one side of the combat and a member of that side succeeds at a performance combat check, that side gains a victory point.</p>"}

Items against Characters}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 535</em></p>\n<p>When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is absolutely true to its alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment&rsquo;s goals or the item&rsquo;s special purpose, personality conf lict&mdash;item against character&mdash;results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree with the item.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw (DC = item&rsquo;s Ego). If the possessor succeeds, she is dominant. If she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for 1 day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to either the item or the character, and so on). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character&rsquo;s desires and demands concessions such as any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.</li>\n<li>The character divesting herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.</li>\n<li>Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.</li>\n<li>Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.</li>\n<li>Magical protections and devices to safeguard the item from molestation when it is not in use.</li>\n<li>That the character carry the item with her on all occasions.</li>\n<li>That the character relinquish the item to a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures, such as the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Force its possessor into combat.</li>\n<li>Refuse to strike opponents.</li>\n<li>Strike at its wielder or her associates.</li>\n<li>Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.</li>\n<li>Cause itself to drop from the character&rsquo;s grasp.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character&rsquo;s and item&rsquo;s alignments or when their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily establish and maintain dominance over him, or a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are natural rivals, even with others of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to share its wielder with others. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60 feet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract their host so that she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might change this sort of behavior.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters that possess them, even though they may never successfully control their possessors. They may be powerless to force their demands, but most remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and demands.</p>"}

Because duels are always planned and expected, there is never a surprise round. Alternatively, some duels start off with each side facing off, waiting for the other to flinch or break resolve. In such cases, substitute a Bluff, Intimidate, or Sense Motive check in place of the standard initiative check. The skill used is decided by the individual participants and is reflective of their approach to the duel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the beginning of each round, the participants check the status of the duel (the GM may want to mark the beginning of each round in some way during initiative tracking as a reminder to check this status). So long as all participants agree to continue dueling, the duel goes on. If any one of the participants withdraws from the duel, the duel immediately ends for all participants, even those who want to see it continue. The participant or side that ended the duel is considered the loser of the duel. The duel&rsquo;s remaining participants can, among themselves, agree to resume the duel, but this is considered a separate duel from the previous one and does not involve those who withdrew from the duel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each participant in a duel can act normally on her turn, but if she casts a spell, that spell must affect or target either herself or one of the other duel participants (whether this participant is an ally or an opponent). For example, a dueling mage could not cast haste on her allies and exclude herself, but she could cast it on herself and her allies. The same goes for offensive spells, such as fireball&mdash;the dueling caster must include one of her opponents in the duel among the targets of the spell, and could not affect some nearby creatures to the exclusion of her opponent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the normal set of actions a dueling caster can perform each round, each participant in a duel may take a special counterspell action called a dueling counter, as noted below.</p>"}

Storms make ranged weapon attacks impossible, except for those using siege weapons, which have a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls. They automatically extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. They cause protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and have a 50% chance to extinguish these lights. See Table 13&ndash;10 for possible consequences to creatures caught outside without shelter during such a storm. Storms are divided into the following three types.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Duststorm (CR 3)</h2>\n<p>These desert storms differ from other storms in that they have no precipitation. Instead, a duststorm blows fine grains of sand that obscure vision, smother unprotected flames, and can even choke protected flames (50% chance). Most duststorms are accompanied by severe winds and leave behind a deposit of 1d6 inches of sand. There is a 10% chance for a greater duststorm to be accompanied by windstorm-magnitude winds (see Table 13&ndash;10). These greater duststorms deal 1d3 points of nonlethal damage each round to anyone caught out in the open without shelter and also pose a choking hazard (see Drowning, except that a character with a scarf or similar protection across her mouth and nose does not begin to choke until after a number of rounds equal to 10 + her Constitution score). Greater duststorms leave 2d3&ndash;1 feet of fine sand in their wake.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Snowstorm</h2>\n<p>In addition to the wind and precipitation common to other storms, snowstorms leave 1d6 inches of snow on the ground afterward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Thunderstorm</h2>\n<p>In addition to wind and precipitation (usually rain, but sometimes also hail), thunderstorms are accompanied by lightning that can pose a hazard to characters without proper shelter (especially those in metal armor). As a rule of thumb, assume one bolt per minute for a 1-hour period at the center of the storm. Each bolt causes between 4d8 and 10d8 points of electricity damage. One in 10 thunderstorms is accompanied by a tornado.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Powerful Storms</h2>\n<p>Very high winds and torrential precipitation reduce visibility to zero, making Perception checks and all ranged weapon attacks impossible. Unprotected flames are automatically extinguished, and protected flames have a 75% chance of being doused. Creatures caught in the area must make a Fortitude save or face the effects based on the size of the creature (see Table 13&ndash;10). Powerful storms are divided into the following four types.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Windstorm</h2>\n<p>While accompanied by little or no precipitation, windstorms can cause considerable damage simply through the force of their winds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Blizzard</h2>\n<p>The combination of high winds, heavy snow (typically 1d3 feet), and bitter cold make blizzards deadly for all who are unprepared for them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hurricane</h2>\n<p>In addition to very high winds and heavy rain, hurricanes are accompanied by floods. Most adventuring activity is impossible under such conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Tornado</h2>\n<p>In addition to incredibly high winds, tornadoes can severely injure and kill those that get pulled into their funnels.</p>"}

Trip}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Combat Maneuver Bonus</h2>\n<p>Each character and creature has a Combat Maneuver Bonus (or CMB) that represents its skill at performing combat maneuvers. A creature&rsquo;s CMB is determined using the following formula:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CMB = Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + special size modifier</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Creatures that are size Tiny or smaller use their Dexterity modifier in place of their Strength modifier to determine their CMB. The special size modifier for a creature&rsquo;s Combat Maneuver Bonus is as follows:</p>\n<p>Fine &ndash;8, Diminutive &ndash;4, Tiny &ndash;2, Small &ndash;1, Medium +0, Large +1, Huge +2, Gargantuan +4, Colossal +8.</p>\n<p>Some feats and abilities grant a bonus to your CMB when performing specific maneuvers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Performing a Combat Maneuver</h2>\n<p>When performing a combat maneuver, you must use an action appropriate to the maneuver you are attempting to perform. While many combat maneuvers can be performed as part of an attack action, full-attack action, or attack of opportunity (in place of a melee attack), others require a specific action. Unless otherwise noted, performing a combat maneuver provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of the maneuver. If you are hit by the target, you take the damage normally and apply that amount as a penalty to the attack roll to perform the maneuver. If your target is immobilized, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated, your maneuver automatically succeeds (treat as if you rolled a natural 20 on the attack roll). If your target is stunned, you receive a +4 bonus on your attack roll to perform a combat maneuver against it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you attempt to perform a combat maneuver, make an attack roll and add your CMB in place of your normal attack bonus. Add any bonuses you currently have on attack rolls due to spells, feats, and other effects. These bonuses must be applicable to the weapon or attack used to perform the maneuver. The DC of this maneuver is your target&rsquo;s Combat Maneuver Defense. Combat maneuvers are attack rolls, so you must roll for concealment and take any other penalties that would normally apply to an attack roll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Combat Maneuver Defense</h2>\n<p>Each character and creature has a Combat Maneuver Defense (or CMD) that represents its ability to resist combat maneuvers. A creature&rsquo;s CMD is determined using the following formula:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>CMD = 10 + Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + Dexterity modifier + special size modifier</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The special size modifier for a creature&rsquo;s Combat Maneuver Defense is as follows:</p>\n<p>Fine &ndash;8, Diminutive &ndash;4, Tiny &ndash;2, Small &ndash;1, Medium +0, Large +1, Huge +2, Gargantuan +4, Colossal +8.</p>\n<p>Some feats and abilities grant a bonus to your CMD when resisting specific maneuvers. A creature can also add any circumstance, deflection, dodge, insight, luck, morale, profane, and sacred bonuses to AC to its CMD. Any penalties to a creature&rsquo;s AC also apply to its CMD. A flat-footed creature does not add its Dexterity bonus to its CMD.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Determine Success</h2>\n<p>If your attack roll equals or exceeds the CMD of the target, your maneuver is a success and has the listed effect. Some maneuvers, such as bull rush, have varying levels of success depending on how much your attack roll exceeds the target&rsquo;s CMD. Rolling a natural 20 while attempting a combat maneuver is always a success (except when attempting to escape from bonds), while rolling a natural 1 is always a failure.</p>"}

Leng}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Occult Adventures pg. 244</em></p>\n<p>Deep within the Astral Plane lies a demiplane called the Akashic Record that forms a critical part of the ancient wisdom at the heart of occult philosophy. The Akashic Record is a visual library of perfect psychic records of every moment in the history of the multiverse. Those who find their way here can observe scenes from any moment from the recent to distant past, going all the way back to the beginning of the multiverse. When a dead creature&rsquo;s untethered astral body sees its life flash before its eyes as it awaits judgment in the Boneyard, its consciousness ventures to the Akashic Record. When a psychometrist divines a touched object&rsquo;s past, he really gains impressions from scenes stored in the Akashic Record.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unlike the history books of mundane existence, the Akashic Record is a perfect recording of events as they actually happened. Two creatures observing the same event in real time might come away with very different subjective understandings of what just occurred, but such confusion is impossible in the Akashic Record, which occultists speak of as the memory of nature. It is also known as the Book of the Lipika by the mysterious cloaked aeons who act as the Lords of Karma and who record every event in a mortal&rsquo;s life to measure its rightful place in the afterlife.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A visitor consulting the Akashic Record simply turns her attention to the moment she wishes to observe, and it appears before her, not as a two-dimensional image like an illustration on page, but rather all around her, as if she were actually present witnessing the desired moment in history. The actors before her are unconscious of her presence, as they are but reflections. The observer can&rsquo;t change or affect their actions in any way.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The observer can set the pace of events. He understands perfectly all communications within the record, even if he would not otherwise understand languages read or spoken, or the importance of cultural norms and signals otherwise foreign to him. If the event in question is from the observer&rsquo;s own life, he may choose to view it as an outsider, or may inhabit his form and live out the event again, re-experiencing the emotions associated with the event the first time around.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Traveling to the Akashic Record, which abuts the mysterious Dimension of Time, is incredibly difficult. Spells that allow for planar travel, such as plane shift, cannot take a seeker to the Akashic Record. While occult lore suggests several methods to &ldquo;enter&rdquo; the Akashic Record and influence the visions seen there (for example, to rescue a character from some past scene and escape with her to the Astral Plane), those doing so risk becoming lost in the currents of the Dimension of Time, marooned in the real past of the observed event, very likely never to return. Such meddling with the affairs of time risks drawing the ire of the Lords of Karma, unleashing retributive time elementals or inevitables, or attracting the bloodthirsty otherworldly predators known as the hounds of Tindalos.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Planar Traits</h2>\n<p>The Akashic Record has the following traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Flowing Time</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Finite Shape</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Static</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Akashic Record is one of the multiverse&rsquo;s greatest mysteries. According to occult lore, the true Akashic Record is a demiplane deep within the Astral Plane that contains all information in the multiverse in a single, vast visual library of psychic experiences collected and guarded by powerful aeons. Supposedly, these psychic records provide perfect and unambiguous understanding of all knowledge, and they present this knowledge on command. The existence of such a location flies in the face of nearly every other philosophy and tradition, including the death of prophecy in the Age of Lost Omens, and it would seem to negate all the mysteries of the multiverse.</p>\n<p>The truth of the Akashic Record is shrouded in its own mysteries and uncertainty. No known spell or ritual allows direct travel to the Akashic Record, and divinations about the demiplane often grant contradictory results.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some occult sources tell tales of those who reached the demiplane by piggybacking off the Dimension of Time. The most reputable of those sources indicate that the planar travelers gained access to a sort of &ldquo;reading room&rdquo; of the Akashic Record&rsquo;s library with limited access to the record&rsquo;s knowledge, under the watchful eyes of lipika aeons. The most extreme tales indicate that the travelers discovered how to alter the record and thus change the past, but supposedly those travelers were lost in the alternate realities their actions created or erased from the timestream.</p>\n<p>According to occult scholars, the crux that holds the Akashic Record together is a danava titan known as the Akashic Guru, a being made nearly invincible by her ability to automatically recall previous versions of herself from the Akashic Record, thereby undoing any injuries she might have sustained&mdash;up to and including her own destruction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As might be expected given the reverence with which occult scholars speak of the Akashic Record, its putative existence serves as a linchpin they use to account for countless phenomena. These range from humble psychometry all the way up to powerful magic that allows the mightiest psychics to emulate imperfectly Akashic Guru&rsquo;s signature power and restore themselves to a version from the past. Even arcane and divine scholars begrudgingly accept the effectiveness of such spells, but they maintain that the mysterious magic that could be explained by accessing the Akashic Record is not necessarily proof of the record&rsquo;s existence.</p>"}

Descriptive Text}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 213</em></p>\n<p>You must make choices about whom a spell is to affect or where an effect is to originate, depending on a spell&rsquo;s type. The next entry in a spell description defines the spell&rsquo;s target (or targets), its effect, or its area, as appropriate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Target or Targets</h2>\n<p>Some spells have a target or targets. You cast these spells on creatures or objects, as defined by the spell itself. You must be able to see or touch the target, and you must specifically choose that target. You do not have to select your target until you finish casting the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the target of a spell is yourself (the Target line of the spell description includes &ldquo;You&rdquo;), you do not receive a saving throw, and spell resistance does not apply. The saving throw and spell resistance lines are omitted from such spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some spells restrict you to willing targets only. Declaring yourself as a willing target is something that can be done at any time (even if you&rsquo;re f lat-footed or it isn&rsquo;t your turn). Unconscious creatures are automatically considered willing, but a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who is bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically willing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some spells allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you cast the spell. Redirecting a spell is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Effect</h2>\n<p>Some spells create or summon things rather than affecting things that are already present.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You must designate the location where these things are to appear, either by seeing it or defining it. Range determines how far away an effect can appear, but if the effect is mobile, after it appears it can move regardless of the spell&rsquo;s range.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ray</h2>\n<p>Some effects are rays. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you make a ranged touch attack rather than a normal ranged attack. As with a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an invisible creature and hope you hit something. You don&rsquo;t have to see the creature you&rsquo;re trying to hit, as you do with a targeted spell. Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of sight or provide cover for the creature at which you&rsquo;re aiming.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a ray spell has a duration, it&rsquo;s the duration of the effect that the ray causes, not the length of time the ray itself persists.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a ray spell deals damage, you can score a critical hit just as if it were a weapon. A ray spell threatens a critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spread</h2>\n<p>Some effects, notably clouds and fogs, spread out from a point of origin, which must be a grid intersection. The effect can extend around corners and into areas that you can&rsquo;t see. Figure distance by actual distance traveled, taking into account turns the spell effect takes. When determining distance for spread effects, count around walls, not through them. As with movement, do not trace diagonals across corners. You must designate the point of origin for such an effect, but you need not have line of effect (see below) to all portions of the effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Area</h2>\n<p>Some spells affect an area. Sometimes a spell description specifies a specially defined area, but usually an area falls into one of the categories defined below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point where the spell originates, but otherwise you don&rsquo;t control which creatures or objects the spell affects. The point of origin of a spell is always a grid intersection. When determining whether a given creature is within the area of a spell, count out the distance from the point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when determining the range for a ranged attack. The only difference is that instead of counting from the center of one square to the center of the next, you count from intersection to intersection.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can count diagonally across a square, but remember that every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of distance. If the far edge of a square is within the spell&rsquo;s area, anything within that square is within the spell&rsquo;s area. If the spell&rsquo;s area only touches the near edge of a square, however, anything within that square is unaffected by the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Burst, Emanation, or Spread</h2>\n<p>Most spells that affect an area function as a burst, an emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select the spell&rsquo;s point of origin and measure its effect from that point.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A burst spell affects whatever it catches in its area, including creatures that you can&rsquo;t see. It can&rsquo;t affect creatures with total cover from its point of origin (in other words, its effects don&rsquo;t extend around corners). The default shape for a burst effect is a sphere, but some burst spells are specifically described as cone-shaped. A burst&rsquo;s area defines how far from the point of origin the spell&rsquo;s effect extends.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An emanation spell functions like a burst spell, except that the effect continues to radiate from the point of origin for the duration of the spell. Most emanations are cones or spheres.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A spread spell extends out like a burst but can turn corners. You select the point of origin, and the spell spreads out a given distance in all directions. Figure the area the spell effect fills by taking into account any turns the spell effect takes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cone, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere</h2>\n<p>Most spells that affect an area have a particular shape.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A cone-shaped spell shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either bursts or emanations (see above), and thus won&rsquo;t go around corners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When casting a cylinder-shaped spell, you select the spell&rsquo;s point of origin. This point is the center of a horizontal circle, and the spell shoots down from the circle, filling a cylinder. A cylinder-shaped spell ignores any obstructions within its area.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A line-shaped spell shoots away from you in a line in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and extends to the limit of its range or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of effect. A line-shaped spell affects all creatures in squares through which the line passes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A sphere-shaped spell expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres may be bursts, emanations, or spreads.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Creatures</h2>\n<p>A spell with this kind of area affects creatures directly (like a targeted spell), but it affects all creatures in an area of some kind rather than individual creatures you select. The area might be a spherical burst, a cone-shaped burst, or some other shape.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many spells affect &ldquo;living creatures,&rdquo; which means all creatures other than constructs and undead. Creatures in the spell&rsquo;s area that are not of the appropriate type do not count against the creatures affected.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Objects</h2>\n<p>A spell with this kind of area affects objects within an area you select (as Creatures, but affecting objects instead).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Other</h2>\n<p>A spell can have a unique area, as defined in its description.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>(S) Shapeable</h2>\n<p>If an area or effect entry ends with &ldquo;(S),&rdquo; you can shape the spell. A shaped effect or area can have no dimension smaller than 10 feet. Many effects or areas are given as cubes to make it easy to model irregular shapes. Three-dimensional volumes are most often needed to define aerial or underwater effects and areas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Line of Effect</h2>\n<p>A line of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a spell can affect. A line of effect is canceled by a solid barrier. It&rsquo;s like line of sight for ranged weapons, except that it&rsquo;s not blocked by fog, darkness, and other factors that limit normal sight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You must have a clear line of effect to any target that you cast a spell on or to any space in which you wish to create an effect. You must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of any spell you cast.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A burst, cone, cylinder, or emanation spell affects only an area, creature, or object to which it has line of effect from its origin (a spherical burst&rsquo;s center point, a coneshaped burst&rsquo;s starting point, a cylinder&rsquo;s circle, or an emanation&rsquo;s point of origin).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does not block a spell&rsquo;s line of effect. Such an opening means that the 5-foot length of wall containing the hole is no longer considered a barrier for purposes of a spell&rsquo;s line of effect.</p>"}

A proximity trigger differs from a location trigger in that the creature need not be standing in a particular square. Creatures that are flying can spring a trap with a proximity trigger but not one with a location trigger. Mechanical proximity triggers are extremely sensitive to the slightest change in the air. This makes them useful only in places such as crypts, where the air is unusually still.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The proximity trigger used most often for magic device traps is the alarm spell. Unlike when the spell is cast, an alarm spell used as a trigger can have an area that&rsquo;s no larger than the area the trap is meant to protect. Some magic device traps have special proximity triggers that activate only when certain kinds of creatures approach. For example, a detect good spell can serve as a proximity trigger on an evil altar, springing the attached trap only when someone of good alignment gets close enough to it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sound</h2>\n<p>This trigger springs a magic trap when it detects any sound. A sound trigger functions like an ear and has a +15 bonus on Perception checks. A successful Stealth check, magical silence, and other effects that would negate hearing defeat it. A trap with a sound trigger requires the casting of clairaudience during its construction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Visual</h2>\n<p>This trigger for magic traps works like an actual eye, springing the trap whenever it &ldquo;sees&rdquo; something. A trap with a visual trigger requires the casting of arcane eye, clairvoyance, or true seeing during its construction. Sight range and the Perception bonus conferred on the trap depend on the spell chosen, as shown.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">Spell</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Sight Ranges</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Perception Bonus</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Arcane eye</td>\n<td>Line of sight (unlimited range)</td>\n<td>+20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Clairvoyance</td>\n<td>One preselected location</td>\n<td>+15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>True seeing</td>\n<td>Line of sight (up to 120 ft.)</td>\n<td>+30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If you want the trap to see in the dark, you must either choose the&nbsp;true seeing&nbsp;option or add&nbsp;darkvision&nbsp;to the trap as well. (Darkvision&nbsp;limits the trap&rsquo;s sight range in the dark to 60 feet.) If invisibility, disguises, or illusions can fool the spell being used, they can fool the visual trigger as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Touch</h2>\n<p>A touch trigger, which springs the trap when touched, is one of the simplest kinds of trigger to construct. This trigger may be physically attached to the part of the mechanism that deals the damage or it may not. You can make a magic touch trigger by adding alarm to the trap and reducing the area of the effect to cover only the trigger spot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Timed</h2>\n<p>This trigger periodically springs the trap after a certain duration has passed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell</h2>\n<p>All spell traps have this kind of trigger.

When bound, they often bargain for terms for their service and release in good faith with good-aligned binders, but attempt to trick and coerce evil-aligned ones.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As agathions are intensely proud of their beastlike shapes, summoners who insult their forms or imply that they are somehow lycanthropic take a &ndash;4 penalty on all Charisma checks when dealing with a bound agathion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Agathions are immune to electricity and petrification. They have resistance to cold 10 and sonic 10, and a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against poison. They are vulnerable to unholy weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Avoral (SR 20)</h2>\n<p>Often bound to serve as spies and scouts, avorals delight in the challenge of such activities when bound, as long as the cause is just and worthy of their attention. They hate being confined, so evil-aligned or neutral-aligned binders typically use imprisonment as punishment or coercion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cetaceal (SR 26)</h2>\n<p>Protectors of good aquatic races, cetaceals are often called and bound by good spellcasters for protection of aquatic territories and to serve as ambassadors or emissaries. Unscrupulous binders often make deals with cetaceals on dry land, only letting them roam the water when a bargain for service is reached.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Draconal (SR 31)</h2>\n<p>Powerful, haughty, and removed from mortal affairs, these direct agents of the gods are often aggravating to deal with once bound. Patient pursuers of long-term plans, many draconals seek to wait out mortal spellcasters rather than bargain for their services. Those who wish to bind and use the power of a draconal must be epically powerful and have perfect timing, know the draconal&rsquo;s true name, or be lucky enough to have plans running in concert with the agathion&rsquo;s goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Leonal (SR 23)</h2>\n<p>Coveted as bound protectors and hunters, leonals are often straightforward in their negotiations with binders. They desire simple (and good) goals, as well as definitive terms for release from their obligations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Silvanshee (SR 13)</h2>\n<p>Curious but cautious, silvanshees are often bound as familiars by neutral good spellcasters. Sometimes large groups of them are summoned and bound by powerful spellcasters to serve as spies and scouts, especially in cities where they can meld into cat populations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vulpinal (SR 17)</h2>\n<p>These foxlike agathions deal with those who bind them into service with an outspoken friendliness. They often bluntly state their dissatisfaction with their current fate in the most diplomatic terms, frequently accompanied by a smile and a wink. They prefer to be used as messengers and emissaries in the service of good, and if bound for any other purpose, they trick their way into the resolution of their bargains as quickly as possible.</p>"}

Sometimes a driving mechanism may have its own requirements for use. The driver uses that mechanism and her skill (or her Wisdom) to control the vehicle.

These half-elves show their parentage on their faces, with sandy, russet, or green-black skin to match their elven parent. Slightly webbed fingers and toes aid in swimming, but their neck slits almost never function as gills. A few aquatic half-elves can breathe underwater and live with their elven parents, but far more shoreborn live on land, feeling a constant call to the water. Many find work as sailors. Fishing vessels and merchant ships often have shoreborn deckhands and first mates, and a crew made up solely of aquatic half-elves sails an infamous pirate ship known as the Shoreline Scourge.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Ekujae Half-Elves (Wildborn)</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Heroes from the Fringe pg. 20</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bastards of Golarion pg. 6</em><br />The half-elves of the Mwangi Expanse have the dark skin of their Ekujae parents, but they tend to be closer in stature and build to their human parents, allowing wildborn to pass for human more easily than most of their fellow half-elves. These half-elves are equally at home in the wilds of the jungle or arranging trade deals in the larger Mwangi cities. While some Ekujae raise their wildborn children, others ritually turn over their half-elven offspring to specific half-elven villages within their Mwangi nation. The adult wildborn of these villages seek out and accept any of these children who might have fallen through the cracks, raising them with respect for both the wilderness and society. Even a few half-elves from other backgrounds travel to the Mwangi Expanse to join these villages, finding acceptance they can&rsquo;t get anywhere else. The members of these villages protect their homes fiercely, and few dare attack them.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Elf-Raised</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Advanced Race Guide pg. 42</em><br />These half-elves represent those embraced by their elven relatives, and raised with all of the traditional cultural training and education typical of most full-blooded elves.

Those half-drow who are not crushed by persecution are forced to age into particularly strong and independent adults. Some give into bitterness from their upbringing, becoming hardened assassins or wanton killers. Others deliberately rebel against their brutal childhoods, becoming righteous warriors against evil. Either way, half-drow fight fiercely to the very last. Darkborn have the gray skin and light-colored hair of the drow but have human-looking eyes, and they have a more difficult time appearing fully elven or human than most half-elves do.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Human-Raised</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Advanced Race Guide pg. 42</em><br />These half-elves were born and raised into accepting human communities, often raised by generations of a single family, or through the charity of churches and temples.

Their offspring, the Spireborn, only come about when Mordant Spire elves travel to human villages. Spireborn half-elves are almost always taken back to the Mordant Spire by their elven parent, and they are usually trained from youth to go on important missions outside of the Mordant Spire. Spireborn undergo both physical training and extensive education on the Azlanti. They tell no one they meet on their travels of their heritage or their top-secret duties.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Snowcaster Half-Elves (Snowborn)</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Heroes from the Fringe pg. 21</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bastards of Golarion pg. 7</em><br />Found throughout the northern countries, snowborn are typically the children of twilight speakers&mdash;religious envoys from the normally distrustful Snowcaster clans, who consider it a sacred duty to befriend humans and other non-elves. Snowcaster clans vary in their acceptance of these children, but the average clan&rsquo;s seclusion from humanity and inability to understand half-elves almost invariably ends up driving the snowborn away. Twilight speakers, however, tend to enjoy a particularly close relationship with their snowborn children, and the two groups often wander together. Snowborn have their elven parents&rsquo; snowy white skin and particularly sharp ears. Some Snowcaster half-elves find welcome homes among the Jadwiga and Ulfen communities, as well as the Erutaki tribes. Others wander, looking for a permanent place to belong.</p>"}

It both provides a starting point for character creation and sets the tone for a character as it progresses. Race mixes biology and culture, then translates those concepts into racial traits. Yet since both biology and culture are mutable&mdash;especially when one considers the powerful forces of magic&mdash;racial traits can be so diverse that two elves can be extremely different while still manifesting aspects of their shared heritage and culture. A race&rsquo;s traits, its history, its relations with other races, and the culture that all of these things imply&mdash;all of these frame your character. This is true whether you play to or against the stereotypes. A savage and bloodthirsty half-orc who lives only for battle is fun to play, but so is a stern and conflicted half-orc paladin constantly struggling to keep her bloodlust in check. Both fit comfortably within the theme of half-orc, but come off as very different characters around the game table.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Below are listed the Race who have Subraces available to them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.4I0MRvyVwdGUbqsE]{1.2.7.01.

This dark gray metal is the material of choice for hulls and starship superstructures, and is what constitutes the walls, floors, and ceilings of the strange ruins found throughout Numeria. Without more advanced technology, glaucite is extremely difficult to work with. Because the metal isn&rsquo;t much better than steel for forging weapons or armor, and the process of extracting the adamantine from it is so expensive and time consuming that the resulting adamantine isn&rsquo;t worth the effort, Numerian scavengers have, by and large, left the walls and floors of the structures buried in the region untouched. It&rsquo;s simply easier to scavenge smaller objects or work with normal iron or steel in the long run.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Glaucite has 30 hit points per inch of thickness (the same as steel) and hardness 15. It is half again as heavy as steel, and the difficulty of working with the material triples the object&rsquo;s total cost to create. As a result, glaucite armor and weapons are generally commissioned only by eccentrics and collectors and rarely see use in the field, given that steel weapons and armor work just as well and are less encumbering.</p>"}

These elves have developed gills and webbed fingers and toes that allow them to survive and navigate the waters of Golarion, and often have blue, coral, or seaweed-black skin to blend into their environment. A significant number of aquatic elves live in the Steaming Sea near Mordant Spire, and in the Arcadian Ocean. Aquatic elves typically live secluded lives, either on their own or in small communities, though groups of aquatic elves that interact with land-dwelling communities are not uncommon.

Ekujae elves reside within the Mwangi Expanse in hidden jungle villages so interwoven with the surrounding trees that the buildings there are overlooked even by travelers passing within a few hundred feet them. Unlike many of the elves of Avistan, the Ekujae remained on Golarion despite the calamity of Earthfall and tell tales of having defeated a &ldquo;Great Darkness&rdquo; after the disaster. They still hone their skills for war and are ever ready to fight the Darkness if it returns. Due to this ancient responsibility, Ekujae hold to strict traditions in many matters, including the burying of their fallen and the act of swearing oaths and ritualized agreements.<br /><br />Like other elves, Ekujae have keen intellects and are skilled in magical lore, including what has been passed down through their oral traditions and the numerous secrets of the Mwangi Expanse. They often journey to the Magaambya to study magic or to share their knowledge with that academy&rsquo;s students.

Forlorn elves often watch many of their friends and family die before their first century is past. Some Forlorn have adopted a variety of unhealthy coping mechanisms as a result, such as recklessness or substance abuse; others develop antisocial tendencies and keep others at arm&rsquo;s length to avoid the pain of loss. Still others learn to accept the brevity of the lives around them, cherishing what time they have with friends while they still have it.<br /><br />Forlorn are the most common wanderers of elvenkind, whether they&rsquo;re traveling widely to avoid attachment or relishing travel with short-lived companions, and many become adventurers. Some find their way to elven lands, where their kin sympathetically welcome them, while others avoid such places out of bitterness or fear of rejection.

Jininese elves have adopted many of the customs of their human and samsaran neighbors&mdash;Jinin&rsquo;s culture places great emphasis on artistic pursuits, especially those involving mithral, which serves as a national symbol, lucrative export, and treasured cultural relic for Jininese elves.

Their loyalty to their homes borders on religious reverence, whether they are ancestral burial grounds, ancient elven ruins, or simply places they&rsquo;ve chosen as their own. Snowcasters rarely journey outside their homes or meet with outsiders. The primary exceptions to this are the twilight speakers, who serve as emissaries to the outside world. Less commonly, Snowcasters who have been exiled, who have lost their homes to monsters, or who are simply overcome with wanderlust may journey to the outside world to seek a new life.<br /><br />Snowcasters frequently have the desert runner, elemental resistance (cold), and fleet-footed alternate racial traits; a few have the frostmelding alternate racial trait described below.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Spiresworn Elves</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Heroes from the Fringe pg. 11</em><br />The Mordant Spire&rsquo;s elves, with their eerie masks and off-putting mannerisms, are a mystery to most Avistani. These elves have sworn to prevent exploration of Azlant in order to preserve and isolate the remnants of the Azlanti culture and protect Golarion from another Earthfall. The reclusive Spiresworn use enchantment and water magic to dissuade explorers; they resort to violent or deadly means only with utmost reluctance. In recent years, some younger Spiresworn have begun to question their isolationist traditions. While their commitment to protecting Azlant remains firm, a growing segment of Spiresworn believe that there is much to gain from interaction with the wider world.

This dream avatar is known as the lucid body, and can take a variety of forms based on the dreamer&rsquo;s subconsciousness. The minds of the countless dreamers of the Material Plane brush up against the Ethereal Plane, bubbling forth ephemeral demiplanes in which the dreamers&rsquo; lucid bodies experience fantastic adventures inspired by their own unconscious minds. A dreamer can alter her surroundings, and one with the Lucid Dreamer feat gains a greater measure of control. Spells cast and items used in a dream are not depleted in the real world. Wounds and conditions don&rsquo;t have any effect on the creature&rsquo;s waking body and mind. Fantastic adventures don&rsquo;t yield real treasure or experience to the waking being, though knowledge gained in the Dimension of Dreams occasionally aids in solving real challenges faced in the waking world. Even the worst nightmares hold little true danger for the dreamer. Should the lucid body die, the dreamer simply awakens, perhaps a bit shaken but otherwise little worse for the experience. A creature with the Lucid Dreamer feat awakens from such an experience fatigued, as her mind is more invested in perceptions of the dreamscape.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Experience in a dreamscape is usually a private affair. Rare spells (such as dream council), magic items, and other abilities allow creatures to enter and share another creature&rsquo;s dream demiplane for a short amount of time. While these secondary dreamers can interact with the highly morphic qualities of the plane, with the primary dreamer, and with each other, the existence of the demiplane is still contingent on a single primary dreamer. When the primary dreamer awakens, the demiplane pops out of existence, causing any other dreamers to continue dreaming&mdash;shunted into a dreamscape of their own creation&mdash;or to wake up.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A lucid body is not the only way to enter a dream, however, and considerable danger faces the explorer who enters the Dimension of Dreams in his physical body. Regular methods of planar travel like plane shift do not offer transit to the dream world&mdash;only specialized means such as the dream travel spell do the trick. When a physical creature enters a dreamscape, he doesn&rsquo;t have to make the check to determine his initial state, but also can&rsquo;t attempt impossible feats (see below). Spells cast, magic items used, and other limited abilities expended are lost just as if the creature were adventuring on some other plane. Creatures in their material forms can use items generated within a dreamscape, but these items wink out of existence when the primary dreamer awakens, or when a creature in material form leaves the dreamscape. Wounds and experiences are real, and remain after the creature leaves the dreamscape. A creature in its physical form that dies within a dream demiplane actually dies. Material creatures still within a dreamscape when the primary dreamer awakens are pushed into an abutting dreamscape or regions of the Ethereal Plane that border the Dimension of Dreams.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although each dreamer&rsquo;s slumbering soul conjures a personal demiplane dreamscape that manifests on the Ethereal Plane, all dreams collectively belong to the greater network of the Dimension of Dreams. When numerous dreamscapes cluster in the ethereal fog, transit between dreams is easier, and moods, emotions, and even creatures from one dream spill more easily into another. Where the individual dreamscapes brush up against the little-understood Dimension of Time, dreams often take on prophetic elements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Figments from the dream world sometimes manage to escape the Dimension of Dreams, usually at the moment when a particularly imaginative sleeper awakens, and the reality of the dream is at its weakest as the demiplane fades away. These weird, shifting creatures stalk the Ethereal Plane as animate dreams, feeding off the minds of mortals, searching for other dreams in which to take refuge and torment a new sleeper.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A class of vile so-called &ldquo;nightmare creatures&rdquo; infests the Dimension of Dreams, venturing from dreamscape to dreamscape hunting victims to torment and destroy. A hierarchy of horror known as the Nightmare Lords rules over lesser nightmare creatures in puppet courts staffed by the soul-shriveled husks of insane enslaved dreamers. Somehow, these creatures have even found a way to manifest on the Material Plane, not content to limit their terrors to the realm of sleep.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Night hags are among the most harrowing threats of the Dimension of Dreams. They walk freely between dreams, searching for chaotic or evil dreamers, on whose backs they ride until morning. Creatures they encounter between dreams or dwelling within the dreamscapes of their prey are simply cut down, regardless of alignment. Night hags collect the souls of their slain enemies in gemstones they sell to clientele throughout the planes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although most dreamscapes are ephemeral, fading when the sleeper awakens, particularly potent dreamscapes, bolstered by recurrence or by the shared subconscious of numerous dreamers, sometimes last forever. Among the most formidable and permanent regions of the Dimension of Dreams is the bizarre realm of Leng, where near-human denizens sail ethereal seas in black-hulled ships packed with slaves bound for the dark markets of the multiverse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Planar Traits</h2>\n<p>The Dimension of Dreams has the following traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Flowing Time</strong></p>\n<p>Both lucid bodies and creatures visiting the Dimension of Dream with their physical bodies are subject to the flowing time trait of a given dreamscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Highly Morphic</strong></p>\n<p>When a creature enters a dreamscape with a lucid body, it must make a Charisma check (DC 15) to prevent arriving in the Dimension of Dreams at a disadvantage, such as without important equipment or on the side of an arctic mountain during an avalanche. A successful save means the dreamer manifests in perfect health, with all of its regular equipment (spells and magic items used in a dream are not actually expended in the real world). Even in the worst of circumstances, however, the lucid body is capable of fantastic&mdash;even impossible&mdash;feats.</p>\n<p>As a standard action, a number of times during the dream equal to the creature&rsquo;s Charisma bonus (minimum 1) the dreamer can attempt one impossible action, such as casting a spell, gaining an effect of a spell as if it were cast, or conjuring a magic item. This requires a successful Charisma check (DC 10 + the level of the spell being cast or spell effect replicated or half of the caster level of the item conjured; nonmagical items are caster level 0). Other fantastic feats are also possible with GM approval and a Charisma check with a DC determined by the GM. If the check fails, the dreamer cannot perform the feat. Creatures that enter the dream with their physical bodies do not need to make the initial check and do not gain the ability to create items and spell effects or perform other fantastic feats, but must otherwise deal with the strange realities of the dreamscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Wild Magic</strong></p>\n<p>Both lucid bodies and creatures visiting the Dimension of Dream with their physical bodies are subject to the wild magic of dreamscapes.</p>"}

How Planes Interact}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 440</em></p>\n<p>The Ethereal Plane is a ghostly realm that exists as a buffer between the Material Plane and the Shadow Plane, overlapping each. A traveler in the Ethereal plane experiences the real world as if the world were an insubstantial ghost, and can move through solid objects without being seen in the real world. Strange creatures dwell in the Ethereal Plane, as well as ghosts and dreams, many of which can sometimes extend their influence into the real world in mysterious and terrifying ways. Powerful spellcasters utilize the Ethereal Plane with spells like blink, etherealness, and ethereal jaunt.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>GameMastery Guide pg. 191</em></p>\n<p>The Ethereal Plane is coexistent with the Material Plane and often other planes as well. The Material Plane itself is visible from the Ethereal Plane, but it appears muted and indistinct; colors blur into each other and edges are fuzzy.</p>\n<p>While it is possible to see into the Material Plane from the Ethereal Plane, the latter is usually invisible to those on the Material Plane. Normally, creatures on the Ethereal Plane cannot attack creatures on the Material Plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the Ethereal Plane is invisible, insubstanial, and utterly silent to someone on the Material Plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Planar Traits</h2>\n<p>The Ethereal Plane has the following traits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No Gravity</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Alterable Morphic</strong>: The plane contains little to alter, however.</li>\n<li><strong>Mildly Neutral-Aligned</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Normal Magic</strong>: Spells function normally on the Ethereal Plane, though they do not cross into the Material Plane. The only exceptions are spells and spell-like abilities that have the force descriptor and abjuration spells that affect ethereal beings; these can cross from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane. Spellcasters on the Material Plane must have some way to detect foes on the Ethereal Plane before targeting them with force-based spells. While it&rsquo;s possible to hit ethereal enemies with a force spell cast on the Material Plane, the reverse isn&rsquo;t possible. No magical attacks cross from the Ethereal Plane to the Material Plane, including force attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Occult Adventures pg. 240</em></p>\n<p>The Ethereal Plane is the seat of emotional forces, the mist-shrouded home of haunts and horrors, and the ever-present doorway between the worlds of the Inner Sphere. The Ethereal Plane coexists with these planes, interpenetrating them and generally mimicking their contours and vistas, albeit with greatly reduced visibility thanks to drifting fog and the slow rise and fall of fading sheets of light like the somber interior of a thunderstorm. From within the Ethereal Plane, these neighboring worlds appear hazy and indistinct, as if viewed through frosted glass. Inhabitants of neighboring planes can&rsquo;t perceive the Ethereal Plane at all, though certain mortals blessed or cursed with psychic sensitivity sometimes catch glimpses of its vistas. Since the Ethereal Plane is generally invisible from the other planes of the Inner Sphere, creatures under the effects of spells like ethereal jaunt and etherealness cannot be seen by creatures who are not themselves ethereal. Normally, creatures on the Ethereal Plane cannot attack creatures on the Material Plane, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Within the mists of the Ethereal Plane, warped, indistinct versions of locations overlap their Inner Sphere counterparts. This, coupled with the inherent weightlessness of creatures in the plane, makes it tempting to use the Ethereal Plane as a vantage to scout out unknown locales by passing through incorporeal walls and floating over traps with ease. The natural denizens of the plane make this a frightful prospect, however, and ensure that most forays into the Ethereal Plane are brief endeavors. Among the deadliest of local hazards are the blood-red xill&mdash;warlike, plane-shifting outsiders who incubate their eggs in living mortals. Worse still, hideous, cackling night hags use the Ethereal Plane as a byway to the Dimension of Dreams, where they slip into nightmares to abduct mortal souls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The twisted remnants of mortal souls comprise the vast majority of the Ethereal Plane&rsquo;s inhabitants. Some souls, freed from their physical bodies by death, remain tethered to the Ethereal Plane by profound emotional distress and cannot proceed along multiversal currents to join the River of Souls flowing inexorably toward the Boneyard until they sever the powerful emotional ties that bind them. Indeed, the longer these souls remain stalled on their afterlife journey, the closer they slide toward the Negative Energy Plane, and the more of their memories and personalities become subsumed by raw emotional distress and psychic damage. These souls eventually manifest as incorporeal undead, frequently in the form of wraiths and spectres.</p>\n<p>Spiritualists call out to the spirits of the Ethereal Plane and open their physical minds as refuges for them to inhabit. With practice and the help of a trained spiritualist, a spirit can even take its own physical form on the neighboring planes by cloaking itself in a sheath of ectoplasm, the ghostly substance that acts as a veil between worlds. These spirit guides are known as phantoms, and while they are loyal to the spiritualist to whom they are bound, the emotional connection to the Ethereal Plane remains strong, manifesting in jealousy and fiery outbursts from even the kindest of souls. The ectoplasmic nature of the Ethereal Plane is extraordinarily susceptible to the thoughts and emotions of the plane&rsquo;s inhabitants. The ethereal version of a physical location is informed not just by its actual dimensions and appearance, but also by the memories and impressions of the spirits that haunt it.</p>\n<p>For example, on the Ethereal Plane, an old mansion might look as it did in the era of its ghostly inhabitants. If those spirits find final rest, their memories cannot sustain the structure, and it falls into an ethereal ruin. Some incorporeal spirits become so entwined with the emotional nature of the plane that they can manifest these ectoplasmic vistas in an overlapping location on a neighboring plane, temporarily cloaking it in a disturbing reflection of some past incarnation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a similar way that locations in the outside world possess overlapping etheric reflections, mortal creatures also have ethereal doppelgangers in the form of etheric doubles that exactly overlie their physical forms. The etheric double is a vessel for the cosmic breath of life that gives a creature animate force, most commonly known as ki. This energy collects in seven blazing vortices of colorful energy known as chakras, which bind the etheric double and the physical body together and distribute vital life energy to both. This energy extends 2 to 3 feet beyond the outlines of the creature&rsquo;s physical form to create its aura, a nimbus of colorful occult energies that reveals much about a creature&rsquo;s disposition and emotional state.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A creature&rsquo;s etheric double, aura, and chakras are not visible except to those with the knowledge or magic to see them. From the Material Plane, this involves esoteric use of the Perception skill by a creature with the Psychic Sensitivity feat or any of a number of spells. From within the Ethereal Plane, all it takes to observe the interplay of these forces is simple concentration&mdash; if you know what to look for, it becomes plainly visible. Interpreting this information, of course, is another matter. An etheric double is outlined in violet-gray or blue-gray luminescence. Unlike an astral body generated by astral projection or a lucid body of the Dimension of Dreams, an etheric double is not normally capable of acting as a separate vehicle of consciousness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, the sweeping expanse of the Ethereal Plane is home to countless pocket realities known as demiplanes. Many of these unique realms are the private domains of powerful arcane spellcasters, the playgrounds of minor gods, the experiments of the inscrutable elohim, or the prisons of creatures that pose such danger to the cosmos that they must never be released.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Denizens</h2>\n<p>Despite its barren emptiness, the Ethereal Plane is far from uninhabited. The most notorious of its denizens are the xills, blood-red planar marauders with the power to step into the Material Plane and abduct creatures to serve as living hosts for their eggs. These alien outsiders have a tyrannical military culture and see all other creatures as fodder for their expansion&mdash;particularly phase spiders, a race that the xills have warred against for eons. Vile sahkils move through the Ethereal Plane as well, seeping out from the nightmare realm to torment the mortal world, and while they are most at home in that demiplane, they are disturbingly common foes across the Ethereal Plane as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These are far from the only creatures lurking in the mists, however. Aether elementals twist and dance in places where the Elemental Planes brush close to the Ethereal Plane, mighty etheric dragons lurk in secluded holdings, and phase spiders spin their twisted web settlements when not battling against their xill enemies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unfettered phantoms wander the mists, desperately seeking escape from the ravenous entropy of the Negative Energy Plane, while the enigmatic caulborn sift memories and secrets from mortal emotions. Animate dreams that have escaped from the countless dreamscapes floating through the Ethereal Plane, along with more dangerous nightmare creatures, wander the mists serving their own strange intentions. And though they are more commonly associated with the evil-aligned planes, night hags stalk the Ethereal Plane (often riding atop their nightmare steeds) in search of dreaming mortals to prey upon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Xevnorvex</h3>\n<p>The eerie creatures known as caulborn have long wandered the planes searching for psychic energies and new lore to add to their collective minds. As the Ethereal Plane is rich in both, it is no surprise that the caulborn first emerged into reality. Today, the caulborn primarily dwell on the Material Plane, but their Ethereal fortress, Xevnorvex, is every bit as strange and off-putting as its creators&mdash;a vast, grublike life-form that bears obvious kinship to the caulborn, wriggling its way through the misty void. Its insides are a mix of raw brain tissue used for memory accumulation and organic chambers suitable for caulborn habitation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Divinities</h2>\n<p>Few deities are known to make their homes in the mists of the Ethereal Plane, for there is little of substance to claim, and the lack of large quantities of quintessence limits options for expanding divine realms. Sahkil tormentors dwell in one of the largest demiplanes drifting within the Ethereal Plane. The only real exception is a patron of night hags who has long dwelled on the Ethereal Plane to be closer to the dreams of mortals and gods alike. Many night hags believe that her continued presence is one of the things that gives them power over dreaming mortals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Movement on the Ethereal Plane</h2>\n<p>The Ethereal Plane&rsquo;s lack of gravity and near-total absence of solid matter would normally make movement close to impossible; however, as a result of its psychic resonance, creatures can move themselves through the plane via a sustained force of will. This requires the same action as regular movement, but the creature only moves at half its normal base speed (or one-quarter its normal speed if it lacks an Intelligence score). A creature with a swim or burrow speed can use that speed to determine its halved movement rate instead.</p>\n<p>Creatures capable of flight or whose movement is based on non-terrestrial means such as ectoplasmic gliding can move at their full speed. Movement in this fashion is a purely mental action, and a creature that is paralyzed can still move normally in this manner. Any effect that prevents thought components from functioning also prevents movement in this way on the Ethereal Plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vision in the Ethereal Plane</h2>\n<p>The ever-present mist and fog on the Ethereal Plane give the realm an eerie, gray-green glow such that true darkness is rare, but the mist also distorts and obscures line of sight beyond 300 feet. From this distance to a distance of 900 feet, creatures and objects are visible as blurry, indistinct shapes in the mist and gain concealment. Beyond 900 feet, vision is obscured completely, although certain immense objects may be visible as lighter or darker shapes in the mist at great distance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abilities that allow for sight through mist or fog grant the ability to see normally, yet this does nothing to change the fact that there is rarely anything of import to see in this mostly empty realm.</p>"}

If something interrupts your concentration while you&rsquo;re casting, you must make a concentration check or lose the spell. When you make a concentration check, you roll d20 and add your caster level and the ability score modifier used to determine bonus spells of the same type. Clerics, druids, and rangers add their Wisdom modifier. Bards, paladins, and sorcerers add their Charisma modifier. Finally, wizards add their Intelligence modifier. The more distracting the interruption and the higher the level of the spell you are trying to cast, the higher the DC (see Table 9&ndash;1). If you fail the check, you lose the spell just as if you had cast it to no effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Injury</h2>\n<p>If you take damage while trying to cast a spell, you must make a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + the damage taken + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting. If you fail the check, you lose the spell without effect. The interrupting event strikes during spellcasting if it comes between the time you started and the time you complete a spell (for a spell with a casting time of 1 full round or more) or if it comes in response to your casting the spell (such as an attack of opportunity provoked by the spell or a contingent attack, such as a readied action).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are taking continuous damage, such as from an acid arrow or by standing in a lake of lava, half the damage is considered to take place while you are casting a spell. You must make a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the damage that the continuous source last dealt + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting. If the last damage dealt was the last damage that the effect could deal, then the damage is over and does not distract you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell</h2>\n<p>If you are affected by a spell while attempting to cast a spell of your own, you must make a concentration check or lose the spell you are casting. If the spell affecting you deals damage, the DC is 10 + the damage taken + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the spell interferes with you or distracts you in some other way, the DC is the spell&rsquo;s saving throw DC + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting. For a spell with no saving throw, it&rsquo;s the DC that the spell&rsquo;s saving throw would have if a save were allowed (10 + spell level + caster&rsquo;s ability score).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Grappled or Pinned</h2>\n<p>Casting a spell while you have the grappled or pinned condition is difficult and requires a concentration check (DC 10 + the grappler&rsquo;s CMB + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting). Pinned creatures can only cast spells that do not have somatic components.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vigorous Motion</h2>\n<p>If you are riding on a moving mount, taking a bouncy ride in a wagon, on a small boat in rough water, belowdecks in a storm-tossed ship, or simply being jostled in a similar fashion, you must make a concentration check (DC 10 + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting) or lose the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Violent Motion</h2>\n<p>If you are on a galloping horse, taking a very rough ride in a wagon, on a small boat in rapids or in a storm, on deck in a storm-tossed ship, or being pitched roughly about in a similar fashion, you must make a concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting) or lose the spell. If the motion is extremely violent, such as that caused by an earthquake, the DC is equal to 20 + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Violent Weather</h2>\n<p>You must make a concentration check if you try to cast a spell in violent weather. If you are in a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet, the DC is 5 + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting. If you are in wind-driven hail, dust, or debris, the DC is 10 + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting. In either case, you lose the spell if you fail the concentration check. If the weather is caused by a spell, use the rules as described in the spell&rsquo;s description.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Casting Defensively</h2>\n<p>If you want to cast a spell without provoking any attacks of opportunity, you must make a concentration check (DC 15 + double the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting) to succeed. You lose the spell if you fail.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Entangled</h2>\n<p>If you want to cast a spell while entangled in a net or by a tanglefoot bag or while you&rsquo;re affected by a spell with similar effects, you must make a concentration check to cast the spell (DC 15 + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting). You lose the spell if you fail.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 9-1: Concentration Check DCs</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 79.5216%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 57.1848%;\" scope=\"col\">Situation</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.0821%;\" scope=\"col\">Concentration Check DC</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 57.1848%;\">Cast defensively</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.0821%;\">15 + double spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 57.1848%;\">Injured while casting</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.0821%;\">10 + damage dealt + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 57.1848%;\">Continuous damage while casting</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.0821%;\">10 + 1/2 damage dealt + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 57.1848%;\">Affected by a non-damaging spell while casting</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.0821%;\">DC of the spell + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 57.1848%;\">Grappled or pinned while casting</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.0821%;\">10 + grappler's CMB + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 57.1848%;\">Vigorous motion while casting</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.0821%;\">10 + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 57.1848%;\">Violent motion while casting</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.0821%;\">15 + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 57.1848%;\">Extremely violent motion while casting</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.0821%;\">20 + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 57.1848%;\">Wind with rain or sleet while casting</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.0821%;\">5 + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 57.1848%;\">Wind with hail and debris while casting</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.0821%;\">10 + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 57.1848%;\">Weather caused by spell</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.0821%;\">see spell</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 57.1848%;\">Entangled while casting</td>\n<td style=\"width: 42.0821%;\">15 + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

A ganzi may also pay 2 Prestige Points between adventures to replace their oddity with another legal oddity \" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbolN.gif\" />&nbsp;Expanded Oddities</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Plane-Hopper's Handbook pg. 18</em><br />Due to the Maelstrom&rsquo;s entropic influence on their compositions, ganzis each have an unusual but defining feature&mdash;referred to as an oddity&mdash;that sets them apart from other races and even from other members of their own race. These oddities vary wildly from ganzi to ganzi, and they can manifest as physical features, such as feathers, scales, or a tail, or as more subtle magical abilities. At the GM&rsquo;s discretion, players with ganzi characters can roll 1d20 to randomly determine what form their characters&rsquo; oddities take using the list below.<br />&emsp;<strong>1&ndash;3: Amorphous Limbs (Su)</strong>: The influence of the Maelstrom manifests in the ganzi&rsquo;s ability to transform one of her limbs at will, often into a natural weapon such as a massive clawed arm. Every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, a ganzi can transform one of her limbs into a natural melee weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. The transformation lasts until the beginning of the ganzi&rsquo;s next turn. The damage dealt by this natural weapon can be lethal or nonlethal, at the ganzi&rsquo;s discretion, and she chooses whether the damage type is bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.<br />&emsp;<strong>4&ndash;6: Ink (Ex)</strong>: As a standard action, the ganzi can spit a stream of opaque, black ink from her mouth to a distance of up to 20 feet. The ganzi can target either a creature or a square on the ground, each with different effects, as detailed below. The ganzi can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 4 Hit Dice she has.<br />&emsp;&nbsp;<em>Creature</em>: The ganzi shoots a stream of ink into a creature&rsquo;s eyes as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet. If the ganzi hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the ganzi&rsquo;s Hit Dice + the ganzi&rsquo;s Constitution modifier) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.<br />&emsp;&nbsp;<em>Ground</em>: The ganzi spits the ink into a single square on the ground within 30 feet, which becomes slippery for 1d6 rounds. Any creatures entering the square must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + half the ganzi&rsquo;s Hit Dice + the ganzi&rsquo;s Constitution modifier) or fall prone.<br />&emsp;<strong>7&ndash;10: Racing Mind (Ex)</strong>: A ganzi whose lineage is linked to hunduns might inherit an aspect of the outsiders&rsquo; chaotic minds. The ganzi&rsquo;s churning vortex of thoughts bolsters it against mental attacks, granting the ganzi a +2 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting effects.<br />&emsp;<strong>11&ndash;13: Spell-Like Ability (Sp)</strong>: Ganzis whose chaotic influences rise from sources other than the Maelstrom or its inhabitants often manifest an oddity that duplicates the effects of a specific spell. Such a ganzi gains one of the following spell-like abilities, which can be used once per day with a caster level equal to the ganzi&rsquo;s HD:&nbsp;<em>acid arrow</em>,&nbsp;<em>gust of wind</em>,&nbsp;<em>mirror image</em>,&nbsp;<em>resist energy</em>,&nbsp;<em>scorching ray</em>,&nbsp;<em>see invisibility</em>, or&nbsp;<em>warp wood</em>.<br />&emsp;<strong>14&ndash;16: Uncanny Aura (Su)</strong>: Some ganzis have an unsettling aura of chaos that rattles hostile creatures that venture too close. Once per day as a standard action, such a ganzi can activate an uncanny aura; enemies within 30 feet must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the ganzi&rsquo;s Hit Dice + the ganzi&rsquo;s Charisma modifier) or become frightened until the beginning of the ganzi&rsquo;s next turn. The aura remains for a number of rounds equal to the ganzi&rsquo;s Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). Once a creature has been affected by an uncanny aura, whether it failed its save or not, it cannot be affected again for 24 hours.<br />&emsp;<strong>17&ndash;18: Vestigial Wings (Ex)</strong>: The ganzi has a pair of small, vestigial wings, likely but not limited to resembling those of a flying creature or some manner of construct. Though these appendages do not grant flight, these ganzis can use their wings to stabilize themselves when they&rsquo;re thrown off balance. Such ganzis gain a +1 bonus on Reflex saving throws and a +2 bonus on Acrobatics checks to balance.<br />&emsp;<strong>19&ndash;20: Void Touch (Su)</strong>: A ganzi whose lineage is influenced strongly by voidworms might exhibit the ability to inflict chaos on others&rsquo; minds. Three times per day when such a ganzi hits a creature with a melee attack, the ganzi can deliver a burst of chaos to that creature as a free action. The target must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + half the ganzi&rsquo;s Hit Dice + the ganzi&rsquo;s Constitution modifier) or be confused for 1 round.</p>"}

At the pinnacle of this spire is the Boneyard, a necropolis of graveyards, mausoleums, and solemn courts dedicated to Pharasma, goddess of death. This gloomy realm, also known as Purgatory, is home to countless souls awaiting final judgment. Clad in the sheaths of their astral forms, these somber sojourners bask in deep reverie, reliving scenes from their mortal lives during a solitary, inward journey of remembrance and catharsis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This process, sometimes known as the &ldquo;kama-loka,&rdquo; allows the soul to revisit key scenes from its mortal life and evaluate the lessons of its previous incarnation on the Material Plane. Only when it has worked through the psychological troubles of its past can it proceed further along the River of Souls. As a soul reflects upon and settles its past affairs, it lets go of its ties to these events and begins to forget them, cleansing its soul for the glorious (or terrible) transformations to come. This is why petitioners in the Outer Sphere seldom remember much of their mortal existence, and why most mortals cannot remember anything of their past incarnations on the Material Plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ancient wisdom sometimes analogizes the soul&rsquo;s final moments as gazing into the Lake of Mortal Reflections, and seeing the whole of one&rsquo;s existence flash before one&rsquo;s eyes. The lessons of the manasaputras who guide the occult development of mortals suggest that the greatest esoteric fate is not to simply glance at the lake, but to step fully into its waters and allow them to subsume you. A soul immersed fully in the waters of the Lake of Mortal Reflections sheds the karma and experiences of its past life and, once again, the cleansed monadic soul descends into a new physical body in a cycle of reincarnation. With each subsequent reincarnation, the monad gains a greater appreciation for the experiences of a multitude of different incarnations, underlying the concept of the universal undersoul represented by the Cosmic Fire. With this understanding comes greater control over the soul&rsquo;s final incarnation as an outsider. According to esoteric lore, the most learned adepts are able to choose their own fates, becoming powerful outsiders, peerless mortal &ldquo;ascended masters,&rdquo; or even living gods.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The majority of souls do not reincarnate. When they finish the kama-loka process, their astral forms stand ready for final judgment. For some souls, the kama-loka progresses rapidly, while for others it can take years, decades, or even longer. Within Pharasma&rsquo;s courts, the native psychopomps work in concert with ambassadors from the realms of the Outer Sphere to guide souls to the final resting place that best matches their religious beliefs and ethos. In the unlikely event of deathbed conversions, renouncements of faith, or disputed soul-binding pacts, advocates for the souls&rsquo; potential fates argue with one another. The most significant disputes are seen to by Pharasma herself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Planar Traits</h2>\n<p>The Boneyard has the following traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeless:</strong> Age, hunger, thirst, afflictions (such as diseases, curses, and poisons), and natural healing don&rsquo;t function in the Boneyard, though they resume functioning when the traveler leaves the Boneyard.</p>\n<p><strong>Divinely Morphic</strong>: Deities with domains in the Boneyard can alter the plane at will.</p>\n<p><strong>Strongly Neutral-Aligned</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the death descriptor, or from the Death or Repose domains, are enhanced.</p>"}

However, unless an awaken spell is used, the animal doesn&rsquo;t automatically and instantly learn a language, any more than a human child does. The animal must be taught a language, usually over the course of months, giving it the understanding of the meaning of words and sentences beyond its trained responses to commands like &ldquo;attack&rdquo; and &ldquo;heel.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Even if the animal is taught to understand a language, it probably lacks the anatomy to actually speak (unless awaken is used). For example, dogs, elephants, and even gorillas lack the proper physiology to speak humanoid languages, though they can use their limited &ldquo;vocabulary&rdquo; of sounds to articulate concepts, especially if working with a person who learns what the sounds mean.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An intelligent animal is smart enough to use tools, but might lack the ability to manipulate them. A crow could be able to use simple lockpicks, but a dog can&rsquo;t. Even if the animal is physically capable of using a tool, it might still prefer its own natural body to manufactured items, especially when it comes to weapons. An intelligent gorilla could hold or wield a sword, but its inclination is to make slam attacks. No amount of training (including weapon proficiency feats) is going to make it fully comfortable attacking in any other way.</p>\n<p>Even if an animal&rsquo;s Intelligence increases to 3 or higher, you must still use the Handle Animal skill to direct the animal, as it is a smart animal rather than a low-intelligence person (using awaken is an exception&mdash;an awakened animal takes orders like a person). The GM should take the animal&rsquo;s Intelligence into account when determining its response to commands or its behavior when it doesn&rsquo;t have specific instructions. For example, an intelligent wolf companion can pick the weakest-looking target if directed to do so, and that same wolf trapped in a burning building might push open a door or window without being told.</p>"}

For example, a dagger (with a range of 10 feet) thrown at a target that is 25 feet away would incur a &ndash;4 penalty. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot to 10 range increments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weight</h2>\n<p>This column gives the weight of a Medium version of the weapon.

Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon causes two types of damage, the type it deals is not half one type and half another; all damage caused is of both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage caused by such a weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation where the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Special</h2>\n<p>Some weapons have special features in addition to those noted in their descriptions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Brace</h2>\n<p>If you use a readied action to set a brace weapon against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging character (see Chapter 8).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Disarm</h2>\n<p>When you use a disarm weapon, you get a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver Checks to disarm an enemy.</p>\n<p>See @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.2e9cYCdNMg0E9nDP]{2.07.3.03. Disarm}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Double</h2>\n<p>You can use a double weapon to fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You can choose to wield one end of a double weapon two-handed, but it cannot be used as a double weapon when wielded in this way&mdash;only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Monk</h2>\n<p>A monk weapon can be used by a monk to perform a flurry of blows (see Chapter 3).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nonlethal</h2>\n<p>These weapons deal nonlethal damage (see @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.Hzi8GbT19bP7mdSP]{2.03.8. Nonlethal Damage}).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Reach</h2>\n<p>You use a reach weapon to strike opponents 10 feet away, but you can&rsquo;t use it against an adjacent foe.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Trip</h2>\n<p>You can use a trip weapon to make trip attacks. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped.</p>\n<p>See @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.QBZtZChctrkE8ksB]{2.07.3.10. Trip}</p>"}

Known as blight quartz (although the crystals are not a form of traditional elemental material), these crystals appear as black or smoky gray gemstones that periodically shimmer or crackle with eerie, dark purple energy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The majority of blight quartz deposits are no larger than the size of a human fist. The process of crystallization diffuses the negative energy inherent in the material somewhat, but in large quantities the stuff can be debilitating. As long as a creature carries a pound or more of blight quartz or is within 5 feet of a deposit of blight quartz of a minimum of 10 pounds, that creature incurs 1 negative level. This negative level remains as long as the proximity to blight quartz continues, and disappears when these conditions end. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but cannot be overcome in any way (including via restoration) while proximity to the quartz continues. This is a negative energy effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While blight quartz cannot be worked into armor, the material can be used to augment melee weapons, as well as arrowheads, spear tips, and similar ammunition. Doing so costs an additional 200 gp per piece of ammunition or an additional 2,500 gp for a weapon. A creature hit with a blight quartz weapon must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1 negative level. A negative level imparted by a blight quartz weapon or ammunition lasts for 1 minute before fading and never results in permanent level loss. Negative levels imparted by multiple hits reset the duration but do not otherwise stack, nor do they stack with any other negative levels the weapon may otherwise impart, or with any negative levels the creature struck may already have. This is a negative energy effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Blight quartz has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10, but the material decays rapidly when taken from the Negative Material Plane, taking 2d6 points of damage that bypasses its hardness each round until it crumbles away into nothingness.</p>"}

The caster must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15 + the caster level of the antimagic field or DC 23 if there is no caster level for the effect).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Arcane Spell Failure</h2>\n<p>When a spellcaster fails an arcane failure check by rolling a 5% (a roll of 01&ndash;05 on the spell failure roll) or lower, she has a chance of becoming afflicted with a spellblight. The failed spellcaster must succeed on a Will saving throw (DC 15 + the spell&rsquo;s level) or gain a spellblight. A failed spell of 4th level or lower results in a minor spellblight, while a failed spell of 5th level or higher results in a major spellblight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crafting Magic Items</h2>\n<p>When a spellcaster is crafting a magic item, and fails the skill check to create the item, the GM can choose to give the caster a spellblight instead of having that check result in a cursed item. Determine the spellblight randomly based on the caster level of the item she was attempting to create. Creating an item with a caster level of 10 or lower gives a random minor spellblight, while creating an item of caster level 11 or higher gives a random major spellblight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Turning</h2>\n<p>When a spellcaster is warded with a spell turning, and so is the creature he or she attacks, such occurrences usually create a resonance field as described in the spell&rsquo;s description. Instead, the spellcaster who cast the original effect can choose not to create the resonance field and both spellcasters are affected by a major spellblight. The spell that triggered the resonance field drains away without effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Teleportation Mishap</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster who casts a teleportation spell that results in a teleportation mishap has a chance of gaining a spellblight. The spellcaster who cast the teleportation spell must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15 + the spell level of the teleport) or gain a major spellblight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Use Magic Device</h2>\n<p>When a spellcaster rolls a natural 1 while attempting to use a magic device with the Use Magic Device skill, she can choose to risk gaining a minor spellblight instead of not being able to activate the item for 24 hours (Will negates DC 10 + item&rsquo;s caster level).</p>"}

Such weapons only score a critical hit on a natural 20 and only deal &times;2 damage on a confirmed critical hit.</p>\n<p>If the item is a suit of armor or a shield, the bonus it grants to AC is halved, rounding down. Broken armor doubles its armor check penalty on skills.</p>\n<p>If the item is a tool needed for a skill, any skill check made with the item takes a &ndash;2 penalty.</p>\n<p>If the item is a wand or staff, it uses up twice as many charges when used.</p>\n<p>If the item does not fit into any of these categories, the broken condition has no effect on its use. Items with the broken condition, regardless of type, are worth 75% of their normal value. If the item is magical, it can only be repaired with a mending or make whole spell cast by a character with a caster level equal to or higher than the item&rsquo;s. Items lose the broken condition if the spell restores the object to half its original hit points or higher. Non-magical items can be repaired in a similar fashion, or through the Craft skill used to create it. Generally speaking, this requires a DC 20 Craft check and 1 hour of work per point of damage to be repaired. Most craftsmen charge one-tenth the item&rsquo;s total cost to repair such damage (more if the item is badly damaged or ruined).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Confused</h2>\n<p>A confused creature is mentally befuddled and cannot act normally. A confused creature cannot tell the difference between ally and foe, treating all creatures as enemies. Allies wishing to cast a beneficial spell that requires a touch on a confused creature must succeed on a melee touch attack. If a confused creature is attacked, it attacks the creature that last attacked it until that creature is dead or out of sight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Roll on the following table at the beginning of each confused subject&rsquo;s turn each round to see what the subject does in that round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 97.6056%; height: 80px;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.27875%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">d%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89.9997%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Behavior</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.27875%; height: 16px;\">01-25</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89.9997%; height: 16px;\">Act normally.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.27875%; height: 16px;\">26-50</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89.9997%; height: 16px;\">Do nothing but babble incoherently.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.27875%; height: 16px;\">51-75</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89.9997%; height: 16px;\">Deal 1d8 points of damage + Str modifier to self with item in hand.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 9.27875%; height: 16px;\">76-100</td>\n<td style=\"width: 89.9997%; height: 16px;\">Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, a familiar counts as part of the subject's self).</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A confused creature who can&rsquo;t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused creature. Any confused creature who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes. Note that a confused creature will not make attacks of opportunity against anything that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cowering</h2>\n<p>The character is frozen in fear and can take no actions. A cowering character takes a &ndash;2 penalty to Armor Class and loses his Dexterity bonus (if any).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dazed</h2>\n<p>The creature is unable to act normally. A dazed creature can take no actions, but has no penalty to AC. A dazed condition typically lasts 1 round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dazzled</h2>\n<p>The creature is unable to see well because of overstimulation of the eyes. A dazzled creature takes a &ndash;1 penalty on attack rolls and sight-based Perception checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dead</h2>\n<p>The character&rsquo;s hit points are reduced to a negative amount equal to his Constitution score, his Constitution drops to 0, or he is killed outright by a spell or effect. The character&rsquo;s soul leaves his body. Dead characters cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be restored to life via magic. A dead body decays normally unless magically preserved, but magic that restores a dead character to life also restores the body either to full health or to its condition at the time of death (depending on the spell or device). Either way, resurrected characters need not worry about rigor mortis, decomposition, and other conditions that affect dead bodies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Deafened</h2>\n<p>A deafened character cannot hear. He takes a &ndash;4 penalty on initiative checks, automatically fails Perception checks based on sound, takes a &ndash;4 penalty on opposed Perception checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components. Characters who remain deafened for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Disabled</h2>\n<p>A character with 0 hit points, or one who has negative hit points but has become stable and conscious, is disabled. A disabled character may take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can he take full-round actions, but he can still take swift, immediate, and free actions). He moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesn&rsquo;t risk further injury, but performing any standard action (or any other action the GM deems strenuous, including some free actions such as casting a quickened spell) deals 1 point of damage after the completion of the act. Unless the action increased the disabled character&rsquo;s hit points, he is now in negative hit points and dying.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A disabled character with negative hit points recovers hit points naturally if he is being helped. Otherwise, each day he can attempt a DC 10 Constitution check after resting for 8 hours, to begin recovering hit points naturally. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Failing this check causes the character to lose 1 hit point, but this does not cause the character to become unconscious. Once a character makes this check, he continues to heal naturally and is no longer in danger of losing hit points naturally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dying</h2>\n<p>A dying creature is unconscious and near death. Creatures that have negative hit points and have not stabilized are dying. A dying creature can take no actions. On the character&rsquo;s next turn, after being reduced to negative hit points (but not dead), and on all subsequent turns, the character must make a DC 10 Constitution check to become stable. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. A character that is stable does not need to make this check. A natural 20 on this check is an automatic success. If the character fails this check, he loses 1 hit point. If a dying creature has an amount of negative hit points equal to its Constitution score, it dies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Energy Drained</h2>\n<p>The character gains one or more negative levels, which might become permanent. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, he dies. See Energy Drain and Negative levels more information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Entangled</h2>\n<p>The character is ensnared. Being entangled impedes movement, but does not entirely prevent it unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force. An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a &ndash;2 penalty on all attack rolls and a &ndash;4 penalty to Dexterity. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) or lose the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Exhausted</h2>\n<p>An exhausted character moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a &ndash;6 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes fatigued. A fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fascinated</h2>\n<p>A fascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or spell effect. The creature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effect, for as long as the effect lasts. It takes a &ndash;4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Perception checks. Any potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated creature a new saving throw against the fascinating effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect. A fascinated creature&rsquo;s ally may shake it free of the spell as a standard action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fatigued</h2>\n<p>A fatigued character can neither run nor charge and takes a &ndash;2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity. Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become exhausted. After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Flat-Footed</h2>\n<p>A character who has not yet acted during a combat is flat-footed, unable to react normally to the situation. A flat-footed character loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) and cannot make attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Frightened</h2>\n<p>A frightened creature flees from the source of its fear as best it can. If unable to flee, it may fight. A frightened creature takes a &ndash;2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to f lee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Frightened is like shaken, except that the creature must flee if possible. Panicked is a more extreme state of fear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Grappled</h2>\n<p>A grappled creature is restrained by a creature, trap, or effect. Grappled creatures cannot move and take a &ndash;4 penalty to Dexterity. A grappled creature takes a &ndash;2 penalty on all attack rolls and combat maneuver checks, except those made to grapple or escape a grapple. In addition, grappled creatures can take no action that requires two hands to perform. A grappled character who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a concentration check (DC 10 + grappler&rsquo;s CMB + spell level, see Concentration), or lose the spell. Grappled creatures cannot make attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A grappled creature cannot use Stealth to hide from the creature grappling it, even if a special ability, such as hide in plain sight, would normally allow it to do so. If a grappled creature becomes invisible, through a spell or other ability, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus on its CMD to avoid being grappled, but receives no other benefit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Helpless</h2>\n<p>A helpless character is paralyzed, held, bound, sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise completely at an opponent&rsquo;s mercy. A helpless target is treated as having a Dexterity of 0 (&ndash;5 modifier). Melee attacks against a helpless target get a +4 bonus (equivalent to attacking a prone target). Ranged attacks get no special bonus against helpless targets. Rogues can sneak attack helpless targets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a full-round action, an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe. An enemy can also use a bow or crossbow, provided he is adjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and scores a critical hit. (A rogue also gets his sneak attack damage bonus against a helpless foe when delivering a coup de grace.) If the defender survives, he must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Creatures that are immune to critical hits do not take critical damage, nor do they need to make Fortitude saves to avoid being killed by a coup de grace.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Incorporeal</h2>\n<p>Creatures with the incorporeal condition do not have a physical body. Incorporeal creatures are immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Incorporeal creatures take half damage (50%) from magic weapons, spells, spell-like effects, and supernatural effects. Incorporeal creatures take full damage from other incorporeal creatures and effects, as well as all force effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Invisible</h2>\n<p>Invisible creatures are visually undetectable. An invisible creature gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against a sighted opponent, and ignores its opponent&rsquo;s Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). See Invisibility, under Special Abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nauseated</h2>\n<p>Creatures with the nauseated condition experience stomach distress. Nauseated creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. The only action such a character can take is a single move actions per turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Panicked</h2>\n<p>A panicked creature must drop anything it holds and f lee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path. It can&rsquo;t take any other actions. In addition, the creature takes a &ndash;2 penalty on all saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If cornered, a panicked creature cowers and does not attack, typically using the total defense action in combat. A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to f lee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Panicked is a more extreme state of fear than shaken or frightened.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Paralyzed</h2>\n<p>A paralyzed character is frozen in place and unable to move or act. A paralyzed character has effective Dexterity and Strength scores of 0 and is helpless, but can take purely mental actions. A winged creature f lying in the air at the time that it becomes paralyzed cannot f lap its wings and falls. A paralyzed swimmer can&rsquo;t swim and may drown. A creature can move through a space occupied by a paralyzed creature&mdash;ally or not. Each square occupied by a paralyzed creature, however, counts as 2 squares to move through.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Petrified</h2>\n<p>A petrified character has been turned to stone and is considered unconscious. If a petrified character cracks or breaks, but the broken pieces are joined with the body as he returns to flesh, he is unharmed. If the character&rsquo;s petrified body is incomplete when it returns to flesh, the body is likewise incomplete and there is some amount of permanent hit point loss and/or debilitation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pinned</h2>\n<p>A pinned creature is tightly bound and can take few actions. A pinned creature cannot move and is denied its Dexterity bonus. A pinned character also takes an additional &ndash;4 penalty to his Armor Class. A pinned creature is limited in the actions that it can take. A pinned creature can always attempt to free itself, usually through a combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. A pinned creature can take verbal and mental actions, but cannot cast any spells that require a somatic or material component. A pinned character who attempts to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability must make a concentration check (DC 10 + grappler&rsquo;s CMB + spell level) or lose the spell. Pinned is a more severe version of grappled, and their effects do not stack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Prone</h2>\n<p>The character is lying on the ground. A prone attacker has a &ndash;4 penalty on melee attack rolls and cannot use a ranged weapon (except for a crossbow). A prone defender gains a +4 bonus to Armor Class against ranged attacks, but takes a &ndash;4 penalty to AC against melee attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Standing up is a move-equivalent action that provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shaken</h2>\n<p>A shaken character takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. Shaken is a less severe state of fear than frightened or panicked.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sickened</h2>\n<p>The character takes a &ndash;2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stable</h2>\n<p>A character who was dying but who has stopped losing hit points each round and still has negative hit points is stable. The character is no longer dying, but is still unconscious. If the character has become stable because of aid from another character (such as a Heal check or magical healing), then the character no longer loses hit points. The character can make a DC 10 Constitution check each hour to become conscious and disabled (even though his hit points are still negative). The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a character has become stable on his own and hasn&rsquo;t had help, he is still at risk of losing hit points. Each hour he can make a Constitution check to become stable (as a character that has received aid), but each failed check causes him to lose 1 hit point.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Staggered</h2>\n<p>A staggered creature may take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can he take full-round actions). A staggered creature can still take free, swift, and immediate actions. A creature with nonlethal damage exactly equal to its current hit points gains the staggered condition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stunned</h2>\n<p>A stunned creature drops everything held, can&rsquo;t take actions, takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC, and loses its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Unconscious</h2>\n<p>Unconscious creatures are knocked out and helpless. Unconsciousness can result from having negative hit points (but not more than the creature&rsquo;s Constitution score), or from nonlethal damage in excess of current hit points.</p>"}

Cobblestones in good condition allow normal movement, but roads in poor repair and heavily rutted dirt streets are considered light rubble, increasing the DC of Acrobatics checks by 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some cities have no larger thoroughfares, particularly cities that gradually grew from small settlements to larger cities. Cities that are planned, or perhaps have suffered a major fire that allowed authorities to construct new roads through formerly inhabited areas, might have a few larger streets through town. These main roads are 25 feet wide&mdash;offering room for wagons to pass each other&mdash;with 5-foot-wide sidewalks on either side.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crowds</h2>\n<p>Urban streets are often full of people going about their daily lives. In most cases, it isn&rsquo;t necessary to put every 1st-level commoner on the map when a fight breaks out on the city&rsquo;s main thoroughfare. Instead, just indicate which squares on the map contain crowds. If crowds see something obviously dangerous, they&rsquo;ll move away at 30 feet per round at initiative count 0. It takes 2 squares of movement to enter a square with crowds. The crowds provide cover for anyone who does so, enabling a Stealth check and providing a bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Directing Crowds</h2>\n<p>It takes a DC 15 Diplomacy check or DC 20 Intimidate check to convince a crowd to move in a particular direction, and the crowd must be able to hear or see the character making the attempt. It takes a full-round action to make the Diplomacy check, but only a free action to make the Intimidate check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If two or more characters are trying to direct a crowd in different directions, they make opposed Diplomacy or Intimidate checks to determine to whom the crowd listens. The crowd ignores everyone if none of the characters&rsquo; check results beat the DCs given above.</p>"}

A character who moves his speed and takes some action is hustling for about half the round and doing something else the other half.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hampered Movement</h2>\n<p>Difficult terrain, obstacles, and poor visibility can hamper movement (see Table 7&ndash;7 for details). When movement is hampered, each square moved into usually counts as two squares, effectively reducing the distance that a character can cover in a move. If more than one hampering condition applies, multiply all additional costs that apply. This is a specific exception to the normal rule for doubling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In some situations, your movement may be so hampered that you don&rsquo;t have sufficient speed even to move 5 feet (1 square). In such a case, you may use a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. Even though this looks like a 5-foot step, it&rsquo;s not, and thus it provokes attacks of opportunity normally. (You can&rsquo;t take advantage of this rule to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited to you.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t run or charge through any square that would hamper your movement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 7-7: Hampered Movement</h2>\n<table style=\"height: 80px; width: 45.4415%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.5116%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Condition</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.8244%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Additional Movement Cost</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.5116%; height: 16px;\">Difficult Terrain</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.8244%; height: 16px;\">&times;2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.5116%; height: 16px;\">Obstacle*</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.8244%; height: 16px;\">&times;2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.5116%; height: 16px;\">Poor Visibility</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.8244%; height: 16px;\">&times;2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.5116%; height: 16px;\">Impassable</td>\n<td style=\"width: 50.8244%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>* May require a skill check</p>"}

Each word represents a new source of power that falls under the wordcaster&rsquo;s control. Words of power fall into three categories: target words, effect words, and meta words. Wordcasters arrange these words of power to cast powerful and diverse incantations known as wordspells. It should come as no surprise that most wordcasters obsessively learn as many words of power as their minds can comprehend.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regardless of class, each wordcaster begins play knowing all of the target words&mdash;even those that they cannot yet use due to the level restriction&mdash;as well as the boost meta word. These words are learned as part of their most basic training. For arcane casters using a spellbook, formula book, or familiar, these words do not have a cost to scribe and take up one page each.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the basic allotment, each wordcaster also begins play knowing a number of effect and meta words equal to the number of spells they would normally be allowed to know at 1st level, and gain additional words at the normal rate. Wordcasters select effect words from the word lists associated with their class, found on pages 189&ndash;193. For each class, use the following guidelines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alchemist</h2>\n<p>An alchemist begins play knowing a number of 1st-level effect or meta words equal to 2 + the alchemist&rsquo;s Intelligence modifier. Whenever he gains another level of alchemist, he adds one new effect or meta word to his formula book. He may learn new words as normal, adding them to his formula book for the same time and cost as it would take to add a spell of the same level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bard, Inquisitors, Oracles, Sorcerers, and Summoners</h2>\n<p>These spellcasters begin play knowing a number of effect or meta words equal to the number indicated on their respective Spells Known tables. Whenever they gain a level in their respective classes or a level of spellcasting in those classes, they gain new effect or meta words based on the same table. They may exchange words for other words, using the same rules they use for exchanging spells, except that they may not exchange target words.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Clerics, Druids, Rangers, and Paladins</h2>\n<p>These casters know all of the effect and meta words of power assigned to their respective classes and may arrange wordspells using any words that their spell slots can use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magi, Witches, and Wizards</h2>\n<p>Magi, witches, and wizards begin play knowing all 0-level effect and meta words for their respective classes and a number of 1st-level effect or meta words equal to 3 + their Intelligence modifier. Whenever witches, wizards, or magi gain another level in their respective classes, they add 2 additional words to their spellbook or familiar, of any level they can cast. They can add new effect or meta words to their spellbooks or familiars for the same time and cost as it would take to add a spell of the same level.</p>"}

Miscellaneous Trap Features}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 418</em></p>\n<p>The effect of a trap is what happens to those who spring it. This often takes the form of either damage or a spell effect, but some traps have special effects. A trap usually either makes an attack roll or forces a saving throw to avoid it. Occasionally a trap uses both of these options, or neither (see Never Miss).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pits</h2>\n<p>These are holes (covered or not) that characters can fall into, causing them to take damage. A pit needs no attack roll, but a successful Reflex save (DC set by the builder) avoids it. Other save-dependent mechanical traps also fall into this category. Falling into a pit deals 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of depth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pits in dungeons come in three basic varieties: uncovered, covered, and chasms. Pits and chasms can be defeated by judicious application of the Acrobatics skill, the Climb skill, or various mechanical or magical means.</p>\n<p>Uncovered pits and natural chasms serve mainly to discourage intruders from going a certain way, although they cause much grief to characters who stumble into them in the dark, and they can greatly complicate nearby melee.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Covered pits are much more dangerous. They can be detected with a DC 20 Perception check, but only if the character is taking the time to carefully examine the area before walking across it. A character who fails to detect a covered pit is still entitled to a DC 20 Reflex save to avoid falling into it. If she was running or moving recklessly at the time, however, she gets no saving throw and falls automatically.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trap coverings can be as simple as piled refuse (straw, leaves, sticks, garbage), a large rug, or an actual trap door concealed to appear as a normal part of the floor. Such a trap door usually swings open when enough weight (usually about 50 to 80 pounds) is placed upon it. Devious trap builders sometimes design trap doors so they spring back shut after they open. The trap door might lock once it&rsquo;s back in place, leaving the stranded character well and truly trapped. Opening such a trap door is just as difficult as opening a regular door (assuming the trapped character can reach it), and a DC 13 Strength check is needed to keep a spring-loaded door open.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pit traps often have something nastier than just a hard floor at the bottom. A trap designer might put spikes, monsters, or a pool of acid, lava, or even water at the bottom. For rules on pit spikes and other such add-ons, see the Miscellaneous Trap Features section.</p>\n<p>Monsters sometimes live in pits. Any monster that can fit into the pit might have been placed there by the dungeon&rsquo;s designer, or might simply have fallen in and not been able to climb back out.</p>\n<p>A secondary trap, mechanical or magical, at the bottom of a pit can be particularly deadly. Activated by a falling victim, the secondary trap attacks the already injured character when she&rsquo;s least ready for it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ranged Attack Traps</h2>\n<p>These traps f ling darts, arrows, spears, or the like at whomever activated the trap. The builder sets the attack bonus. A ranged attack trap can be configured to simulate the effect of a composite bow with a high Strength rating, which provides the trap with a bonus on damage equal to its Strength rating. These traps deal whatever damage their ammunition normally does. If a trap is constructed with a high Strength rating, it has a corresponding bonus on damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Melee Attack Traps</h2>\n<p>These traps feature such obstacles as sharp blades that emerge from walls and stone blocks that fall from ceilings. Once again, the builder sets the attack bonus. These traps deal the same damage as the melee weapons they &ldquo;wield.&rdquo; In the case of a falling stone block, you can assign any amount of bludgeoning damage you like, but remember that whoever resets the trap has to lift that stone back into place.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A melee attack trap can be constructed with a built-in bonus on damage rolls, just as if the trap itself had a high Strength score.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Traps</h2>\n<p>Spell traps produce the spell&rsquo;s effect. Like all spells, a spell trap that allows a saving throw has a save DC of 10 + spell level + caster&rsquo;s relevant ability modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Device Traps</h2>\n<p>These traps produce the effects of any spells included in their construction, as described in the appropriate entries. If the spell in a magic device trap allows a saving throw, its save DC is (10 + spell level) &times; 1.5. Some spells make attack rolls instead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Special</h2>\n<p>Some traps have miscellaneous features that produce special effects, such as drowning for a water trap or ability damage for poison. Saving throws and damage depend on the poison or are set by the builder, as appropriate.</p>"}

Benefits of Harmful Conditions}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 96</em></p>\n<p>The following list details some of the most common major spellblights.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Eldritch Cataracts</h2>\n<p>Each time a spellcaster with this spellblight casts a spell, her vision becomes fuzzier and fuzzier until eventually she is blinded. Each time the spellcaster casts a spell, she must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 15 + the spell&rsquo;s level. If she fails, she takes a &ndash;1 penalty on vision-based Perception checks until the spellblight is removed. Further failed saving throws increase the penalty by 1 until the character reaches a &ndash;4 penalty, at which point she becomes blinded instead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eldritch cataracts is a difficult spellblight to cure. Any effect that cures blindness reduces the penalty by 1. If the penalty is reduced to &ndash;3 or lower, any blindness is relieved until the caster fails the Fortitude saving throw enough times to bring the penalty back to &ndash;4. Reducing the penalty to 0 cures the spellblight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Blind creatures and creatures that don&rsquo;t use sight are immune to eldritch cataracts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nameless Dread</h2>\n<p>Acaster with nameless dread believes strange beings from far dimensions or the blackness between the stars are hounding her and sapping her sanity. Every time the caster uses a spell or a spell-like ability, she sees a glimpse of her nameless pursuers. She must succeed at a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell&rsquo;s level), or become shaken for 1 round per level of the spell. If already shaken, the spellcaster becomes frightened for the duration of the original effect or the duration of the new effect, whichever is greater. If she is already frightened, she becomes panicked (and cannot cast) for the duration of the current effect or the duration of the new effect, whichever is greater. Each time a spellcaster becomes panicked, there is a 5% chance she will become permanently insane (as the insanity spell, or the GM may choose a form of insanity listed on pages 250&ndash;251 of the GameMastery Guide).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A spellcaster suffering from nameless dread is particularly adept at wielding spells with the fear or chaos descriptor. When she casts a spell with that descriptor, the save DC for that spell is increased by 1, and she gains a +1 competence bonus on all caster level checks made to bypass spell resistance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spells that suppress fear work on nameless dread. Those that remove fear effects suppress the effects of nameless dread (and its benefits to spellcasting) for 1 hour.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Negated</h2>\n<p>A negated spellcaster has his ability to manipulate magical energies disrupted. He gains spell resistance equal to 10 plus twice the highest spell level he can cast. This spell resistance cannot be voluntarily lowered. In addition, anytime he casts a spell, he must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against this spell resistance. On a successful check, the spell is completed and the spellcaster&rsquo;s spell resistance is removed until the start of his next turn. Failure indicates he failed to muster up enough magical energy to cast the spell, but the spell is not lost and may be attempted again. Any feats or abilities that aid in bypassing spell resistance help with this check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Restoration suppresses the negated spellblight for one day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Obsessive Fixation</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster with an obsessive fixation develops a tendency toward repetition. This manifests itself differently depending on whether the spellcaster prepares spells, is a spontaneous caster, or uses spell-like abilities. When preparing spells, an afflicted spellcaster must attempt to prepare as many duplicate spells as she can, meaning she prepares two copies of each spell she picks, but cannot exceed her normal number of spell slots to do so. This need to prepare multiples (thus limiting her versatility) is the only effect. If the spellcaster is a spontaneous caster or uses spell-like abilities, when that spellcaster casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she must cast that spell again on her next turn, or becomes dazed for 1 round at the end of her turn. Once she casts two copies of the same spell in a row or becomes dazed, the obsessive fixation resets, and she can cast any spell she knows, starting the cycle again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Obsessive fixation can be suppressed for 1 day with an effect that removes confusion or insanity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Phase Blight</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster afflicted with spellblight fades in and out of existence. Each time she casts a spell, she phases in and out of reality for 1 round per level of the spell cast. While phasing, any physical attacks made against the spellcaster have a 50% miss chance, any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail to affect the caster, and the spellcaster takes only half damage from area attacks. In addition, while actively phasing, all of a spellcaster&rsquo;s physical attacks have a 50% miss chance, all of the caster&rsquo;s spells that target creatures have a 50% chance of affecting the target, and all of the caster&rsquo;s area attacks do 50% of their normal damage. Unlike when casting the blink spell, the spellcaster does not become ethereal; she blinks in and out of reality altogether.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Effects that block planar travel, like dimensional anchor, stabilize a phasing creature for the duration of the effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Burn</h2>\n<p>Each time a spellcaster afflicted with this spellblight casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, her skin feels like it burns, as if she were on fire. With a successful concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell level cast), the spellcaster can ignore the pain of the effect, but if she fails, she is staggered for a round. While the caster is staggered by this spellblight, any spell with the fire descriptor that she casts has its saving throw DC increased by 1.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The burning sensation is a figment of the caster&rsquo;s imagination. Spellcasters that are immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to this spellblight, and don&rsquo;t gain the beneficial effect when casting spells with the fire descriptor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Sap</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster with spell sap is subject to blackouts when casting spells. She may become mentally locked, distant, or catatonic, or may even slip into unconsciousness. Each time the afflicted spellcaster casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, she must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 14 + caster level) or become dazed until the end of her next turn. If she fails the save by 10 or more, she instead falls prone and lapses into unconsciousness for 1d4 rounds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spell sap can be suppressed for 1 day with an effect that removes confusion or insanity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Transference Block</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster with transference block has difficulty targeting allies with spell effects. Anytime she casts a spell on an ally, she must make a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the spell&rsquo;s level) or the spell is lost.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Transference block can be cured by spending 1 hour in an antimagic field.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vertigo</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster with vertigo becomes dizzy and lightheaded when she casts a spell. Each time she casts a spell or uses a spell-like ability, the world spins and shifts around her. She must succeed at a concentration check (with a DC equal to the 15 + twice the level of the spell being cast). If the spellcaster fails the check, she falls prone, and for 1d4 rounds takes a penalty on Acrobatics, Climb, Ride, Stealth, and Swim checks equal to 1 + the level of the spell. While the afflicted spellcaster takes those penalties, she must also succeed at a DC 10 Acrobatics check in order to stand up from prone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A restoration cast on the afflicted spellcaster suppresses this spellblight for 1 day.</p>"}

Siege Engine Details}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 166</em></p>\n<p>While armies can use siege weapons against troops, usually the goal of a siege engine is to demoralize foes and pound their structures to rubble. The following rules give the statistics for various buildings and barriers that are often the targets of siege engine attacks. They are split up into three different categories: buildings, gates, and walls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When any of these structures gain the broken condition, their hardness is halved, along with any other effects of the broken condition.</p>\n<h2>Buildings</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 167</em></p>\n<p>Buildings are sizable structures with many hit points and very poor ACs (a Large building is AC 4, a Huge building is AC 3, and a Gargantuan or larger building is AC 0). When a building is reduced to half its hit points, it is broken&mdash;it still stands, but only partially. It can be easily entered, and for all intents and purposes it has been breached. Reducing a building to 0 hit points completely destroys that building. Creatures inside the building suffer the effects of a cave-in.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All these building statistics assume that the structure&rsquo;s inside is somewhat hollow but sturdily built, with enough space for its occupants to walk around inside. Flimsy buildings have half the hit points of the buildings detailed in Table 3&ndash;18. Buildings can be magically treated, like dungeon walls and doors can. Doing so doubles their hardness and hit points. Magically treating a building costs 5,000 gp for a Large building, 10,000 gp for a Huge building, 20,000 gp for a Gargantuan building, and 40,000 gp for a Colossal building. A spellcaster with the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat can magically treat buildings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For larger buildings, put together multiple buildings of these sizes and add the hit points together.</p>\n<h2>Table 3-18: Buildings</h2>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Hit Points</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Material</td>\n<td>Hardness</td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wood</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>120</td>\n<td>270</td>\n<td>960</td>\n<td>3,240</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stone</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>450</td>\n<td>1,600</td>\n<td>5,400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Iron or steel</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>900</td>\n<td>3,200</td>\n<td>10,800</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adamantine</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>560</td>\n<td>1,260</td>\n<td>4,480</td>\n<td>15,120</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Gates</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 167</em></p>\n<p>Gates serve as the entrances and exits to fortified structures, and are typically the weakest spots in any fortification&rsquo;s defenses. Gates are at least Large, but can be as large as Colossal. It typically takes three full-round actions to open or close a Large gate (up to three creatures can work together to close a Large gate as a full-round action), and larger gates typically take at least a minute to close or open. Gates have ACs based on their size (a Large gate is AC 4, a Huge gate is AC 3, and a Gargantuan or larger gate is AC 0).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gates can be magically treated. Doing so doubles the hardness and hit points. Magically treating a gate costs 2,000 gp for a Large gate, 4,000 gp for a Huge gate, 8,000 gp for a Gargantuan gate, and 16,000 gp for a Colossal gate. A spellcaster with the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat can magically treat gates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gates can be attacked and damaged, or they can become broken (as the condition) with a successful Strength check, usually as a result of ramming. When a gate gains the broken condition, it is effectively breached, and can be moved through as if it were an opening one size smaller.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 3-20: Gates</h2>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Hit Points</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Material</td>\n<td>Break DC1</td>\n<td>Hardness</td>\n<td>Large</td>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>Gargantuan</td>\n<td>Colossal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wood</td>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>135</td>\n<td>240</td>\n<td>540</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stone</td>\n<td>38</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>225</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>900</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Iron or steel</td>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>800</td>\n<td>1,800</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Adamantine</td>\n<td>40</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>280</td>\n<td>630</td>\n<td>1,120</td>\n<td>2,520</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>1: The DC assumes the gate is size Large and is barred and locked.

Magically treating wall squares costs 500 gp per wall square. A spellcaster with the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat can magically treat walls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When a wall gains the broken condition, its hardness is halved, but the wall is not breached. Only destroying a section of wall allows it to become breached. When a square of wall is breached, any sections directly above it fall onto the missing section of walls.

Firearm Description}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 135</em></p>\n<p>Firearms work differently from other ranged projectile weapons&mdash;they instead use the following rules.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Firearm Proficiency</h2>\n<p>The Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms) feat allows you to use all firearms without penalty. A nonproficient character takes the standard &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls with firearms, and a nonproficient character who loads a firearm increases all misfire values by 4 for the shots he loads.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even though the Exotic Weapon Proficiency (firearms) feat grants you proficiency with all firearms, anytime you take a feat that modifies a single type of weapon (such as Weapon Focus or Rapid Reload), you must still pick one specific type of firearm (such as musket, axe musket, blunderbuss, pistol, or double pistol) for that feat to affect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All firearms are part of the same weapon group for the purposes of the fighter's weapon training class feature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Capacity</h2>\n<p>A firearm's capacity is the number of shots it can hold at one time. When making a full-attack action, you may fire a firearm as many times in a round as you have attacks, up to this limit, unless you can reload the weapon as a swift or free action while making a full-attack action. In the case of early firearms, capacity often indicates the number of barrels a firearm has. In the case of advanced firearms, it typically indicates the number of chambers the weapon has.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Range and Penetration</h2>\n<p>Armor, whether manufactured or natural, provides little protection against the force of a bullet at short range.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Early Firearms</h2>\n<p>When firing an early firearm, the attack resolves against the target's touch AC when the target is within the first range increment of the weapon, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats and abilities such as Deadly Aim. At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative &ndash;2 penalty for each full range increment. Unlike other projectile weapons, early firearms have a maximum range of five range increments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Advanced Firearms</h2>\n<p>Advanced firearms resolve their attacks against touch AC when the target is within the first five range increments, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats such as Deadly Aim. At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative &ndash;2 penalty for each full-range increment. Advanced firearms have a maximum range of 10 range increments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Loading a Firearm</h2>\n<p>You need at least one hand free to load one-handed and two-handed firearms. In the case of two-handed firearms, you hold the weapon in one hand and load it with the other&mdash;you only need to hold it in two hands to aim and shoot the firearm. Loading siege firearms requires both hands, and one hand usually manipulates a large ramrod (which can be wielded as a club in combat).</p>\n<p>The Rapid Reload feat reduces the time required to load one-handed and two-handed firearms, but this feat does not reduce the time it takes to load siege firearms.</p>\n<p>Loading any firearm provokes attacks of opportunity. Other rules for loading a firearm depend on whether the firearm is an early firearm or an advanced firearm.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Early Firearms</h2>\n<p>Early firearms are muzzle-loaded, requiring bullets or pellets and black powder to be rammed down the muzzle. If an early firearm has multiple barrels, each barrel must be loaded separately. It is a standard action to load each barrel of a one-handed early firearm and a full-round action to load each barrel of a two-handed early firearm. It takes three full-round actions by one person to load a siege firearm. This can be reduced to two full-round actions if more than one person is loading the cannon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Advanced Firearms</h2>\n<p>Advanced firearms are chamber-loaded. It is a move action to load a one-handed or two-handed advanced firearm to its full capacity. The Rapid Reload feat reduces this to a free action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Misfires</h2>\n<p>If the natural result of your attack roll falls within a firearm's misfire value, that shot misses, even if you would have otherwise hit the target. When a firearm misfires, it gains the broken condition. While it has the broken condition, it suffers the normal disadvantages that broken weapons do, and its misfire value increases by 4 unless the wielder has gun training in the particular type of firearm (see the gunslinger class). In that case, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Early Firearms</h2>\n<p>If an early firearm with the broken condition misfires again, it explodes. When a nonmagical firearm explodes, the weapon is destroyed. Magical firearms are wrecked, which means they can't fire until they are fully restored (which requires either the make whole spell or the Gunsmithing feat). When a gun explodes, pick one corner of your square&mdash;the explosion creates a burst from that point of origin. Each firearm has a burst size noted in parentheses after its misfire value. Any creature within this burst (including the firearm's wielder) takes damage as if it had been hit by the weapon&mdash;a DC 12 Reflex save halves this damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Advanced Firearms</h2>\n<p>Advanced firearms can misfire, but when they do, they only gain the broken condition. A further misfire does not cause advanced firearms to explode.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ammunition</h2>\n<p>Firearm ammunition takes two forms: either black powder and shot (either bullets or pellets) or cartridges. Unlike other types of ammunition, firearm ammunition is destroyed when it is used, and has no chance of being retrieved on a miss. No part of a cartridge can be reused to create new cartridges. Firearm ammunition cannot be treated with poison, unless you are using a pitted bullet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Concealing Firearms</h2>\n<p>Like light weapons and hand crossbows, one-handed firearms are easy to conceal on your person. Some smaller firearms (like the coat pistol) can grant bonuses to conceal a weapon on your person.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Inappropriately Sized Firearms</h2>\n<p>You cannot make optimum use of a firearm that is not properly sized for you. A cumulative &ndash;2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between your size and the size of the firearm. If you are not proficient with the firearm, a &ndash;4 nonproficiency penalty also applies. The size of a firearm never affects how many hands you need to use to shoot it, the exception being siege firearms and Large or larger creatures. In most cases, a Large or larger creature can use a siege firearm as a two-handed firearm, but the creature takes a &ndash;4 penalty for using it this way because of its awkwardness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bucklers</h2>\n<p>You can use a one-handed or two-handed firearm without penalty while carrying a buckler.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fire while Prone</h2>\n<p>Firearms, like crossbows, can be fired while their wielders are prone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Firearms, Black Powder, and Water</h2>\n<p>Black powder becomes useless when exposed to water, but powder horns and cartridges protect black powder from exposure. You cannot normally load an early firearm underwater or fire any firearm underwater without magical aid.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Deflecting and Snatching Bullets</h2>\n<p>The Deflect Arrows feat and the Snatch Arrows feat can be used to deflect bullets, but not pellets shot from a scatter weapon. Neither of these feats can be used to deflect siege firearm attacks.</p>"}

Special Materials}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Source PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 149</p>\n<p>For most, armor is the simplest way to protect oneself in a world of rampant threats and dangers. Many characters can wear only the simplest of armors, and only some can use shields. To wear heavier armor effectively, a character can select the Armor Proficiency feats, but most classes are automatically proficient with the armors that work best for them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here is the format for armor entries (given as column headings on Table 6&ndash;6).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cost</h2>\n<p>The cost in gold pieces of the armor for Small or Medium humanoid creatures. See Table 6&ndash;8 for armor prices for other creatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Armor/Shield Bonus</h2>\n<p>Each type of armor grants an armor bonus to AC, while shields grant a shield bonus to AC. The armor bonus from a suit of armor doesn&rsquo;t stack with other effects or items that grant an armor bonus. Similarly, the shield bonus from a shield doesn&rsquo;t stack with other effects that grant a shield bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Maximum Dex Bonus</h2>\n<p>This number is the maximum Dexterity bonus to AC that this type of armor allows. Dexterity bonuses in excess of this number are reduced to this number for the purposes of determining the wearer&rsquo;s AC. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing the wearer&rsquo;s ability to dodge blows. This restriction doesn&rsquo;t affect any other Dexterity-related abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even if a character&rsquo;s Dexterity bonus to AC drops to 0 because of armor, this situation does not count as losing his Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A character&rsquo;s encumbrance (the amount of gear carried, including armor) may also restrict the maximum Dexterity bonus that can be applied to his Armor Class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shields</h2>\n<p>Shields do not affect a character&rsquo;s maximum Dexterity bonus, except for tower shields.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Armor Check Penalty</h2>\n<p>Any armor heavier than leather, as well as any shield, hurts a character&rsquo;s ability to use Dexterity- and Strength-based skills. An armor check penalty applies to all Dexterity- and Strength-based skill checks. A character&rsquo;s encumbrance may also incur an armor check penalty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shields</h2>\n<p>If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both armor check penalties apply.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nonproficient with Armor Worn</h2>\n<p>A character who wears armor and/or uses a shield with which he is not proficient takes the armor&rsquo;s (and/or shield&rsquo;s) armor check penalty on attack rolls as well as on all Dexterity- and Strength-based ability and skill checks. The penalty for nonproficiency with armor stacks with the penalty for shields.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sleeping in Armor</h2>\n<p>A character who sleeps in medium or heavy armor is automatically fatigued the next day. He takes a &ndash;2 penalty on Strength and Dexterity and can&rsquo;t charge or run. Sleeping in light armor does not cause fatigue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Arcane Spell Failure Chance</h2>\n<p>Armor interferes with the gestures that a spellcaster must make to cast an arcane spell that has a somatic component. Arcane spellcasters face the possibility of arcane spell failure if they&rsquo;re wearing armor. Bards can wear light armor and use shields without incurring any arcane spell failure chance for their bard spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Casting an Arcane Spell in Armor</h2>\n<p>A character who casts an arcane spell while wearing armor must usually make an arcane spell failure check. The number in the Arcane Spell Failure Chance column on Table 6&ndash;6 is the percentage chance that the spell fails and is ruined. If the spell lacks a somatic component, however, it can be cast with no chance of arcane spell failure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shields</h2>\n<p>If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, add the two numbers together to get a single arcane spell failure chance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Speed</h2>\n<p>Medium or heavy armor slows the wearer down. The number on Table 6&ndash;6 is the character&rsquo;s speed while wearing the armor. Humans, elves, half-elves, and halforcs have an unencumbered speed of 30 feet. They use the first column. Dwarves, gnomes, and half lings have an unencumbered speed of 20 feet. They use the second column. Remember, however, that a dwarf &rsquo;s land speed remains 20 feet even in medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shields</h2>\n<p>Shields do not affect a character&rsquo;s speed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weight</h2>\n<p>This column gives the weight of the armor sized for a Medium wearer. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and armor for Large characters weighs twice as much.</p>"}

Descriptive Text}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 215</em></p>\n<p>A spell&rsquo;s duration entry tells you how long the magical energy of the spell lasts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Timed Durations</h2>\n<p>Many durations are measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or other increments. When the time is up, the magic goes away and the spell ends. If a spell&rsquo;s duration is variable, the duration is rolled secretly so the caster doesn&rsquo;t know how long the spell will last.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Instantaneous</h2>\n<p>The spell energy comes and goes the instant the spell is cast, though the consequences might be long-lasting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Permanent</h2>\n<p>The energy remains as long as the effect does. This means the spell is vulnerable to dispel magic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Concentration</h2>\n<p>The spell lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Anything that could break your concentration when casting a spell can also break your concentration while you&rsquo;re maintaining one, causing the spell to end. See concentration on page 206.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t cast a spell while concentrating on another one. Some spells last for a short time after you cease concentrating.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Subjects, Effects, and Areas</h2>\n<p>If the spell affects creatures directly, the result travels with the subjects for the spell&rsquo;s duration. If the spell creates an effect, the effect lasts for the duration. The effect might move or remain still. Such an effect can be destroyed prior to when its duration ends. If the spell affects an area, then the spell stays with that area for its duration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Creatures become subject to the spell when they enter the area and are no longer subject to it when they leave.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Touch Spells and Holding the Charge</h2>\n<p>In most cases, if you don&rsquo;t discharge a touch spell on the round you cast it, you can hold the charge (postpone the discharge of the spell) indefinitely. You can make touch attacks round after round until the spell is discharged. If you cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some touch spells allow you to touch multiple targets as part of the spell. You can&rsquo;t hold the charge of such a spell; you must touch all targets of the spell in the same round that you finish casting the spell. Discharge: Occasionally a spells lasts for a set duration or until triggered or discharged.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>(D) Dismissible</h2>\n<p>If the duration line ends with &ldquo;(D),&rdquo; you can dismiss the spell at will. You must be within range of the spell&rsquo;s effect and must speak words of dismissal, which are usually a modified form of the spell&rsquo;s verbal component. If the spell has no verbal component, you can dismiss the effect with a gesture. Dismissing a spell is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A spell that depends on concentration is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does not take an action, since all you have to do to end the spell is to stop concentrating on your turn.</p>"}

If a character takes a standard or full-round action, the remaining duration that the character can hold her breath is reduced by 1 round. After this period of time, the character must make a DC 10 Constitution check in order to continue holding her breath. The check must be repeated each round, with the DC increasing by +1 for each previous success.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When the character fails one of these Constitution checks, she begins to suffocate. In the first round, she falls unconscious (0 hit points). In the following round, she drops to &ndash;1 hit points and is dying. In the third round, she suffocates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Slow Suffocation</h2>\n<p>A Medium character can breathe easily for 6 hours in a sealed chamber measuring 10 feet on a side. After that time, the character takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage every 15 minutes. Each additional Medium character or significant fire source (a torch, for example) proportionally reduces the time the air will last. Once rendered unconscious through the accumulation of nonlethal damage, the character begins to take lethal damage at the same rate. Small characters consume half as much air as Medium characters.</p>"}

Slimes, Molds, and Fungi}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 411</em></p>\n<p>As with walls, dungeon floors come in many types.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Flagstone</h2>\n<p>Like masonry walls, flagstone floors are made of fitted stones. They are usually cracked and only somewhat level. Slime and mold grows in the cracks. Sometimes water runs in rivulets between the stones or sits in stagnant puddles. Flagstone is the most common dungeon floor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Uneven Flagstone</h2>\n<p>Over time, some floors can become so uneven that a DC 10 Acrobatics check is required to run or charge across the surface. Failure means the character can&rsquo;t move that round. Floors as treacherous as this should be the exception, not the rule.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hewn Stone Floors</h2>\n<p>Rough and uneven, hewn floors are usually covered with loose stones, gravel, dirt, or other debris. A DC 10 Acrobatics check is required to run or charge across such a floor. Failure means the character can still act, but can&rsquo;t run or charge in this round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Light Rubble</h2>\n<p>Small chunks of debris litter the ground. Light rubble adds 2 to the DC of Acrobatics checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dense Rubble</h2>\n<p>The ground is covered with debris of all sizes. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a square with dense rubble. Dense rubble adds 5 to the DC of Acrobatics checks, and it adds 2 to the DC of Stealth checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Smooth Stone Floors</h2>\n<p>Finished and sometimes even polished, smooth floors are found only in dungeons made by capable and careful builders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Natural Stone Floors</h2>\n<p>The floor of a natural cave is as uneven as the walls. Caves rarely have flat surfaces of any great size. Rather, their floors have many levels. Some adjacent floor surfaces might vary in elevation by only a foot, so that moving from one to the other is no more difficult than negotiating a stair step, but in other places the floor might suddenly drop off or rise up several feet or more, requiring Climb checks to get from one surface to the other. Unless a path has been worn and well marked in the floor of a natural cave, it takes 2 squares of movement to enter a square with a natural stone floor, and the DC of Acrobatics checks increases by 5. Running and charging are impossible, except along paths.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Slippery</h2>\n<p>Water, ice, slime, or blood can make any of the dungeon floors described in this section more treacherous. Slippery floors increase the DC of Acrobatics checks by 5.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Grate</h2>\n<p>A grate often covers a pit or an area lower than the main floor. Grates are usually made from iron, but large ones can also be made from iron-bound timbers. Many grates have hinges to allow access to what lies below (such grates can be locked like any door), while others are permanent and designed to not move. A typical 1-inch-thick iron grate has 25 hit points, hardness 10, and a DC of 27 for Strength checks to break through it or tear it loose.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ledge</h2>\n<p>Ledges allow creatures to walk above some lower area. They often circle around pits, run along underground streams, form balconies around large rooms, or provide a place for archers to stand while firing upon enemies below. Narrow ledges (12 inches wide or less) require those moving along them to make Acrobatics checks. Failure results in the moving character falling off the ledge. Ledges sometimes have railings along the wall. In such a case, characters gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks to move along the ledge. A character who is next to a railing gains a +2 circumstance bonus to his CMD to avoid being bull rushed off the edge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ledges can also have low walls 2 to 3 feet high along their edges. Such walls provide cover against attackers within 30 feet on the other side of the wall, as long as the target is closer to the low wall than the attacker is.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Transparent Floor</h2>\n<p>Transparent floors, made of reinforced glass or magic materials (even a wall of force), allow a dangerous setting to be viewed safely from above. Transparent floors are sometimes placed over lava pools, arenas, monster dens, and torture chambers. They can be used by defenders to watch key areas for intruders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sliding Floors</h2>\n<p>A sliding floor is a type of trap door, designed to be moved and thus reveal something that lies beneath it. A typical sliding floor moves so slowly that anyone standing on one can avoid falling into the gap it creates, assuming there&rsquo;s somewhere else to go. If such a floor slides quickly enough that there&rsquo;s a chance of a character falling into whatever lies beneath&mdash;a spiked pit, a vat of burning oil, or a pool filled with sharks&mdash;then it&rsquo;s a trap.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Trap Floors</h2>\n<p>Some floors are designed to become suddenly dangerous. With the application of just the right amount of weight, or the pull of a lever somewhere nearby, spikes protrude from the floor, gouts of steam or flame shoot up from hidden holes, or the entire floor tilts. These strange floors are sometimes found in arenas, designed to make combats more exciting and deadly. Construct these floors as you would any other trap.</p>"}

The qlippoth&rsquo;s unpredictable nature, horrific appearance, and hatred for all mortal life make them some of the most dangerous outsiders to summon. They were once rulers of the Abyss, but were overthrown when the souls of mortal sinners arrived and transformed into the first demons. While qlippoth may bargain with mortal spellcasters, they don&rsquo;t feel bound to follow such agreements, and often blatantly disregard the orders of their binders, no matter the consequences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Qlippoth are immune to cold, mind-affecting effects, and poison. They have resistance to acid 10, electricity 10, and fire 10. All but the least have an aura of fear and madness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Augnagar</h2>\n<p>Stupid and ravenous, these cannibalistic qlippoth rarely bargain with their binders, but can be threatened into what passes for qlippoth service.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Chernobue (SR 23)</h2>\n<p>These flopping and writhing things are only concerned with spreading their vile poison. They do not bargain with binders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cythnigot</h2>\n<p>The most common type of qlippoth found on the Material Plane, cythnigots are called by some chaotic evil spellcasters to act as familiars; a cythnigot latches on to a Tiny animal familiar the spellcaster already has.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Iathavos (SR 31)</h2>\n<p>The powerful and singular iathavos never answers the call of a binder, even an epic one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nyogoth</h2>\n<p>These hungry, abyssal bottom feeders heed the calls of spellcasters, but typically only to find new things to eat in far-off places. Though not stupid, nyogoths are hard to reason with, and only respond when offered new and interesting things to eat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shoggti</h2>\n<p>Next to cythnigots, shoggti are the most common qlippoth found on the Material Plane. These masters of mind manipulation are always on the hunt for living slaves for their inexplicable plans. A shoggti quickly heeds the call of a binder, hoping to eventually turn her into its newest thrall.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Thulgant (SR 25 vs. lawful spells and creatures)</h2>\n<p>These powerful qlippoth are too arrogant and self-important to answer the call of a spellcaster wishing to bind them.</p>"}

This radioactive mineral emits a magical radiation that registers a faint aura of transmutation magic to detect magic, though caphorite itself has no magical qualities and no effective caster level. Living creatures suffer no ill effects from caphorite radiation; however, plants exposed to caphorite radiation tend to grow more quickly, and with long-term exposure (over the course of several generations), they sometimes develop rudimentary sentience. Additionally, anyone attempting to cast a spell with the light descriptor within 30 feet of caphorite must succeed at a DC 15 caster level check or have the spell disrupted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Caphorite Ammunition</h2>\n<p>This ammunition typically consists of crossbow bolts, often employed by drow house guards. A caphorite arrow or bolt detonates on impact, its head shattering in a mass of fine caphorite particulate. Any nonmagical light in a 10-foot radius is immediately extinguished, while spells of 2nd level or lower with the light descriptor are rendered inactive for 1d4+1 rounds. Higher-level spells with the light descriptor are unaffected. Caphorite ammunition has a cost of +10 gp per item.</p>"}

Dungeon Terrain}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 410</em></p>\n<p>The four basic dungeon types are defined by their current status. Many dungeons are variations on these basic types or combinations of more than one of them. Sometimes old dungeons are used again and again by different inhabitants for different purposes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ruined Structure</h2>\n<p>Once occupied, this place is now abandoned (completely or in part) by its original creator or creators, and other creatures have wandered in. Many subterranean creatures look for abandoned underground constructions in which to make their lairs. Any traps that might exist have probably been set off, but wandering beasts might very well be common.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Occupied Structure</h2>\n<p>This type of dungeon is still in use. Creatures (usually intelligent) live there, although they might not be the dungeon&rsquo;s creators. An occupied structure might be a home, a fortress, a temple, an active mine, a prison, or a headquarters. This type of dungeon is less likely to have traps or wandering beasts, and more likely to have organized guards&mdash;both on watch and on patrol. Traps or wandering beasts that might be encountered are usually under the control of the occupants. Occupied structures have furnishings to suit the inhabitants, as well as decorations, supplies, and the ability for occupants to move around. The inhabitants might have a communication system, and they almost certainly control an exit to the outside.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some dungeons are partially occupied and partially empty or in ruins. In such cases, the occupants are typically not the original builders, but instead a group of intelligent creatures that have set up their base, lair, or fortification within an abandoned dungeon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Safe Storage</h2>\n<p>When people want to protect something, they sometimes bury it underground. Whether the item they want to protect is a fabulous treasure, a forbidden artifact, or the dead body of an important figure, these valuable objects are placed within a dungeon and surrounded by barriers, traps, and guardians. The safe storage dungeon is the most likely to have traps but the least likely to have wandering beasts. This type of dungeon is normally built for function rather than appearance, but sometimes it has ornamentation in the form of statuary or painted walls. This is particularly true of the tombs of important people.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, a vault or a crypt is constructed in such a way as to house living guardians. The problem with this strategy is that something must be done to keep the creatures alive between intrusion attempts. Magic is usually the best solution to provide food and water for these creatures. Builders of vaults or tombs often use undead creatures or constructs, both of which have no need for sustenance or rest, to guard their dungeons. Magic traps can attack intruders by summoning monsters into the dungeon that disappear when their task is done.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Natural Cavern Complex</h2>\n<p>Underground caves provide homes for all sorts of subterranean monsters. Created naturally and connected by labyrinthine tunnel systems, these caverns lack any sort of pattern, order, or decoration. With no intelligent force behind its construction, this type of dungeon is the least likely to have traps or even doors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fungi of all sorts thrive in caves, sometimes growing in huge forests of mushrooms and puff balls. Subterranean predators prowl these forests, looking for weaker creatures feeding upon the fungi. Some varieties of fungus give off a phosphorescent glow, providing a natural cavern complex with its own limited light source. In other areas, a daylight spell or similar magical effect can provide enough light for green plants to grow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Natural cavern complexes often connect with other types of dungeons, the caves having been discovered when the manufactured dungeons were delved. A cavern complex can connect two otherwise unrelated dungeons, sometimes creating a strange mixed environment. A natural cavern complex joined with another dungeon often provides a route by which subterranean creatures find their way into a manufactured dungeon and populate it.</p>"}

They eat souls, and stop at nothing to sate their hunger for them. Daemons are not to be trifled with. The greater lords of the daemons&mdash; the deacons and the Four Horsemen themselves&mdash;are almost never summoned. Whether this is because they force others to arrive in their place, or because they have somehow anchored themselves to the plane of Abaddon, none can say with certainty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Daemons are immune to acid, death effects, disease, and poison, and all are vulnerable to good and/or silver weapons. They have resistance to cold 10, electricity 10, and fire 10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Astradaemon (SR 27)</h2>\n<p>Powerful but relatively dim hunters of souls, astradaemons can only be bribed into service by two things&mdash;a feast of souls and the promise to spread death.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cacodaemon</h2>\n<p>Savage and hungry, most cacodaemons cannot suppress their savage natures long enough to make deals. At best, the binder can trick a cacodaemon toward actions in concert with her purposes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ceustodaemon</h2>\n<p>The most common daemons summoned to the Material Plane, ceustodaemons are relatively easy to deal with, though none know if this is because of some deliberate action by more powerful daemons. They are often called guardian daemons, as they are frequently bound to that task.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Derghodaemon (SR 23)</h2>\n<p>No one summons a derghodaemon unless they are stupid, desperate for the services of a savage killer, or both. Less intelligent than cacodaemons and twice as vicious, derghodaemons do not deal with any creature, and relentlessly attempt to escape their binding, usually with brute force.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hydrodaemon (SR 19)</h2>\n<p>On their home plane, these vile creatures swim the River Styx; on the Material Plane, they are often called to serve as guardians in swamps and sanctuaries of unscrupulous spellcasters. More pliable than most of their fiendish kin, hydrodaemons take treasure and the promise of souls as gifts for their services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Leukodaemon (SR 20)</h2>\n<p>Leukodaemons are the deacons of the Horseman of Pestilence, and on the rare occasions that they are summoned, they make any deal a binder wants, as long as it somehow results in the spreading of disease and devastation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Meladaemon (SR 22)</h2>\n<p>As deacons of the Horseman of Famine, meladaemons are rarely summoned by mortal spellcasters, and typically only agree to actions aligned with their own agendas or those of their lord.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Olethrodaemon (SR 31)</h2>\n<p>The mammoth olethrodaemons often make deals with mortals wishing to evoke devastation on rival lands, sometimes even asking only half the normal offering for the privilege. Even those olethrodaemons serving one of the Four Horsemen as paragons can be summoned, though it is often assumed that such a feat is done only at their master&rsquo;s whim.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Piscodaemon (SR 21)</h2>\n<p>Lovers of misery, especially that of the strong and powerful, piscodaemons eagerly make deals with mortals who wish to use them as soldiers against the powers of good&mdash;especially armies composed of or led by paladins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Purrodaemon (SR 29)</h2>\n<p>Steadfast servants of the Horseman of War, purrodaemons may be the easiest deacon daemons to summon. It seems their master often gives them leave to spread war on the Material Plane, but their service to any binder is often brief and violent, for both daemon and spellcaster.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Thanadaemon (SR 24)</h2>\n<p>As deacons of the Horseman of Death, thanadaemons are hardly ever summoned by mortal spellcasters, and when they are, the event portends a near-apocalyptic end of mortal life.</p>"}

To attack with a splash weapon, make a ranged touch attack against the target. Thrown splash weapons require no weapon proficiency, so you don&rsquo;t take the &ndash;4 nonproficiency penalty. A hit deals direct hit damage to the target and splash damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target. If the target is Large or larger, you choose one of its squares and the splash damage affects creatures within 5 feet of that square. Splash weapons cannot deal precision-based damage (such as sneak attack).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can instead target a specific grid intersection. Treat this as a ranged attack against AC 5. However, if you target a grid intersection, creatures in all adjacent squares are dealt the splash damage, and the direct hit damage is not dealt to any creature. You can&rsquo;t target a grid intersection occupied by a creature, such as a Large or larger creature; in this case, you&rsquo;re aiming at the creature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you miss the target (whether aiming at a creature or a grid intersection), roll 1d8. This determines the misdirection of the throw, with 1 falling short (off-target in a straight line toward the thrower), and 2 through 8 rotating around the target creature or grid intersection in a clockwise direction. Then, count a number of squares in the indicated direction equal to the range increment of the throw. After you determine where the weapon landed, it deals splash damage to all creatures in that square and in all adjacent squares.</p>"}

If the check is not made by 10 or more, but still succeeds, all that is revealed is the magic item&rsquo;s original intent. If the item is known to be cursed, the nature of the curse can be determined using the standard DC to identify the item.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Removing Cursed Items</h2>\n<p>While some cursed items can be simply discarded, others force a compulsion upon the user to keep the item, no matter the costs. Others reappear even if discarded or are impossible to throw away. These items can only be discarded after the character or item is targeted by a remove curse or similar magic. The DC of the caster level check to undo the curse is equal to 10 + the item&rsquo;s caster level.

Subraces}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Advanced Player's Guide pg. 8</em></p>\n<p>The following race discussions also describe alternate racial traits for each character race. It is important to note that these racial traits are not the same as the trait rules. Those traits are effectively half-feats, intended to tie characters to the specific nations, cultures, regions, and races of the Golarion campaign world. Racial traits, on the other hand, are those racial abilities described at the bottom of each race&rsquo;s descriptive page. Some races have few racial traits, like half-orcs and humans. Others, like dwarves and gnomes, have many. All of these racial traits represent typical members of the race and the kinds of special abilities they gain from their heritage, whether from biology, racial attitudes, or otherwise.</p>\n<p>This chapter also contains a list of alternate class features for each race. Some of them play on racial archetypes not reflected in the standard racial traits, like a gnome&rsquo;s love of languages or tinkering or a halfling&rsquo;s mastery of thrown items or of slipping through a battlefield under the feet of larger races. In order to choose one of these racial traits, you must exchange one or more of the existing racial traits available to your character. These racial traits replace a character&rsquo;s normal racial traits; they are not abilities gained in addition to them. In many cases, racial abilities are exchanged on a one-to-one basis; you give up one racial ability from the Core Rulebook to gain one presented in this book. In other cases, you may have to exchange more than one racial trait to take one of these alternate racial traits. For example, a gnome may eschew the militant path and exchange defensive training and hatred for the gift of tongues, while other magic-using gnomes might forgo the traditional gnome specialty of illusion magic to become a magical linguist or even a pyromaniac.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can exchange one or several of your character&rsquo;s normal racial traits, but of course you cannot exchange the same racial trait more than once. If a human exchanges the skilled trait to become either a child of the fields or a child of the street, she cannot exchange it twice to take both new traits. However, she could choose one of those as an alternate racial trait while also exchanging her bonus feat racial trait to gain an eye for talent.</p>\n<p>As with any alternate or optional rule, you must first get the permission of your GM to exchange any of your character&rsquo;s normal racial traits for those in this chapter.</p>"}

Magic Item Creation}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 460</em></p>\n<p>Magic items are valuable, and most major cities have at least one or two purveyors of magic items, from a simple potion merchant to a weapon smith that specializes in magic swords. Of course, not every item in this book is available in every town.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The following guidelines are presented to help GMs determine what items are available in a given community. These guidelines assume a setting with an average level of magic. Some cities might deviate wildly from these baselines, subject to GM discretion. The GM should keep a list of what items are available from each merchant and should replenish the stocks on occasion to represent new acquisitions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The number and types of magic items available in a community depend upon its size. Each community has a base value associated with it (see Table 15&ndash;1). There is a 75% chance that any item of that value or lower can be found for sale with little effort in that community. In addition, the community has a number of other items for sale. These items are randomly determined and are broken down by category (minor, medium, or major). After determining the number of items available in each category, refer to Table 15&ndash;2 to determine the type of each item (potion, scroll, ring, weapon, etc.) before moving on to the individual charts to determine the exact item. Reroll any items that fall below the community&rsquo;s base value.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are running a campaign with low magic, reduce the base value and the number of items in each community by half. Campaigns with little or no magic might not have magic items for sale at all. GMs running these sorts of campaigns should make some adjustments to the challenges faced by the characters due to their lack of magic gear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Campaigns with an abundance of magic items might have communities with twice the listed base value and random items available. Alternatively, all communities might count as one size category larger for the purposes of what items are available. In a campaign with very common magic, all magic items might be available for purchase in a metropolis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nonmagical items and gear are generally available in a community of any size unless the item is particularly expensive, such as full plate, or made of an unusual material, such as an adamantine longsword. These items should follow the base value guidelines to determine their availability, subject to GM discretion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>See Ultimate Equipement Compendium for roll tables</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 15-1: Available Magic Items</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 86.5836%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;

From sorcerer bloodlines to cleric domains, each of these specific rules are discussed here.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alchemist</h2>\n<p>The alchemist only learns the personal and selected target words. He uses words to create extracts as normal, but they can only target the drinker (in most cases, the alchemist himself ).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Clerics</h2>\n<p>A cleric chooses her domains as normal, and must use her domain spell slot to prepare a domain spell from one of her chosen domains. She cannot use that slot to prepare a wordspell. A cleric can spontaneously cast a wordspell containing an effect word from the Healing group or the Wounding group, but the spell cannot contain any other effect words. She can cast such wordspells by sacrificing an arranged and prepared wordspell (not a domain spell) of a level equal to the level of the spell she wishes to cast. Good clerics can only spontaneously cast wordspells with effect words from the Healing group, whereas evil clerics can only spontaneously cast wordspells with effect words from the Wounding group. Neutral clerics can elect to cast wordspells with either Healing or Wounding effect words, but once they have chosen, they cannot spontaneously cast spells with effect words from the other group, and this choice cannot be changed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Druids</h2>\n<p>A druid who selects a domain with the nature bond class feature must prepare a spell from her chosen domain spell list in her domain bonus spell slots. A druid can spontaneously cast a wordspell containing a word from the Summoning word group, but the spell cannot contain any other effect words. A druid can cast such a spell by sacrificing an arranged and prepared wordspell (not a domain spell) of a level equal to the level of the wordspell with the Summoning effect she wishes to cast.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Oracles and Sorcerers</h2>\n<p>Oracle and sorcerer wordcasters gain bonus spells from their mysteries or bloodlines respectively, just like their spellcasting counterparts, and can cast these spells in addition to their wordspells by using up the appropriate spell slots. They can exchange effect words for new effect words according to their normal progression, but may not exchange their mystery or bloodline bonus spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Witches</h2>\n<p>A witch receives bonus patron spells as normal and can prepare these spells using her spell slots. These spells are stored in her familiar, just like her target and effect words.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wizards</h2>\n<p>A wizard who belongs to an arcane school receives an additional spell slot of each level to prepare a wordspell of his chosen school. Such wordspells may only contain effect words from his chosen school. The wizard must also select two other schools to act as his opposition schools. He can prepare word spells using effect words from these schools, but each such spell fills two of his slots as normal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Multiclassing</h2>\n<p>Multiclass wordcasters must keep their words separate for each class. A multiclass cleric/wizard cannot use her cleric words with wizard spells, or vice versa.</p>"}

This takes 2d4 rounds and requires a DC 20 Disable Device check. Siege engines are typically made out of wood and have an AC of 3 (&ndash;5 Dex, &ndash;2 size), a Hardness of 5, and 80 hit points. Siege engines made up of a different material might have different values. Some siege engines are armored as well. Treat the siege engine as a Huge creature to determine the cost of such armor. Siege engines can be crafted as masterwork and enchanted as magic weapons, adding bonuses on attack rolls to the checks made to hit with the siege engine. A masterwork siege engine costs 300 gp more than the listed price. Enchanting a siege engine costs twice the normal amount. For example, a +1 flaming heavy catapult, armored with full plate, would have an AC of 11 and would cost 23,100 gp (800 gp base + 6,000 gp for the armor + 300 gp masterwork + 16,000 gp for the enhancements).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>For expanded Combat rules, see:</strong></p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.BA9GnqGPouWXISZm]{2.11.4.

Siege Engine Details}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Catapult, Heavy</h2>\n<p>A heavy catapult is a massive engine capable of throwing rocks or heavy objects with great force. Because the catapult throws its payload in a high arc, it can hit squares out of its line of sight. To fire a heavy catapult, the crew chief makes a special check against DC 15 using only his base attack bonus, Intelligence modifier, range increment penalty, and the appropriate modifiers from the lower section of Table 13&ndash;8. If the check succeeds, the catapult stone hits the square the catapult was aimed at, dealing the indicated damage to any object or character in the square. Characters who succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save take half damage. Once a catapult stone hits a square, subsequent shots hit the same square unless the catapult is reaimed or the wind changes direction or speed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a catapult stone misses, roll 1d8 to determine where it lands. This determines the misdirection of the throw, with 1 being back toward the catapult and 2 through 8 counting clockwise around the target square. Finally, count 1d4 squares away from the target square for every range increment of the attack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Loading a catapult requires a series of full-round actions. It takes a DC 15 Strength check to winch the throwing arm down; most catapults have wheels to allow up to two crew members to use the aid another action, assisting the main winch operator. A DC 15 Profession (siege engineer) check latches the arm into place, and then another DC 15 Profession (siege engineer) check loads the catapult ammunition. It takes four fullround actions to reaim a heavy catapult (multiple crew members can perform these full-round actions in the same round, so it would take a crew of four only 1 round to reaim the catapult).</p>\n<p>A heavy catapult takes up a space 15 feet across.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Catapult, Light</h2>\n<p>This is a smaller, lighter version of the heavy catapult. It functions as the heavy catapult, except that it takes a DC 10 Strength check to winch the arm into place, and only two full-round actions are required to reaim the catapult.</p>\n<p>A light catapult takes up a space 10 feet across.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ballista</h2>\n<p>A ballista is essentially a Huge heavy crossbow fixed in place. Its size makes it hard for most creatures to aim it. Thus, a Medium creature takes a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls when using a ballista, and a Small creature takes a &ndash;6 penalty. It takes a creature smaller than Large two full-round actions to reload the ballista after firing.</p>\n<p>A ballista takes up a space 5 feet across.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ram</h2>\n<p>This heavy pole is sometimes suspended from a movable scaffold that allows the crew to swing it back and forth against objects. As a full-round action, the character closest to the front of the ram makes an attack roll against the AC of the construction, applying the &ndash;4 penalty for lack of proficiency. It&rsquo;s not possible to be proficient with this device. In addition to the damage given on Table 13&ndash;8, up to nine other characters holding the ram can add their Strength modifiers to the ram&rsquo;s damage, if they devote an attack action to doing so. It takes at least one Huge or larger creature, two Large creatures, four Medium creatures, or eight Small creatures to swing a ram.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A ram is typically 30 feet long. In a battle, the creatures wielding the ram stand in two adjacent columns of equal length, with the ram between them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Siege Tower</h2>\n<p>This device is a massive wooden tower on wheels or rollers that can be rolled up against a wall to allow attackers to scale the tower and thus get to the top of the wall with cover. The wooden walls are usually 1 foot thick.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A typical siege tower takes up a space 15 feet across. The creatures inside push it at a base land speed of 10 feet (and a siege tower can&rsquo;t run).

Adding New Abilities}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 549</em></p>\n<p>Many factors must be considered when determining the price of new magic items. The easiest way to come up with a price is to compare the new item to an item that is already priced, using that price as a guide. Otherwise, use the guidelines summarized on Table 15&ndash;29.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Multiple Similar Abilities</p>\n<p>For items with multiple similar abilities that don&rsquo;t take up space on a character&rsquo;s body, use the following formula: Calculate the price of the single most costly ability, then add 75% of the value of the next most costly ability, plus 1/2 the value of any other abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Multiple Different Abilities</p>\n<p>Abilities such as an attack roll bonus or saving throw bonus and a spell-like function are not similar, and their values are simply added together to determine the cost. For items that take up a space on a character&rsquo;s body, each additional power not only has no discount but instead has a 50% increase in price.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>0-Level Spells</p>\n<p>When multiplying spell levels to determine value, 0-level spells should be treated as 1/2 level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other Considerations</p>\n<p>Once you have a cost figure, reduce that number if either of the following conditions applies:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Item Requires Skill to Use</p>\n<p>Some items require a specific skill to get them to function. This factor should reduce the cost about 10%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Item Requires Specific Class or Alignment to Use</p>\n<p>Even more restrictive than requiring a skill, this limitation cuts the price by 30%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Prices presented in the magic item descriptions (the gold piece value following the item&rsquo;s slot) are the market value, which is generally twice what it costs the creator to make the item. Since different classes get access to certain spells at different levels, the prices for two characters to make the same item might actually be different. An item is only worth two times what the caster of the lowest possible level can make it for. Calculate the market price based on the lowest possible level caster, no matter who makes the item.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not all items adhere to these formulas. First and foremost, these few formulas aren&rsquo;t enough to truly gauge the exact differences between items. The price of a magic item may be modified based on its actual worth. The formulas only provide a starting point. The pricing of scrolls assumes that, whenever possible, a wizard or cleric created it. Potions and wands follow the formulas exactly. Staves follow the formulas closely, and other items require at least some judgment calls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 15-29: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values</h2>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">Effect</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Base Price</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Example</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ability bonus (enhancement)</td>\n<td>Bonus squared &times; 1,000 gp</td>\n<td>Belt of incredible dexterity +2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Armor bonus (enhancement)</td>\n<td>Bonus squared &times; 1,000 gp</td>\n<td>+1 chainmail</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bonus spell</td>\n<td>Spell level squared &times; 1,000 gp</td>\n<td>Pearl of power</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AC bonus (deflection)</td>\n<td>bonus squared &times; 2,000 gp</td>\n<td>Ring of protection +3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AC bonus (other)1</td>\n<td>bonus squared &times; 2,500 gp</td>\n<td>Ioun stone (dusty rose prism)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Natural armor bonus (enhancement)</td>\n<td>bonus squared &times; 2,000 gp</td>\n<td>Amulet of natural armor +1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Save bonus (resistance)</td>\n<td>bonus squared &times; 1,000 gp</td>\n<td>Cloak of resistance +5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Save bonus (other)1</td>\n<td>bonus squared &times; 2,000 gp</td>\n<td>Stone of good luck</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Skill bonus (competence)</td>\n<td>bonus squared &times; 100 gp</td>\n<td>Cloak of elvenkind</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spell resistance</td>\n<td>10,000 gp per point over SR 12; SR 13 minimum</td>\n<td>Mantle of spell resistance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weapon bonus (enhancement)</td>\n<td>bonus squared &times; 2,000 gp</td>\n<td>+1 longsword</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spell Effect</td>\n<td>Base Price</td>\n<td>Example</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Single use, spell completion</td>\n<td>Spell level &times; caster level &times; 25 gp</td>\n<td>Scroll of haste</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Single use, use-activated</td>\n<td>Spell level &times; caster level &times; 50 gp</td>\n<td>Potion of cure light wounds</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 charges, spell trigger</td>\n<td>Spell level &times; caster level &times; 750 gp</td>\n<td>Wand of fireball</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Command word</td>\n<td>Spell level &times; caster level &times; 1,800 gp</td>\n<td>Cape of the mountebank</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Use-activated or continuous</td>\n<td>Spell level &times; caster level &times; 2,000 gp2</td>\n<td>Lantern of revealing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Special</td>\n<td>Base Price Adjustment</td>\n<td>Example</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Charges per day</td>\n<td>Divide by (5 divided by charges per day)</td>\n<td>Boots of teleportation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>No space limitation3</td>\n<td>Multiply entire cost by 2</td>\n<td>Ioun stone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Multiple different abilities</td>\n<td>Multiply lower item cost by 1.5</td>\n<td>Helm of brilliance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Charged (50 charges)</td>\n<td>1/2 unlimited use base price</td>\n<td>Ring of the ram</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Component</td>\n<td>Extra Cost</td>\n<td>Example</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Armor, shield, or weapon</td>\n<td>Add cost of masterwork item</td>\n<td>+1 composite longbow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spell has material component cost</td>\n<td>Add directly into price of item per charge4</td>\n<td>Wand of stoneskin</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Spell Level: A 0-level spell is half the value of a 1st-level spell for determining price.<br />1 Such as a luck, insight, sacred, or profane bonus.<br />2 If a continuous item has an effect based on a spell with a duration measured in rounds, multiply the cost by 4.

Reviving and Replacing Companions}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>One of the surest ways to complicate the relationship between an adventurer and her animal companion is to cast awaken on the beast. The moment the spell takes effect, an animal companion ceases to be a class feature, and instead becomes a person&mdash;an NPC whose Intelligence has increased by 3d6 (potentially making it as smart as or smarter than the caster), and who has an increased Charisma score and knows at least one spoken language.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An adventurer considering awakening his animal companion should keep in mind the awaken spell&rsquo;s potential drawbacks. Most pointedly, awakened animals can no longer serve as companions, and the character must follow the rules for Leadership if he wishes to take the animal as an official cohort. Further, an intelligent animal can be difficult to manage. After awakening, animals are predisposed to be friendly toward whoever cast the spell&mdash; in this case, presumably their masters. Yet if an animal was mistreated during its time as a companion, or is treated poorly after its awakening, that friendliness is mixed with a sense of confusion that can last anywhere from a few moments to a few hours as the animal reconciles the abuse with the great gift it&rsquo;s been given.</p>\n<p>Since awaken is not a charm or mind-control spell, there&rsquo;s nothing to prevent awakened animals from resenting mistreatment in the same way a normal person of their intelligence level would, and they&rsquo;re no more inclined to be automatically servile than anyone else. More than one careless druid has found her awakened animal companion refusing to follow instructions, leaving to pursue its own goals, or even seeking vengeance for its former &ldquo;enslavement.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the flip side, there are many advantages to awakening an animal companion. If treated well, an awakened animal may become a valuable member of an adventuring party, adding new perspective to problems and fighting alongside its friends. Awakened animals can also make stealthy and reliable snoops (for who guards her words in front of a dog?), teach adventurers about their native environments, act as guides, and provide a valuable surprise weapon against enemies who think them mere brutes. Druids, in particular, may find awakening animal companions appealing&mdash;either because they wish to become true friends with their companions, or because they would value the animals&lsquo; skills as allies. A devious druid, upon witnessing an enemy mistreating its companion, may even cast awaken in secret upon the beast, trusting that its natural instincts will make it turn on its oppressor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although the personalities of awakened animals are as varied as those of adventurers, augmented animals often exhibit traits hearkening back to their species. Similarly, certain types of animals may favor specific classes, battle tactics, or even weapons. The following are examples of some broad animal groups&rsquo; commonalities.</p>\n<h2>Avians</h2>\n<p>Raptors such as eagles, hawks, and owls&mdash;as well as more bizarre fliers&mdash;tend to develop aloof, detached personalities, while smaller individuals are often more social and high-strung. Awakened avian animals keenly observe the world around them&mdash;often understanding it much better than their demure natures might imply&mdash; and are adept at inferring others&rsquo; desires, motives, and intentions. These intelligent flyers are shrewdly calculating and opportunistic, especially when it comes to ensuring their own survival. Awakened birds can often be found high above a fracas, coldly deciding on the best course of action, and only entering a fray when it&rsquo;s in their best interest or that of their friends.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, avian animals enjoy taking opponents by surprise, favoring training as rogues and ninjas, though they may also enjoy a bard&rsquo;s ability to soar above the fray and inspire with their songs and majestic screeches. In these capacities, the birds often use their winged stealth to their advantage, taking cover in trees and then striking quickly and silently. Awakened avian animals use their natural weapons, but often with a twist&mdash;devious awakened flyers have been known to drop smoke shot, chain shot, and even bombs on unsuspecting enemies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Land Mammals (Large)</h2>\n<p>Relishing their brute size and strength, large mammals&mdash;such as bison, lions, and rhinoceroses&mdash;tend to divide along predator/prey lines. Herbivores tend to be generally docile but easily spooked or enraged, while predators are aggressive and cunning, constantly seeking social dominance. Whether they&rsquo;re among cowering villagers or in a raiding party, these animals love to tell stories of their physical prowess, and awakened large animals tend to be the worst kind of braggadocios.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In combat, most large animals gravitate toward brash, volatile tactics, becoming barbarians or fighters who enjoy wading into battle before thinking. The exceptions are those hunters like the great cats that rely on stealth and tracking, who are just as likely to become rogues or rangers as they are to become barbarians. Some large mammals, however, have been known to become samurai, replacing their natural affinity for recklessness with precision and discipline.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Large mammals recognize the value in using their natural weapons, and augment those weapons in any way they can. For a rhinoceros, that might mean sharpening its deadly horn, while a lion might tip its claws with poison and a bison might overrun its enemies with spiked chainmail affixed to its chest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Land Mammals (Small and Medium)</h2>\n<p>Encompassing perhaps the widest variety of species&mdash;including creatures like cheetahs, hyenas, ponies, and weasels&mdash;Small and&nbsp;Medium mammals tend to adopt mischievous, resourceful personalities when awakened. Used to living in vast ecosystems full of larger predators, these creatures are accustomed to using any advantage they have, banding together with allies or manipulating others to serve their own designs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In battle, these animals tend to be smart and savvy, shrewd at observing situations and determining whether it would be most advantageous to fight or run. Those animals who prefer combat to diplomacy tend to value speed and stealth, thus making barbarians and rogues natural choices, yet the natural curiosity of many smaller animals may also lead them to the study of magic, from wizardry to druidism, which brings their own environments under their control. These creatures tend to be opportunistic, perpetually on the lookout for interesting magic items to help augment their natural abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Aquatic Animals</h2>\n<p>Often as mysterious as the depths in which they live, ocean dwellers are predisposed to developing deep, philosophical personalities when awakened. The reflective natures of animals such as giant squid, whales, and dolphins typically manifest in one of two ways: they either find majesty in nature or adopt a religion. Once awakened, aquatic animals also tend to be the most creative and artistic group of creatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of all awakened creatures, aquatic animals are the most likely to become clerics or paladins&mdash;or cult leaders, for that matter. Aquatic animals who eschew religion may instead pursue training as druids or bards, or crave the intellectual stimulation of wizardry. In battle, aquatic animals prefer to rely on the gifts their personal beliefs provide, casting divine spells or weaving intricate battle songs and spells. As a rule, aquatic animals eschew combat and fight only when necessary for survival unless an enemy threatens something the animal holds sacred. Because they so dislike combat, aquatic animals rarely alter their natural weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Primates</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the most human in their perspectives, augmented primates such as monkeys, baboons, and gorillas tend to have a wide range of personalities. Most are highly social and communicative, though this does not always make them great allies as they form intense attachments, manipulate others, and vie for dominance. Perhaps reflecting their impulsive personalities, primates generally pursue whatever paths seem appropriate in any given moment, and are likely to multiclass, training as anything from barbarians, fighters, rangers, and rogues, to exotic callings such as gunslingers and even magi. Those smaller primates used to traveling quickly through trees make great burglars and sailors, while gorillas and chimpanzees make better mercenaries and berserkers, charging into foes with terrifying force. The weapons primates wield also run the gamut. A gorilla might choose an enormous club, a chimpanzee a two-handed sword that lets him take advantage of his tremendous strength, and a monkey a hand crossbow or blunderbuss.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Reptiles</h2>\n<p>From the lizard to the constrictor snake to the ankylosaurus, awakened reptiles tend to be haughty and disdainful toward others. They eschew company whenever possible, preferring instead to be alone with their increasingly complex thoughts. Although their gruff exteriors can be off-putting, once an adventurer has earned an awakened reptile&rsquo;s friendship, it lasts for a lifetime.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When they are forced to pursue a discipline, smaller reptiles favor esoteric orders and studies, perhaps becoming druids, oracles, or even witches, while larger reptiles&mdash;such as dinosaurs&mdash;are often content to remain savagely effective barbarians. Poisonous creatures might become rogues, ninjas, and assassins, supplementing their own poisons with those of others. Though not necessarily evil, reptiles often retain predatory streaks that can seem cruel to others, and some crave violence and the thrill of the hunt over all. In combat, as in most things, reptiles rarely show anger or passion, instead pursuing their goals with cold, emotionless drive, their expressions nearly impossible for other creatures to read.</p>"}

The most common features are discussed below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alchemical Item</h2>\n<p>Mechanical traps might incorporate alchemical devices or other special substances or items, such as tanglefoot bags, alchemist&rsquo;s fire, thunderstones, and the like. Some such items mimic spell effects. If the item mimics a spell effect, it increases the CR as shown on Table 13&ndash;3: CR Modifiers for Mechanical Traps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Gas</h2>\n<p>With a gas trap, the danger is in the inhaled poison it delivers. Traps employing gas usually have the never miss and onset delay features.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Liquid</h2>\n<p>Any trap that involves a danger of drowning is in this category. Traps employing liquid usually have the never miss and onset delay features.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Multiple Targets</h2>\n<p>Traps with this feature can affect more than one character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Never Miss</h2>\n<p>When the entire dungeon wall moves to crush you, your quick reflexes won&rsquo;t help, since the wall can&rsquo;t possibly miss. A trap with this feature has neither an attack bonus nor a saving throw to avoid, but it does have an onset delay. Most traps involving liquid or gas are of the never miss variety.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Onset Delay</h2>\n<p>An onset delay is the amount of time between when the trap is sprung and when it deals damage. A never miss trap always has an onset delay.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Poison</h2>\n<p>Traps that employ poison are deadlier than their nonpoisonous counterparts, so they have correspondingly higher CRs. To determine the CR modifier for a given poison, consult Table 13&ndash;3. Only injury, contact, and inhaled poisons are suitable for traps; ingested types are not. Some traps simply deal the poison&rsquo;s damage. Others deal damage with ranged or melee attacks as well. See page 557 for more information on poison.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pit Spikes</h2>\n<p>Treat spikes at the bottom of a pit as daggers, each with a +10 attack bonus. The damage bonus for each spike is +1 per 10 feet of pit depth (to a maximum of +5). Each character who falls into the pit is attacked by 1d4 spikes. This damage is in addition to any damage from the fall itself, and the statistics presented above are merely the most common variant&mdash;some traps might have far more dangerous spikes at their bottom. Pit spikes add to the average damage of the trap (see Average Damage, below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pit Bottom</h2>\n<p>If something other than spikes waits at the bottom of a pit, it&rsquo;s best to treat that as a separate trap (see Multiple Traps) with a location trigger that activates on any significant impact, such as a falling character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Touch Attack</h2>\n<p>This feature applies to any trap that needs only a successful touch attack (melee or ranged) to hit.</p>"}

Magic Item Creation}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 458</em></p>\n<p>To use a magic item, it must be activated, although sometimes activation simply means putting a ring on your f inger. Some items, once donned, function constantly. In most cases, though, using an item requires a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. By contrast, spell completion items are treated like spells in combat and do provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>Activating a magic item is a standard action unless the item description indicates otherwise. However, the casting time of a spell is the time required to activate the same power in an item, regardless of the type of magic item, unless the item description specifically states otherwise.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The four ways to activate magic items are described below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Completion</h2>\n<p>This is the activation method for scrolls. A scroll is a spell that is mostly finished. The preparation is done for the caster, so no preparation time is needed beforehand as with normal spellcasting. All that&rsquo;s left to do is perform the finishing parts of the spellcasting (the final gestures, words, and so on). To use a spell completion item safely, a character must be of high enough level in the right class to cast the spell already. If he can&rsquo;t already cast the spell, there&rsquo;s a chance he&rsquo;ll make a mistake. Activating a spell completion item is a standard action (or the spell&rsquo;s casting time, whichever is longer) and provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as casting a spell does.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Trigger</h2>\n<p>Spell trigger activation is similar to spell completion, but it&rsquo;s even simpler. No gestures or spell finishing is needed, just a special knowledge of spellcasting that an appropriate character would know, and a single word that must be spoken. Spell trigger items can be used by anyone whose class can cast the corresponding spell. This is the case even for a character who can&rsquo;t actually cast spells, such as a 3rd-level paladin. The user must still determine what spell is stored in the item before she can activate it. Activating a spell trigger item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Command Word</h2>\n<p>If no activation method is suggested either in the magic item description or by the nature of the item, assume that a command word is needed to activate it. Command word activation means that a character speaks the word and the item activates. No other special knowledge is needed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A command word can be a real word, but when this is the case, the holder of the item runs the risk of activating the item accidentally by speaking the word in normal conversation. More often, the command word is some seemingly nonsensical word, or a word or phrase from an ancient language no longer in common use. Activating a command word magic item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sometimes the command word to activate an item is written right on the item. Occasionally, it might be hidden within a pattern or design engraved on, carved into, or built into the item, or the item might bear a clue to the command word.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Knowledge (arcana) and Knowledge (history) skills might be useful in helping to identify command words or deciphering clues regarding them. A successful check against DC 30 is needed to come up with the word itself. If that check is failed, succeeding on a second check (DC 25) might provide some insight into a clue. The spells detect magic, identify, and analyze dweomer all reveal command words if the properties of the item are successfully identified.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Use Activated</h2>\n<p>This type of item simply has to be used in order to activate it. A character has to drink a potion, swing a sword, interpose a shield to def lect a blow in combat, look through a lens, sprinkle dust, wear a ring, or don a hat. Use activation is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears. Continually functioning items are practically always items that one wears. A few must simply be in the character&rsquo;s possession (meaning on his person). However, some items made for wearing must still be activated. Although this activation sometimes requires a command word (see above), usually it means mentally willing the activation to happen. The description of an item states whether a command word is needed in such a case.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated magic item is either a standard action or not an action at all and does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an action that provokes an attack of opportunity in itself. If the use of the item takes time before a magical effect occurs, then use activation is a standard action. If the item&rsquo;s activation is subsumed in its use and takes no extra time use, activation is not an action at all.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Use activation doesn&rsquo;t mean that if you use an item, you automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess) what the item can do and then use the item in order to activate it, unless the benef it of the item comes automatically, such as from drinking a potion or swinging a sword.</p>"}

A trap typically is defined by its location and triggering conditions, how hard it is to spot before it goes off, how much damage it deals, and whether or not the characters receive a saving throw to mitigate its effects. Traps that attack with arrows, sweeping blades, and other types of weaponry make normal attack rolls, with specific attack bonuses dictated by the trap&rsquo;s design. A mechanical trap can be constructed by a PC through successful use of the Craft (traps) skill (see Designing a Trap on page 423 and the skill description on page 91).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Creatures that succeed on a Perception check detect a trap before it is triggered. The DC of this check depends on the trap itself. Success generally indicates that the creature has detected the mechanism that activates the trap, such as a pressure plate, odd gears attached to a door handle, and the like. Beating this check by 5 or more also gives some indication of what the trap is designed to do.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic</h2>\n<p>Many spells can be used to create dangerous traps. Unless the spell or item description states otherwise, assume the following to be true.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A successful Perception check (DC 25 + spell level) detects a magic trap before it goes off.</li>\n<li>Magic traps permit a saving throw in order to avoid the effect (DC 10 + spell level &times; 1.5).</li>\n<li>Magic traps may be disarmed by a character with the trapfinding class feature with a successful Disable Device skill check (DC 25 + spell level). Other characters have no chance to disarm a magic trap with a Disable Device check.</li>\n<li>Magic traps are further divided into spell traps and magic device traps. Magic device traps initiate spell effects when activated, just as wands, rods, rings, and other magic items do. Creating a magic device trap requires the Craft Wondrous Item feat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spell traps are simply spells that themselves function as traps. Creating a spell trap requires the services of a character who can cast the needed spell or spells, who is usually either the character creating the trap or an NPC spellcaster hired for that purpose.</p>"}

Some individually targeted spells can be directed at several creatures simultaneously. In such cases, a creature&rsquo;s spell resistance applies only to the portion of the spell actually targeted at that creature. If several different resistant creatures are subjected to such a spell, each checks its spell resistance separately.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Area Spells</h2>\n<p>Spell resistance applies if the resistant creature is within the spell&rsquo;s area. It protects the resistant creature without affecting the spell itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Effect Spells</h2>\n<p>Most effect spells summon or create something and are not subject to spell resistance. Sometimes, however, spell resistance applies to effect spells, usually to those that act upon a creature more or less directly.</p>\n<p>Spell resistance can protect a creature from a spell that&rsquo;s already been cast. Check spell resistance when the creature is first affected by the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Check spell resistance only once for any particular casting of a spell or use of a spell-like ability. If spell resistance fails the first time, it fails each time the creature encounters that same casting of the spell. Likewise, if the spell resistance succeeds the first time, it always succeeds. If the creature has voluntarily lowered its spell resistance and is then subjected to a spell, the creature still has a single chance to resist that spell later, when its spell resistance is back up.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spell resistance has no effect unless the energy created or released by the spell actually goes to work on the resistant creature&rsquo;s mind or body. If the spell acts on anything else and the creature is affected as a consequence, no roll is required. Spell-resistant creatures can be harmed by a spell when they are not being directly affected.</p>\n<p>Spell resistance does not apply if an effect fools the creature&rsquo;s senses or reveals something about the creature.</p>\n<p>Magic actually has to be working for spell resistance to apply. Spells that have instantaneous durations but lasting results aren&rsquo;t subject to spell resistance unless the resistant creature is exposed to the spell the instant it is cast.</p>"}

Stealth and Perception often oppose one another, and the two of them together can be difficult to adjudicate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Active and Automatic Perception</strong>: There are two ways Perception checks happen in the game. The first way is automatic and reactive. Certain stimuli automatically call for a Perception check, such as a creature using Stealth (which calls for an opposed Perception check), or the sounds of combat or talking in the distance. The flip side is when a player actively calls for a Perception check because her PC is intentionally searching for something. This always takes at least a move action, but often takes significantly longer. The Core Rulebook doesn&rsquo;t specify what area a PC can actively search, but for a given Perception check it should be no larger than a 10-foot-by-10-foot area, and often a smaller space if that area is cluttered. For instance, in an intrigue-based game, it is fairly common to look through a filing cabinet full of files. Though the cabinet itself might fill only a 5-foot-by-5-foot area, the number of files present could cause a search to take a particularly long time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Precise and Imprecise Senses</strong>: Since Perception covers all senses, it is important to distinguish which of those senses count as observing a creature that is using Stealth. Some senses are more precise than others. Imprecise senses allow a creature to pinpoint the location of another creature, but they don&rsquo;t allow for the use of targeted effects, and attacks against those creatures are subject to miss chances from concealment. A few examples of imprecise senses are hearing, scent, blindsense, and tremorsense. A sense is precise if it allows the creature to use targeted effects on creatures and objects it senses, and to attack enemies without suffering a miss chance from concealment.</p>\n<p>This includes vision, touch, blindsight, and lifesense. Precise senses allow the creature to pinpoint an enemy&rsquo;s location. When a creature uses a precise sense to observe an enemy, that enemy is unable to use Stealth against the observer unless it creates a distraction first, or has a special ability allowing it to do so. Senses other than the listed ones count as precise or imprecise at the GM&rsquo;s discretion. A creature might have a limited form of a sense that makes it too weak to count as precise, such as a beast with primitive eyes that has difficulty seeing a creature that isn&rsquo;t moving.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Cover and Concealment for Stealth</strong>: The reason a character usually needs cover or concealment to use Stealth is tied to the fact that characters can&rsquo;t use Stealth while being observed. A sneaking character needs to avoid all of an opponent&rsquo;s precise senses in order to use Stealth, and for most creatures, that means vision. Effects such as blur and displacement, which leave a clear visual of the character within the perceiving character&rsquo;s vision, aren&rsquo;t sufficient to use Stealth, but a shadowy area or a curtain work nicely, for example. The hide in plain sight class ability allows a creature to use Stealth while being observed and thus avoids this whole situation. As the Core Rulebook mentions, a sneaking character can come out of cover or concealment during her turn, as long as she doesn&rsquo;t end her turn where other characters are directly observing her.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>States of Awareness</strong>: In general, there are four states of awareness that a creature can have with regard to another creature using Stealth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Unaware</strong>: On one end of the spectrum, a sneaking creature can succeed at Stealth well enough that the other creature isn&rsquo;t even aware that the creature is present. This state allows the sneaking creature to use abilities such as the vigilante&rsquo;s startling appearance. The Stealth skill description in the Core Rulebook says that perceiving creatures that fail to beat a sneaking character&rsquo;s Stealth check result are not aware of the sneaking character, but that is different from being totally unaware. This is also true of a creature that has previously been made aware of the creature&rsquo;s presence or location (see below) but is currently unable to observe the sneaking creature. In those cases, the sneaking creature can&rsquo;t use abilities such as startling presence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Aware of Presence</strong>: The next state is when the perceiving creature is aware of the sneaking creature&rsquo;s presence, though not of anything beyond that. This is the state that happens when an invisible creature attacks someone and then successfully uses Stealth so the perceiving creature doesn&rsquo;t know where the attacker moved, or when a sniper succeeds at her Stealth check to snipe. A perceiving creature that becomes aware of a hidden creature&rsquo;s presence will still be aware of its presence at least until the danger of the situation continues, if not longer (though memory-altering magic can change this).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Aware of Location</strong>: The next state is awareness of location. This happens when a perceiving character uses an imprecise sense, such as hearing or tremorsense, to discover what square a hidden or invisible creature inhabits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Observing</strong>: The final state is when the perceiving character is able to directly observe the sneaking character with a precise sense, such as vision. This is generally the result when the perceiving character rolls higher on its opposed Perception check than the sneaking character&rsquo;s Stealth result while also having line of sight to the sneaking character and the ability to see through any sort of invisibility or other tricks the sneaking character might be using.</p>"}

The Disguise skill exists to allow characters to conceal their identity and to potentially pose as other characters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Not Always Opposed</strong>: The most important thing to note about the Disguise skill is that characters do not automatically get a Perception check to oppose it. Per the Core Rulebook, an opponent receives a Perception check only if the disguised character is actively drawing attention, if the perceiving character is actively suspicious of everyone, or if the disguised character is attempting to impersonate a particular person that the perceiving character recognizes. Under one of these circumstances, a perceiving character can attempt one Perception check right away and then another check each hour.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>A Single Disguise Check</strong>: Unlike most other skills, a character typically attempts a Disguise check only once when creating a physical disguise. Further Disguise checks might be necessary for things such as altering one&rsquo;s voice or using appropriate mannerisms or phrasing, but the basic disguise doesn&rsquo;t require further checks. The check result is supposed to be a secret that is revealed only the first time the disguise is truly tested, which can be tricky in the face of disguising characters who want their friends to tell them how good the disguise is. One way to handle this is to roll the Disguise check secretly only the first time it truly comes into opposition (see above), since the skill doesn&rsquo;t indicate when the check first occurs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Disguise Is More Than Visual</strong>: Though the skill as presented in the Core Rulebook focuses on the visual aspects of disguise that a character prepares, later rules (such as the vocal alteration spell) have made it clear that there are other aspects, including voice, mannerisms, and phrasing. The trick is to distinguish between the use of the Bluff and the Disguise skills. Generally, Bluff checks cover telling actual lies to support a disguise, whereas Disguise checks cover the other aspects, such as imitating mannerisms and speech.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Saw Through the Illusion</strong>: It is very tempting to use illusion or transmutation magic to augment a disguise, since the bonus is so high. As per the Core Rulebook, magic that penetrates an illusion or transmutation doesn&rsquo;t automatically see through a mundane disguise, but it negates the magical components of the costume. Thus, a true master of disguise uses both types of trickery, and she also ensures that the person who notices her use of magic has a way to explain the fact that disguise magic was involved at all. For instance, a rogue might disguise herself as a noble with mundane means and then use disguise self to cloak herself in a glamer of that same noble, but more beautiful. Then, if someone sees through the illusion but not the mundane disguise, he would just think she was a vain noble instead of becoming suspicious due to the use of illusion magic and demanding a more thorough inspection.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Simulacrum and Disguise</strong>: The caster of the simulacrum spell uses the Disguise skill to shape the form created. However, it is important to note that the Sense Motive check to detect a simulacrum is very easy at the level that simulacrum becomes available, so unless the simulacrum has a high Bluff modifier, it is still challenging to use a simulacrum as an impostor for long.</p>"}

There are two main types of spellblight areas. In areas of minor spellblight, each time a spellcaster casts a spell, she must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw or be affected by a random minor spellblight. In areas of major spellblight, the caster must succeed at a DC 22 saving throw or contract a major spellblight. Due to the strange and random nature of such areas, their effects are not always consistent.

Bestow curse can bestow any minor spellblight, while a major curse is required to afflict a spellcaster with a major spellblight. Other spells may inflict a specific spellblight or may allow the caster to select any spellblight as part of the spell.

Controlling Companions, Familiars, and Followers}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Animal Archives</em></p>\n<p>As a player, you may desire a special familiar&mdash;either real, unique to your campaign world, or wholly imagined&mdash;that hasn&rsquo;t yet been presented with specific stats. With your Gamemaster&rsquo;s approval, however, it&rsquo;s easy to &ldquo;re-skin&rdquo; an existing familiar stat block to create the exact familiar you want.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The easiest way is to examine the Familiars and Special Abilities table and try to find the animal most similar to the one in your imagination, then use the source listed in the Statistics column to find its full stat block. For many animals, you&rsquo;ll be able to simply use that stat block for your familiar, in the same way that a parrot uses the same stats as a raven, and change only the flavor and descriptions. This way, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about tweaking the creature&rsquo;s mechanics, and your GM can rest easy knowing that the familiar is still balanced.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, you may want an animal radically different from any on this list. In these cases, your best bet is to look at existing creatures until you find something similar to what you&rsquo;re looking for&mdash;preferably of a low Challenge Rating. From there, you can change the skills and feats, add or subtract attacks, and otherwise sculpt the creature until it matches the picture in your imagination. Bear in mind that monster design is a complicated process. You&rsquo;ll need to be familiar with the rules if you want your creature to be balanced, and even if you do the math perfectly, your GM may still decide the creature is too powerful. After all, familiars are intended to be relatively weak, and even a baby mastodon is going to be hard to reduce to an appropriate CR without designing a totally new monster, at which point you might as well just grab the pig familiar stats and add fur. The young template is also extremely useful in reducing creatures&rsquo; CRs. Once you&rsquo;ve got the stats worked out, use the examples above to decide what ability your familiar grants its new master. And don&rsquo;t forget to get your GM&rsquo;s approval!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you want to create a cardinal, because you think he&rsquo;d go well with your fire wizard who only wears red. Since they&rsquo;re both small birds, it&rsquo;s easy enough to take the raven stat block above and simply remove the ability to talk. If you want a lobster, you can use the king crab, perhaps reversing its land and swim speeds to represent its quick movement underwater. A rat makes a fine guinea pig, and a weasel makes a great stoat or ermine. If you want to tinker further, remember that the further you range from an existing stat block&mdash;especially if it&rsquo;s to add extra attacks or otherwise improve a creature&mdash;the more likely your GM is to reject it as being unbalanced. The rules try to balance familiars so that none are obviously better than the others; if yours is clearly better, it&rsquo;s probably too powerful, and perhaps better suited for the animal companion class feature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Approximating Familiars (FF)</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Familiar Folio</em></p>\n<p>While there are already many kinds of familiars, sometimes the available options don&rsquo;t quite fit your vision of your character&rsquo;s magical companion. With your Gamemaster&rsquo;s approval, though, the statistics of an existing familiar can be repurposed to approximate the perfect familiar for your character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Simple Method</h2>\n<p>The easiest way to formulate a familiar when there aren&rsquo;t already stats for the creature you&rsquo;re looking for is to examine the list and find the animal closest to the one you have in mind. You can then simply use the statistics of the existing animal as those for your desired familiar. This ensures that the familiar is balanced, and it doesn&rsquo;t require you or the GM to tinker with the animal&rsquo;s statistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When approximating familiars, the most important thing to realize is that a given familiar&rsquo;s statistics can be used to represent a wide variety of other creatures of the same creature type, not just that species. For example, the rat is a small, agile mammal, so it&rsquo;s a reasonable leap to use its statistics to represent a mouse, shrew, or other similar small mammal. Conversely, using the stats for a bat to represent a flying fish, despite some similarities, is probably suboptimal. Consider some of the Advanced Method options for making more significant adjustments to a creature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Approximate Familiars chart provides a list of the animal familiars most suitable for approximating other types of creatures, suggestions on what those creatures might be, and the sources of the statistics for the base animals. The suggestions listed beside each entry are not exhaustive, of course; they are merely there as guidelines to help you devise the perfect familiar for your character.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Advanced Method</h2>\n<p>You may want a familiar that is radically different from any other creature on the list. In these cases, your best bet is to select the familiar creature that is closest to what you&rsquo;re looking for, then work with your GM to come up with suitable ability substitutions or statistical alterations that bring the statistics in line with your imagined familiar. (Remember, always ask for your GM&rsquo;s approval before altering creature statistics or using homebrew elements in the game!)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need to be well versed in the rules to create a balanced creature, and even if you do the math perfectly, your GM may still decide the creature is too powerful.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Generally, the less dramatic the change to your familiar&rsquo;s base creature, the more balanced the resulting familiar will be. Players should always have a concrete theme in mind before adjusting familiars&rsquo; statistics, preferably a concept that aims toward creating a familiar of an existing type that has a slightly specialized skill set. Creatures that are unique, though still largely natural, and tie into a character&rsquo;s backstory can also make good concepts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Players who are considering altering a pre-existing familiar should consider one or more of the following changes to the familiar&rsquo;s statistics, which are ordered from least to most impactful to the game mechanics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Reverse-calculating where skill ranks went is generally easier with familiars than with other creatures, since familiars rarely have more than 1 Hit Die, and rarely have more than 1 or 2 skill ranks to begin with. Reallocating skill ranks can be an easy way of customizing a creature&rsquo;s statistics to better fit your image of your familiar&rsquo;s personality. For instance, to create a primate familiar that is good at stealing small trinkets, you might start with the statistics of a monkey and simply reallocate its skill ranks from Perception to Sleight of Hand or Stealth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Feats</strong>: You can easily exchange a pre-built familiar&rsquo;s starting feats with different feats that better match your concept, such as the familiar feats. There are also new feats relating to familiars, allowing a great deal of customization and sometimes adding unusual mystical qualities and abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks</strong>: While changing the damage dice for a creature&rsquo;s attacks can quickly create an underwhelming or overpowered familiar, exchanging natural attacks for other types of natural attacks is generally a safe practice. Using the natural attacks table, you can easily switch out a bat&rsquo;s bite attack for two claws or a gore attack. Generally, you should replace a primary natural attack with another primary natural attack, and secondary attacks with other secondary attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong>: Changing a creature&rsquo;s movement types or speeds is usually to be avoided. However, it can be relatively safe as long as you are exchanging an unusual movement speed (such as a 10-foot burrow speed) for a different unusual movement speed of an equal rate (such as a 10-foot climb speed), or you are drastically reducing the creature&rsquo;s base land speed to give it an unusual movement speed (such as reducing a creature&rsquo;s 40-foot base land speed to 10 feet and granting the creature a 30- foot swim speed).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Scores</strong>: Altering a creature&rsquo;s ability scores is the surest way to accidentally create an unbalanced creature, and isn&rsquo;t recommended for approximating new familiars in this manner.</p>"}

To some, it is a means to an end, a regrettable necessity when all other options have failed, and a tool that is to be set down the moment it&rsquo;s not absolutely needed. To others, it is a panacea and a way of life&mdash;a means of solving any problem, and of proving one&rsquo;s worth by standing tall against one&rsquo;s fellows and the harsh denizens of an uncaring universe. In the hands of a skilled warrior, a sword is no longer simply a sharpened length of steel, and even a club is more than just a broken branch. These objects become instruments of a serious and sometimes brutal art, one whose practitioners are every bit as skilled in their artistry as the greatest bards. Many such acolytes of battle might say that theirs is the only art worth pursuing, as it&rsquo;s the sole one by which the artist not only inspires respect, but commands it. Combat is civilization&rsquo;s oldest trade and form of expression, and no matter how far we&rsquo;ve come since the first days of stones and sticks, it continues to shape the events that define us. A civilized society may claim to abhor bloodshed, but it&rsquo;s that same bloodshed&mdash;or its threat&mdash;that watches over us and gives us the freedom to maintain such ideals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook presents a robust system capable of simulating most combat, as well as a wide selection of weapons and armor types common to most European-influenced fantasy settings, this chapter provides new options for GMs and players alike to add depth to the standard combat rules, as well as introduces a wealth of new weapons with historical ties to those lands that would have seemed strange and exotic to residents of Medieval Europe.</p>"}

Affecting the Crowd's Attitude}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 153</em></p>\n<p>When creating a performance combat, it is important to determine the goals and rules of that combat. The following are the major examples of performance combat, but you should feel free to mix and match some of these general categories to create a performance combat that fits the story of your campaign.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Knockout Bout</h2>\n<p>Frequently as brutal but not as bloody as battles to the death, a knockout bout does not end in the death of one side, but still requires a clear and crushing victory. As long as both sides in the performance combat remain standing, the fight continues. Many knockout bout combats require that their participants deal nonlethal damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Staged Combats</h2>\n<p>Staged combats are less dangerous than knockout bouts. In these contests, combatants typically arrange to have blows that just barely land, so the hits are not registered as either nonlethal or lethal damage, but crowd reaction is determined in the same way as for normal battles. Staged combats often require advanced training (see the Stage Combatant feat). Those without advanced training can attempt to participate, but take a &ndash;6 penalty on attack rolls in order to make it seem like their attacks hit without doing real damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>To a Number of Wounds</h2>\n<p>Not all blood sports end in death. It is often costly to train warriors for arenas big and small, and those who finance such enterprises are protective of their investments. In societies that value life but still love the spectacle of a good fracas, fighting to a number of wounds is an excellent compromise. A fight to first blood or to a certain number of wounds is often enough to appease a crowd.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>To the Death</h2>\n<p>Only the death of one side ends these bouts. Sometimes the crowd&rsquo;s reaction is secondary to the desperate battle on display, but other times the crowd&rsquo;s reaction can have an effect on the actual outcome of the fight. Some blood sports demand that combatants hold off on the killing blow until the crowd gets a chance to voice its pleasure or displeasure, usually with a roar of applause or with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down gesture. A thumbs-up gesture allows the vanquished combatant to live and fight another day; a thumbs-down gesture ends the melee with a grotesque spray of blood.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Toward a Goal</h2>\n<p>Often these are elaborate affairs that may reproduce a historical battle, or just pit combatants against terrain and challenges that feature a variety of hazards and traps. These types of battles can be races (maybe mixing them with the rules for vehicular combat presented in Chapter 4), or may present capture-the-flag-like objectives, but all test the ability of the combatants to achieve a predetermined goal.</p>"}

The armor&rsquo;s maximum Dexterity bonus increases by 2, and armor check penalties are reduced by 3. The armor&rsquo;s spell failure chance increases by 20% and applies to all magic cast while wearing the armor, regardless of the magic&rsquo;s source or class abilities possessed by the wearer.

Usually, a certain type of weapon can overcome this reduction (see Overcoming DR). This information is separated from the damage reduction number by a slash. For example, DR 5/magic means that a creature takes 5 less points of damage from all weapons that are not magic. If a dash follows the slash, then the damage reduction is effective against any attack that does not ignore damage reduction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whenever damage reduction completely negates the damage from an attack, it also negates most special effects that accompany the attack, such as injury poison, a monk&rsquo;s stunning, and injury-based disease. Damage reduction does not negate touch attacks, energy damage dealt along with an attack, or energy drains. Nor does it affect poisons or diseases delivered by inhalation, ingestion, or contact.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attacks that deal no damage because of the target&rsquo;s damage reduction do not disrupt spells.</p>\n<p>Spells, spell-like abilities, and energy attacks (even nonmagical fire) ignore damage reduction.</p>\n<p>Sometimes damage reduction represents instant healing. Sometimes it represents the creature&rsquo;s tough hide or body. In either case, other characters can see that conventional attacks won&rsquo;t work.</p>\n<p>If a creature has damage reduction from more than one source, the two forms of damage reduction do not stack. Instead, the creature gets the benefit of the best damage reduction in a given situation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Overcoming DR</h2>\n<p>Damage reduction may be overcome by special materials, magic weapons (any weapon with a +1 or higher enhancement bonus, not counting the enhancement from masterwork quality), certain types of weapons (such as slashing or bludgeoning), and weapons imbued with an alignment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon (in addition to any alignment it may already have).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Weapons with an enhancement bonus of +3 or greater can ignore some types of damage reduction, regardless of their actual material or alignment. The following table shows what type of enhancement bonus is needed to overcome some common types of damage reduction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 65.4073%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 30.0144%;\" scope=\"col\">DR Type</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.2641%;\" scope=\"col\">Weapon Enhancement Bonus Equivalent</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 30.0144%;\">Cold Iron/Silver</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.2641%;\">+3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 30.0144%;\">Adamantine*</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.2641%;\">+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 30.0144%;\">Alignment-based</td>\n<td style=\"width: 69.2641%;\">+5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>* Note that this does not give the ability to ignore hardness, like an actual adamantine weapon does</p>"}

Introducing Words of Power}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 165</em></p>\n<p>Target words establish the way in which a spell determines its targets. Some effect words restrict the type of target words that can be used in wordspells that contain them. A wordspell contains only one target word. Target words use the following format.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Name</h2>\n<p>This is the name of the target word. It is used as part of the wordspell&rsquo;s complete title.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Level</h2>\n<p>This line lists the minimum level for a wordspell containing this target word.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Range</h2>\n<p>This line describes the range of a wordspell containing this target word.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Target</h2>\n<p>This paragraph describes how a wordspell using this target word determines its targets or area of effect. This could be a selection of targets by the caster or the creation of an area of effect, in which case all the creatures in the area are automatically targets of the spell. It might also create an effect that has no specific targets, instead just causing the effect word to occupy the listed space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Boost</h2>\n<p>If the target word can be boosted by the boost meta word, the effects are listed here. See the meta word section for more details.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Personal</h2>\n<p>Level 0</p>\n<p>Range no range</p>\n<p>A wordspell with this target word only affects the caster. Effect words that are restricted to this word can be combined with other effect words, but the caster is the only target, regardless of other target possibilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Selected</h2>\n<p>Level 0</p>\n<p>Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p>A wordspell with this target word affects a single target within range. If the wordspell deals energy damage, this word creates a ray that requires a ranged touch attack to hit, or it can be used as a melee touch attack with no range (decided by the wordcaster when the wordspell is cast). If it is used as a melee touch attack and the attack misses, the wordcaster can hold the charge and try again with subsequent attacks.</p>\n<p>Boost: Instead of one target, the wordspell affects up to one target per caster level, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. The range increases to medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level). If used with an effect word that deals energy damage, the wordcaster must make multiple ray attacks for each target (they cannot be made as melee touch attacks). This boosted target word increases the level of all the effect words in the spell by 3 levels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Barrier</h2>\n<p>Level 3</p>\n<p>Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p>A wordspell with this target word creates a visible barrier that is 10 feet long per caster level and 10 feet high. Creatures touching or passing through the barrier are subject to the spell&rsquo;s effect. The barrier does not hinder creatures passing through it unless noted in the spell effect. Creatures occupying the space of the barrier when it forms are subject to the spell&rsquo;s effect. The wall is 1 foot wide and must be anchored on a solid surface. The wall must be straight when formed.</p>\n<p>Boost: The wall is 20 feet long per caster level and up to 20 feet high. The wall can take on any shape desired by the caster, but it must remain a vertical surface.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Burst</h2>\n<p>Level 1</p>\n<p>Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)</p>\n<p>A wordspell with this target word affects everything it catches in a 10-foot-radius burst. Some effect words that use the burst target word are instead emanations, taking up the same area as the burst. These effect words typically have a longer duration and cannot be moved once created. They are noted by the word &ldquo;emanation&rdquo; in parentheses after the burst target restriction.</p>\n<p>Boost: The spell affects everything in a 20-foot-radius burst. Its range increases to medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level). Boosting this target word increases its level by 2.</p>\n<p>Boost: The spell affects everything in a 40-foot-radius burst. Its range increases to long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level). Boosting this target word increases its level by 4.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cone</h2>\n<p>Level 0</p>\n<p>Range 10 ft.</p>\n<p>A wordspell with this target word affects everything in a cone-shaped burst.</p>\n<p>Boost: The range increases to 20 feet. Boosting this target word increases its level by 2.</p>\n<p>Boost: The range increases to 40 feet. Boosting this target word increases its level by 4.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Line</h2>\n<p>Level 1</p>\n<p>Range 20 ft.</p>\n<p>A wordspells with this target word affects everything in a 20- foot line.</p>\n<p>Boost: The range increases to 60 feet. Boosting this target word increases its level by 1.</p>\n<p>Boost: The range increases to 120 feet. Boosting this target word increases its level by 2.</p>"}

Outsider Categories}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 102</em></p>\n<p>All outsiders love that which makes them strong. They seek to promote those qualities that offer them the greatest power, and covet their own survival. As beings&mdash;some might even call them concepts&mdash;of thought, will, and power, outsiders reward those who help them make their core concepts immortal.</p>\n<p>In short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aeons are dedicated to their often obscure and contradictory goals.</li>\n<li>Agathions love the defense of good without regard for law and chaos.</li>\n<li>Angels love beauty and things that destroy evil.</li>\n<li>Archons love pure souls and order.</li>\n<li>Azatas love beauty and freedom.</li>\n<li>Daemons love death and oblivion.</li>\n<li>Demons love suffering.</li>\n<li>Devils love souls of any sort.</li>\n<li>Elementals love power.</li>\n<li>Inevitables and axiomites hate chaos and are focused on their goals.</li>\n<li>Proteans love chaos and want to return the multiverse to its original chaotic state.</li>\n<li>Qlippoth hate all intelligent life, as it is the engine of sin, and want it destroyed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reward outsiders offer may be actual aid, grudging service, or even just agreeing not to devour the binder&rsquo;s soul. Regardless, it is always&mdash;always&mdash;in the binder&rsquo;s best interest to make the summoning as painless as possible for the target, or else to overawe the summoned creature with the threat of utter destruction or millennia of endless pain. Attempting to treat outsiders as equals and the pact as a mere negotiating tool almost always ends in disaster. More specifics for each type of outsider are described below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Offering appropriate gifts to the summoned creature can provide the caster a +2 bonus on the opposed Charisma check to keep it on the Material Plane. Indeed, if the gift is sweet enough, the outsider may choose not to break the strictures of the summoning, even if it has the opportunity to do so. All gifts, whether or not they are good enough to please the outsider, disappear at the spell&rsquo;s conclusion. Only the worst sorts of gifts are rejected; such a rejection indicates that the summoned creature feels gravely insulted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Anathematic Substances</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 102</em></p>\n<p>All outsiders have vulnerabilities, and those who deal with them must know what these vulnerabilities are. Some binders even use weapons composed of anathematic substances to create or draw their magic circles, or may even grind such valuable weapons up to create the powder to make the circles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For every 5,000 gp of an anathematic substance used, the caster gains a +1 bonus on the opposed Charisma check to bargain with the outsider. This destroys the substance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Anarchic</h2>\n<p>Infused with the power of chaos, anarchic weapons are anathema to many lawful outsiders, even those who are not specifically vulnerable to the weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Axiomatic</h2>\n<p>Empowered by law, axiomatic weapons are harmful to chaotic outsiders, dealing extra damage even if the outsider is not particularly vulnerable to its effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alchemical Silver</h2>\n<p>While a weapon made of alchemical silver reduces damage by 1, with a minimum of 1 point of damage, it may be more effective than other weapons against certain outsiders. It has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 8.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cold Iron</h2>\n<p>Effective against daemons, demons, and fey, cold iron has been drawn from deep beneath forbidding mountains and forged with the least heat possible. Because of the delicacy and difficulty of the process, a weapon made of cold iron costs twice as much to make, and every magical enhancement increases its price significantly. It has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Holy</h2>\n<p>A holy weapon is any weapon imbued with holy power, which allows it to bypass damage reduction for specific evil creatures and inflict an additional 2d6 points of damage on those monsters. Evil outsiders that do not have a specific vulnerability to holy weapons still take that additional damage if the weapon overcomes the creature&rsquo;s damage reduction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mithral</h2>\n<p>Most outsiders react to mithral in the same way that they do to actual silver.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Silver</h2>\n<p>Long revered for its purity and ability to harm lycanthropes and devils, silver is also used to trap certain kinds of good outsiders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Unholy</h2>\n<p>The opposite of the holy weapon, an unholy weapon inflicts its damage on good-aligned outsiders, but is in other respects the same.</p>"}

A monk, a character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, a spellcaster delivering a touch attack spell, and a creature with natural physical weapons all count as being armed (see natural attacks).</p>\n<p>Note that being armed counts for both offense and defense (the character can make attacks of opportunity).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Unarmed Strike Damage</h2>\n<p>An unarmed strike from a Medium character deals 1d3 points of bludgeoning damage (plus your Strength modifier, as normal). A Small character's unarmed strike deals 1d2 points of bludgeoning damage, while a Large character's unarmed strike deals 1d4 points of bludgeoning damage. All damage from unarmed strikes is nonlethal damage. Unarmed strikes count as light weapons (for purposes of two-weapon attack penalties and so on).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dealing Lethal Damage</h2>\n<p>You can specify that your unarmed strike will deal lethal damage before you make your attack roll, but you take a &ndash;4 penalty on your attack roll. If you have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, you can deal lethal damage with an unarmed strike without taking a penalty on the attack roll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ranged Attacks</h2>\n<p>With a ranged weapon, you can shoot or throw at any target that is within the weapon's maximum range and in line of sight. The maximum range for a thrown weapon is five range increments. For projectile weapons, it is 10 range increments. Some ranged weapons have shorter maximum ranges, as specified in their descriptions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Natural Attacks</h2>\n<p>Attacks made with natural weapons, such as claws and bites, are melee attacks that can be made against any creature within your reach (usually 5 feet). These attacks are made using your full attack bonus and deal an amount of damage that depends on their type (plus your Strength modifier, as normal). You do not receive additional natural attacks for a high base attack bonus. Instead, you receive additional attack rolls for multiple limb and body parts capable of making the attack (as noted by the race or ability that grants the attacks). If you possess only one natural attack (such as a bite&mdash;two claw attacks do not qualify), you add 1&ndash;1/2 times your Strength bonus on damage rolls made with that attack.</p>\n<p>Some natural attacks are denoted as secondary natural attacks, such as tails and wings. Attacks with secondary natural attacks are made using your base attack bonus minus 5. These attacks deal an amount of damage depending on their type, but you only add half your Strength modifier on damage rolls.</p>\n<p>You can make attacks with natural weapons in combination with attacks made with a melee weapon and unarmed strikes, so long as a different limb is used for each attack. For example, you cannot make a claw attack and also use that hand to make attacks with a longsword. When you make additional attacks in this way, all of your natural attacks are treated as secondary natural attacks, using your base attack bonus minus 5 and adding only 1/2 of your Strength modif ier on damage rolls. Feats such as Two-Weapon Fighting and Multiattack can reduce these penalties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Multiple Attacks</h2>\n<p>A character who can make more than one attack per round must use the full-attack action(see @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.q5bgNObausAXw2UA]{2.02.3. Full-Round Actions}) in order to get more than one attack.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shooting or Throwing into a Melee</h2>\n<p>If you shoot or throw a ranged weapon at a target engaged in melee with a friendly character, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on your attack roll. Two characters are engaged in melee if they are enemies of each other and either threatens the other. (An unconscious or otherwise immobilized character is not considered engaged unless he is actually being attacked.) If your target (or the part of your target you're aiming at, if it's a big target) is at least 10 feet away from the nearest friendly character, you can avoid the &ndash;4 penalty, even if the creature you're aiming at is engaged in melee with a friendly character.</p>\n<p>If your target is two size categories larger than the friendly characters it is engaged with, this penalty is reduced to &ndash;2. There is no penalty for firing at a creature that is three size categories larger than the friendly characters it is engaged with.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Precise Shot</h2>\n<p>If you have the Precise Shot feat, you don't take this penalty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fighting Defensively as a Standard Action</h2>\n<p>You can choose to fight defensively when attacking. If you do so, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Critical Hits</h2>\n<p>When you make an attack roll and get a natural 20 (the d20 shows 20), you hit regardless of your target's Armor Class, and you have scored a &ldquo;threat,&rdquo; meaning the hit might be a critical hit (or &ldquo;crit&rdquo;). To find out if it's a critical hit, you immediately make an attempt to &ldquo;confirm&rdquo; the critical hit&mdash;another attack roll with all the same modifiers as the attack roll you just made. If the confirmation roll also results in a hit against the target's AC, your original hit is a critical hit. (The critical roll just needs to hit to give you a crit, it doesn't need to come up 20 again.) If the confirmation roll is a miss, then your hit is just a regular hit.</p>\n<p>A critical hit means that you roll your damage more than once, with all your usual bonuses, and add the rolls together. Unless otherwise specified, the threat range for a critical hit on an attack roll is 20, and the multiplier is &times;2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Exception</h2>\n<p>Precision damage (such as from a rogue's sneak attack class feature) and additional damage dice from weapon special abilities (such as flaming) are not multiplied when you score a critical hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Increased Threat Range</h2>\n<p>Sometimes your threat range is greater than 20. That is, you can score a threat on a lower number. In such cases, a roll of lower than 20 is not an automatic hit. Any attack roll that doesn't result in a hit is not a threat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Increased Critical Multiplier</h2>\n<p>Some weapons deal better than double damage on a critical hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spells and Critical Hits</h2>\n<p>A spell that requires an attack roll can score a critical hit. A spell attack that requires no attack roll cannot score a critical hit. If a spell causes @Compendium[pf-content.pf-universal-monster-rules.p2ZbD5K5moOT6sda]{Ability Damage or Drain}, the damage or drain is doubled on a critical hit.</p>"}

The &ldquo;size&rdquo; of the Material Plane depends upon the campaign&mdash;it might conform only to the single world on which your game is set, or it might encompass an entire universe of planets, moons, stars, and galaxies. The Material Plane is the default plane for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Planar Traits</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>GameMastery Guide pg. 188</em></p>\n<p>The Material Plane is the center of most cosmologies and defines what is considered normal.

Souls manifest here in the shell of a physical body, a union so complete that most living creatures do not spend much time contemplating the difference between the gross physical form and the higher monadic soul that guides its movements and destiny. The final destination of a soul is not yet determined during its mortal life, making the Material Plane a magnet for the attentions of gods and outsiders eager to rally mortals to their banners in the afterlife, either willingly or by force. A planar crossroads, the Material Plane is coexistent with the Ethereal and Shadow Planes and coterminous with all of the realms of the Inner Sphere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just as little-known forces bind a physical body to its astral and ethereal counterparts, the whole of the universe is bound together by a series of ley lines&mdash; spiritual conduits that interpenetrate the many planes of the multiverse. Ley lines are prevalent on the Material Plane, and wise adepts of the occult arts, canny students of the arcane, and even village witches learn to recognize and manipulate these forces to their own ends. Some believe that one of the most prominent of these ley lines is the so-called &ldquo;River of Souls&rdquo; that guides a monad&rsquo;s spiritual journey through mortal incarnation and the afterlife, but that is just one aspect of this multiversal arterial network.</p>"}

No one is exactly sure why they grow to be giants among their kind, but it&rsquo;s probably due to a combination of luck, diet, and constant access to food. These goblins are monsters among their own kind, not just in height, but also in girth and in strength. If not cast out for eating all of the tribe&rsquo;s food, oversized goblins often become the bosses of their tribes, and the most powerful of them become chiefs.<br /><br />Oversized goblins are Medium size, and grow to 4 to 5 feet tall. They tend to be particularly obese, weighing between 225 and 275 pounds.

Farms are common in settled areas, while grasslands represent untamed plains. The battlefields where large armies clash are temporary places, usually reclaimed by natural vegetation or the farmer&rsquo;s plow. Battlefields represent a third terrain category because adventurers tend to spend a lot of time there, not because they&rsquo;re particularly prevalent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The table below shows the proportions of terrain elements in the different categories of plains. On a farm, light undergrowth represents most mature grain crops, so farms growing vegetable crops will have less light undergrowth, as will all farms during the time between harvest and a few months after planting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The terrain elements in the table below are mutually exclusive.</p>\n<hr />\n<table style=\"width: 74.7969%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 98.7084%;\" colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\">Plains Category</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 41.5129%;\" scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.0331%;\" scope=\"col\">Farm</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 20.2842%;\" scope=\"col\">Grasslands</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 22.8782%;\" scope=\"col\">Battlefield</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 41.5129%;\">Light undergrowth</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.0331%;\">40%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 20.2842%;\">20%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 22.8782%;\">10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 41.5129%;\">Heavy undergrowth</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.0331%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 20.2842%;\">10%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 22.8782%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 41.5129%;\">Light rubble</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.0331%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 20.2842%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 22.8782%;\">10%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 41.5129%;\">Trench</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.0331%;\">5%</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 20.2842%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 22.8782%;\">5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 41.5129%;\">Berm</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.0331%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 20.2842%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 22.8782%;\">5%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<h2>Undergrowth</h2>\n<p>Whether they&rsquo;re crops or natural vegetation, the tall grasses of the plains function like light undergrowth in a forest. Particularly thick bushes form patches of heavy undergrowth that dot the landscape in grasslands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Light Rubble</h2>\n<p>On the battlefield, light rubble usually represents something that was destroyed: the ruins of a building or the scattered remnants of a stone wall, for example. It functions as described in the @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.3YyU7Yg6wbShgOKM]{3.2.6. Desert Terrain} section.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Trench</h2>\n<p>Often dug before a battle to protect soldiers, a trench functions as a low wall, except that it provides no cover against adjacent foes. It costs 2 squares of movement to leave a trench, but it costs nothing extra to enter one. Creatures outside a trench who make a melee attack against a creature inside the trench gain a +1 bonus on melee attacks because they have higher ground. In farm terrain, trenches are generally irrigation ditches.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Berm</h2>\n<p>A common defensive structure, a berm is a low, earthen wall that slows movement and provides a measure of cover. Put a berm on the map by drawing two adjacent rows of steep slope (described in @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.RVKULXygOAXTZ1WC]{3.2.4. Hills Terrain}), with the edges of the berm on the downhill side. Thus, a character crossing a 2-square berm will travel uphill for 1 square, then downhill for 1 square. Two square berms provide cover as low walls for anyone standing behind them. Larger berms provide the low wall benefit for anyone standing 1 square downhill from the top of the berm.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fences</h2>\n<p>Wooden fences are generally used to contain livestock or impede oncoming soldiers. It costs an extra square of movement to cross a wooden fence. A stone fence provides a measure of cover as well, functioning as low walls. Mounted characters can cross a fence without slowing their movement if they succeed on a DC 15 Ride check. If the check fails, the steed crosses the fence, but the rider falls out of the saddle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Other Plains Terrain Features</h2>\n<p>Occasional trees dot the landscape in many plains, although on battlefields they&rsquo;re often felled to provide raw material for siege engines (described in @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.a0xDSVGQRE2pVzkA]{3.3.2. Urban Features}). Hedgerows (described in Marsh Terrain) are found in plains as well. Streams, generally 5 to 20 feet wide and 5 to 10 feet deep, are commonplace.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stealth and Detection in Plains</h2>\n<p>In plains terrain, the maximum distance at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 6d6 &times; 40 feet, although the specifics of your map might restrict line of sight. Cover and concealment are not uncommon, so a good place of refuge is often nearby, if not right at hand.</p>"}

Aquatic Terrain}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 424</em></p>\n<p>There are many ways to get lost in the wilderness. Following an obvious road, trail, or feature such as a stream or shoreline prevents most from becoming lost, but travelers striking off cross-country might become disoriented&mdash;especially in conditions of poor visibility or in difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Poor Visibility</h2>\n<p>Anytime characters cannot see at least 60 feet due to reduced visibility conditions, they might become lost. Characters traveling through fog, snow, or a downpour might easily lose the ability to see any landmarks not in their immediate vicinity. Similarly, characters traveling at night might be at risk, too, depending on the quality of their light sources, the amount of moonlight, and whether they have darkvision or low-light vision.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Difficult Terrain</h2>\n<p>Any character in forest, moor, hill, or mountain terrain might become lost if he moves away from a trail, road, stream, or other obvious path or track. Forests are especially dangerous because they obscure far-off landmarks and make it hard to see the sun or stars.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Chance to Get Lost</h2>\n<p>If conditions exist that make getting lost a possibility, the character leading the way must succeed on a Survival check or become lost.

In the case of a party moving together, only the character leading the way makes the check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Effects of Being Lost</h2>\n<p>If a party becomes lost, it is no longer certain of moving in the direction it intended to travel. Randomly determine the direction in which the party actually travels during each hour of local or overland movement. The characters&rsquo; movement continues to be random until they blunder into a landmark they can&rsquo;t miss, or until they recognize that they are lost and make an effort to regain their bearings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Recognizing You&rsquo;re Lost</h2>\n<p>Once per hour of random travel, each character in the party may attempt a Survival check (DC 20, &ndash;1 per hour of random travel) to recognize that he is no longer certain of his direction of travel. Some circumstances might make it obvious that the characters are lost.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Setting a New Course</h2>\n<p>Determining the correct direction of travel once a party has become lost requires a Survival check (DC 15, +2 per hour of random travel). If a character fails this check, he chooses a random direction as the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; direction for resuming travel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once the characters are traveling along their new course, correct or incorrect, they might get lost again. If the conditions still make it possible for travelers to become lost, check once per hour of travel as described above to see if the party maintains its new course or begins to move at random again.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Conflicting Directions</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible that several characters may attempt to determine the right direction to proceed after becoming lost. Make a Survival check for each character in secret, then tell the players whose characters succeeded the correct direction in which to travel, and tell the players whose characters failed a random direction they think is right, with no indication who is correct.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Regaining Your Bearings</h2>\n<p>There are several ways for characters to find their way after becoming lost. First, if the characters successfully set a new course and follow it to the destination they&rsquo;re trying to reach, they&rsquo;re not lost anymore. Second, the characters, through random movement, might run into an unmistakable landmark. Third, if conditions suddenly improve&mdash; the fog lifts or the sun comes up&mdash;lost characters may attempt to set a new course, as described above, with a +4 bonus on the Survival check.</p>"}

All animal attacks are made using the creature's full base attack bonus unless otherwise noted. Animal attacks add the animal's Strength modifier to the damage roll, unless it is its only attack, in which case it adds 1-1/2 its Strength modifier. Some have special abilities, such as scent.</p>\n<p>See Special Abilities for more information on these abilities.</p>\n<p>As you gain levels, your animal companion improves as well, usually at 4th or 7th level, in addition to the standard bonuses noted on @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.sjhxRhOgV3ynmqf9]{1.7. Animal Companions}. Instead of taking the listed benefit at 4th or 7th level, you can instead choose to increase the companion's Dexterity and Constitution by 2.</p>\n<hr

Blinded creatures can&rsquo;t run or charge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All opponents have total concealment from a blinded creature, so the blinded creature has a 50% miss chance in combat. A blinded creature must first pinpoint the location of an opponent in order to attack the right square; if the blinded creature launches an attack without pinpointing its foe, it attacks a random square within its reach. For ranged attacks or spells against a foe whose location is not pinpointed, roll to determine which adjacent square the blinded creature is facing; its attack is directed at the closest target that lies in that direction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A blinded creature loses its Dexterity modifier to AC (if positive) and takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC.</p>\n<p>A blinded creature takes a &ndash;4 penalty on Perception checks and most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks, including any with an armor check penalty. A creature blinded by darkness automatically fails any skill check relying on vision.</p>\n<p>Creatures blinded by darkness cannot use gaze attacks and are immune to gaze attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A creature blinded by darkness can make a Perception check as a free action each round in order to locate foes (DC equal to opponents&rsquo; Stealth checks). A successful check lets a blinded character hear an unseen creature &ldquo;over there somewhere.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s almost impossible to pinpoint the location of an unseen creature. A Perception check that beats the DC by 20 reveals the unseen creature&rsquo;s square (but the unseen creature still has total concealment from the blinded creature).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A blinded creature can grope about to find unseen creatures. A character can make a touch attack with his hands or a weapon into two adjacent squares using a standard action. If an unseen target is in the designated square, there is a 50% miss chance on the touch attack. If successful, the groping character deals no damage but has pinpointed the unseen creature&rsquo;s current location. If the unseen creature moves, its location is once again unknown.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a blinded creature is struck by an unseen foe, the blinded character pinpoints the location of the creature that struck him (until the unseen creature moves, of course). The only exception is if the unseen creature has a reach greater than 5 feet (in which case the blinded character knows the location of the unseen opponent, but has not pinpointed him) or uses a ranged attack (in which case the blinded character knows the general direction of the foe, but not his location).</p>\n<p>A creature with the scent ability automatically pinpoints unseen creatures within 5 feet of its location.</p>"}

Use the following rules to determine those statistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alchemical Engine</h2>\n<p>Harvesting the power of steam or some other alchemical reaction, these engines are typically reinforced and difficult to destroy. They can be disabled, and are considered either difficult or extreme devices based on the complexity of the device.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Creature</h2>\n<p>A creature used as propulsion uses its own statistics. During movement and the effects of any combat maneuver, pulling creatures&rsquo; spaces are considered vehicle spaces to determine the effects of vehicle maneuvers. Creatures pulling a vehicle can be arranged in teams. This means two creatures of the same type and same size can occupy the same space to pull a vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dirigible</h2>\n<p>Lighter-than-air alchemical gases can be harnessed to give a vehicle flight. Dirigibles are often easier to destroy than the vehicle they convey. Dirigibles have 5 hit points per square and no hardness. They take double the normal damage from acid, electricity, and fire attacks (multiply the damage roll by 2).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Item</h2>\n<p>Like a creature, a magic item uses its own item statistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sails</h2>\n<p>Used on magically or alchemically powered airships and on any fast-moving water vehicle, sails are often weaker than the vessels they propel, though they are relatively easy to repair. Taking out the sails is a good way to capture a vessel. Sails have 5 hit points per square and no hardness. They take double the normal damage from acid and fire attacks (multiply the damage roll by 2). While the sails have rigging, such rigging manipulated by the crew, and as such are not considered driving devices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 47.1862%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 44.297%;\" scope=\"col\">Material</td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.2473%; text-align: center;\" scope=\"col\">Hit Points per Square</td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.1562%; text-align: center;\" scope=\"col\">Hardness</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 44.297%;\">Sails</td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.2473%; text-align: center;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.1562%; text-align: center;\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 44.297%;\">Dirigible</td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.2473%; text-align: center;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.1562%; text-align: center;\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 44.297%;\">Alchemical Engine</td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.2473%; text-align: center;\">20</td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.1562%; text-align: center;\">8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 44.297%;\">Magically Treated</td>\n<td style=\"width: 34.2473%; text-align: center;\">x2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.1562%; text-align: center;\">x2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Designing Spells}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 132</em></p>\n<p>Whether or not spell resistance applies to a spell depends mostly on whether or not it is an instantaneous or ongoing magical effect. Spell resistance applies to instantaneous magical effects (such as fireball) and ongoing magical effects (such as wall of fire), but not to nonmagical effects or spells that create nonmagical effects, whether instantaneous or ongoing. For example, wall of stone conjures an instantaneous wall of stone that cannot be dispelled; spell resistance doesn&rsquo;t help you walk through the spell&rsquo;s wall any more than it would if you tried to walk through a mortared stone wall in a castle&mdash;neither wall is magical, and both walls remain there even if you use dispel magic or antimagic field on them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The general rule is that most spells allow spell resistance. Only when you&rsquo;re deliberately designing a spell that creates a nonmagical object or nonmagical effect is spell resistance likely to be irrelevant. You can use move earth (instantaneous duration) to create a hill, and spell resistance won&rsquo;t help you get over or through the hill because the spell moves the earth and thereafter stops being magical; likewise, you can use move earth to create a pit, and spell resistance won&rsquo;t help you ignore the pit because it&rsquo;s a nonmagical pit, just as if you had created it with a shovel. Magic stone adds magical power to stones, but spell resistance doesn&rsquo;t help protect against being hit by the stones any more than spell resistance helps protect against a +1 arrow because the magic is focused on the stones, not on the creature with spell resistance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a common trick to design a spell that doesn&rsquo;t allow spell resistance so the caster can use it against creatures who have spell resistance. In many cases, the idea behind the design is just silly, like a spell that creates a sphere of burning oil and hurls it at the intended area, where it bursts in an explosion of flame; clearly the intent is to create a nonmagical fireball that bypasses spell resistance. Golems in particular are often the intended targets of these spell designs, as their immunity to magic ability makes them completely immune to any effect that allows spell resistance. You should avoid letting these sorts of trick spells into your campaign, as they meddle with the balance of encounters (some monsters are designed to be harder for melee characters to fight, some are designed to be harder for spellcasters to fight, and some are just supposed to be difficult all around).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whether or not a spell allows spell resistance is not an indicator of the spell&rsquo;s power; for most encounters, spell resistance isn&rsquo;t a factor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a spell&rsquo;s saving throw entry is marked as &ldquo;(harmless)&rdquo; or &ldquo;(object),&rdquo; the spell resistance entry should say that as well.</p>"}

Light undergrowth provides concealment and increases the DC of Acrobatics and Stealth checks by 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Other Hills Terrain Elements</h2>\n<p>Trees aren&rsquo;t out of place in hills terrain, and valleys often have active streams (5 to 10 feet wide and no more than 5 feet deep) or dry streambeds (treat as a trench 5 to 10 feet across) in them. If you add a stream or streambed, remember that water always flows downhill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stealth and Detection in Hills</h2>\n<p>In gentle hills, the maximum distance at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 2d10 &times; 10 feet. In rugged hills, this distance is 2d6 &times; 10 feet. Hiding in hills terrain can be difficult if there isn&rsquo;t undergrowth around. A hilltop or ridge provides enough cover to hide from anyone below the hilltop or ridge.</p>"}

While ranged siege engines use most of these entries, close-assault siege engines only use some of them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cost</h2>\n<p>This value is the siege engine&rsquo;s cost in gold pieces (gp). The cost includes gear needed to work the engine as well as gear for upkeep. Typical ammunition costs and weights are given in siege weapon description.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Damage</h2>\n<p>This column gives the damage typically dealt by the engine. If the engine has a special mode of attack or damage, this space is marked by the words &ldquo;see description.&rdquo; If the siege engine does not deal any damage, but rather is a tool for getting close to or over fortifications, this entry features a dash (&mdash;). Some ranged siege engines can be loaded with special ammunition that affects or overrides the weapon&rsquo;s typical damage or range.</p>\n<p>As large and imprecise weapons, siege engines do not deal sneak attack damage or any other kind of precision damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Critical</h2>\n<p>The entry for this column notes how the engine is used with the rules for critical hits. Unlike normal ranged weapons, siege engines can deal critical damage to objects as well as creatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Range</h2>\n<p>Any attack at more than the distance listed in this entry is penalized for range. Beyond this range, the attack or targeting check takes a cumulative &ndash;2 penalty for each full range increment (or fraction thereof ) of distance to the target. Some siege engines have a minimum range for effectiveness. If that is the case, the range of this weapon is followed by a parenthetical with the minimum range, followed by the abbreviation &ldquo;min.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Type</h2>\n<p>Like weapons, siege engines that deal damage are classified according to the type of damage they deal: B for bludgeoning, P for piercing, or S for slashing. Some engines deal damage of multiple types. Some special siege engines (like the firedrake and the firewyrm) deal energy damage, typically fire damage. In those cases, the type of energy damage is listed instead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crew</h2>\n<p>This column gives the number of creatures needed to properly use the siege engine, assuming Medium creatures. Some siege engines can be used with a smaller crew, but there are usually consequences such as slower aiming, firing, or movement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Aim</h2>\n<p>This column gives the number of full-round actions (or move actions if the crew leader has the Master Siege Engineer feat) required to aim a siege engine. If the siege engine is being controlled by less than its normal crew complement, the number of actions it takes for the crew to aim the siege engine is doubled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Load</h2>\n<p>This column gives the number of full-round actions (or move actions if the crew leader has the Master Siege Engineer feat) required to load a siege engine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Speed</h2>\n<p>This is how fast the siege engine can be moved with move actions made by its entire crew.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Ranged Siege Engines</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 159</em></p>\n<p>Ranged siege engines assault structures and people from a distance, by propelling ammunition in some fashion.

Both take a number of actions to load or aim, and the basic rules are described below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Load Ammunition</h2>\n<p>In order for a ranged siege engine to fire, it needs to be loaded with ammunition. Loading ammunition takes a number of full-round actions depending on the siege engine (this time can be reduced to move actions if the crew leader has the Master Siege Engineer feat).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Aiming a Siege Engine</h2>\n<p>Ranged siege engines must be aimed in order to attack a desired target (in the case of direct-fire siege engines) or square (in the case of indirect-fire siege engines). Aiming takes a number of full-round actions (or move actions if the crew leader has the Master Siege Engineer feat), with the number depending on the specific siege engine. Aiming a siege engine with a diminished crew doubles the amount of time it takes to aim the siege engine. Each time a new target or square is chosen as the target of a siege engine&rsquo;s attack, that engine must be aimed anew.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Direct-Fire Ranged Siege Engines</h2>\n<p>Direct-fire weapons launch their projectiles on a relatively flat trajectory, allowing them to more easily target creatures or pummel barriers directly in front of them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A direct-fire weapon uses a normal attack roll, with the normal penalty for nonproficient use. In addition, a direct-fire weapon takes a &ndash;2 attack roll penalty per size category that the weapon is larger than the creature aiming it. Creatures that have ranks in Knowledge (engineering) are not adversely affected by their size when firing direct-fire ranged siege engines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sheer manpower can also reduce the penalties for size. Increasing the crew of these weapons by 1 or more can reduce the attack roll penalty for creature size: as long as an extra crew member is no smaller than three size categories smaller than the direct-fire weapon, it can reduce the penalty due to the aiming creature&rsquo;s size by 2. For example, a Huge ballista fired by a Medium creature that is part of a crew of two (the creature aiming the ballista and someone to help position it) takes only a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Indirect-Fire Ranged Siege Engines</h2>\n<p>Indirect-fire weapons launch projectiles in high arcs toward their targets. They typically lob heavier missiles and payloads than direct-fire weapons, but they are harder to aim accurately. Indirect weapons can bypass many forms of fortification, delivering their payloads of solid shot, scatter shot, or even disease-ridden offal to targets beyond the walls of castles. They can also be used to batter fortifications where they are most vulnerable, arcing down on towers and walls, crushing them with the weight of stone or raining down smaller projectiles on a wall&rsquo;s defenders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Indirect-fire weapons use a targeting mechanic similar to that described for catapults in the Core Rulebook, hereafter referred to as an indirect attack. The following is an update to those rules.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Indirect Attack</h2>\n<p>To fire an indirect-fire ranged siege engine, the crew leader makes a targeting check against the DC of the siege engine. This check uses his base attack bonus, his Intelligence modifier (if not trained in Knowledge [engineering]) or Knowledge (engineering) skill modifier (if trained in that skill), any penalty for not being proficient in the siege engine, and the appropriate modifiers from Table 3&ndash;12. If the check succeeds, the ammunition of the indirect attack hits the square the siege engine was aimed at, dealing the indicated damage or effect to any object or creature within the area of its attack. Creatures may get a saving throw to limit the effect of the attack; this is typically based on the type of ammunition used.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the attack misses the intended square, roll 1d8 to determine in what direction the shot veers. A roll of 1 indicates the ammunition falls short (toward the siege engine), with rolls of 2 through 8 counting squares clockwise around the target square. Roll 1d4 for every range increment at which the attack was made (1d4 if the target square is within the engine&rsquo;s first range increment, 2d4 if the target square is within the second range increment, and so on). The total is the number of squares by which the attack misses, with the direction in which the squares are counted determined by the d8 roll. The ammunition deals its damage and any other effects in the square it lands on.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 97.8065%; height: 114px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 66.7546%; height: 16px;\">Condition</td>\n<td style=\"width: 32.5858%; height: 16px;\">Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 66.7546%; height: 16px;\">No line of sight to target square</td>\n<td style=\"width: 32.5858%; height: 16px;\">-6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 33px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 66.7546%; height: 33px;\">Successive shots (crew can see where most recent miss landed)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 32.5858%; height: 33px;\">Cumulative +2 per previous miss (maximum +10)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 33px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 66.7546%; height: 33px;\">Successive shots (crew can't see where most recent miss landed, but observer is providing feedback)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 32.5858%; height: 33px;\">Cumulative +1 per previous miss (maximum +5)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 66.7546%; height: 16px;\">Successive shots after hit</td>\n<td style=\"width: 32.5858%; height: 16px;\">+10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

Reviving and Replacing Companions}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Having a companion in the party is an incredible opportunity for the GM to introduce plot elements into a campaign&mdash;and more interesting plots than &ldquo;the companion has been kidnapped!&rdquo; The players have a general idea about their characters&rsquo; pre-adventurer histories, but a companion is a bit of a mystery. What did it do before it met you? What is its motivation for joining the adventuring party? What are its goals? What does it do when you aren&rsquo;t around?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Animal Companion</h2>\n<p>Unless you raised your animal companion from birth, it has its own history and secrets that are likely important and could surprise you. a druid&rsquo;s wolf companion might have been saved by a famous ranger, fought in an orc tribe&rsquo;s arena, or escaped a wizard&rsquo;s experimental lab. What happens when that wolf recognizes that helpful ranger, savage orc, or mad wizard? Is the wolf aggressive when the druid isn&rsquo;t around? Does it have behavior quirks like not letting anyone touch the druid when she&rsquo;s sleeping, even allies trying to wake her? What if the companion was once a humanoid, but was cursed or polymorphed into a different shape and lost its memory about its original identity? What if another druid previously cast awaken on it, and it has been pretending to be a common animal so it can watch over or spy on a PC? The answers to these questions are the seeds to side plots or entire adventures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Animal companions can also incite fear or prejudice among ignorant townsfolk. Most villages don&rsquo;t want rowdy adventurers bringing wolves, bears, lions, giant snakes, and especially dinosaurs into the town square, and innkeepers don&rsquo;t usually want the larger animals staying in rooms with guests. Stables might charge more to board exotic animals or entirely refuse to do so, and might not have appropriate food for them. If a village is experiencing attacks on its livestock, angry people might be quick to blame a carnivorous animal companion. Conversely, innocent children could have a circus-like fascination with exotic animal companions and help break the ice between visiting adventurers and suspicious locals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cohort</h2>\n<p>A cohort could have a former life as a criminal that she abandoned after being inspired by your heroic deeds. Just like a PC, a cohort has family and friends, with hopes and concerns for those people. The cohort might be a target for your enemies who are unwilling or unable to strike directly at you (though be careful to avoid making the cohort become a liability or look incompetent). a cohort who is critically injured by a monster might develop a fear about that kind of monster and avoid attacking it. She may have secret vices or virtues that become more prominent over time and can directly affect her relationship with you. If the cohort has an animal companion, you might also suffer some indirect repercussions for the animal&rsquo;s behavior or reputation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Eidolon</h2>\n<p>An eidolon has the same mystery as a cohort, except its origins are far weirder. It might have been linked to another summoner before its bond with you. It might be a natural creature altered by planar energies and banished to a far realm, or a former adventurer lost in a disastrous mission to an unknown plane. If it resembles a more conventional planar monster (such as an archon, a dretch, or an elemental), it might have been accidentally summoned or called by a sloppy spellcaster and could have some familiarity with other people in the world. Though an eidolon&rsquo;s soul is strongly tied to its summoner, it has an existence in another world when it is away, and in that world it might be a bully, champion, or slave. How it reacts to things during its limited time on the Material Plane is influenced by its unknown past and secret life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An eidolon always has the appearance of a fantastical creature, and attracts as much attention as any unfamiliar animal would. Fortunately for you, you can send the eidolon away to its extraplanar home, allowing you to do business in town and move about normally without drawing unwanted attention. However, if you call the eidolon in an emergency without warning the local authorities, townsfolk might assume it is a marauding monster bent on tearing them limb from limb, requiring hasty explanations and diplomacy to prevent panic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Familiar</h2>\n<p>Plot hooks for familiars are similar to those for animal companions, as they can have the same unknown backgrounds and instinctive reactions to people they knew when they were just common animals. Fortunately, familiars are usually small creatures that can easily pass for common pets as long as they don&rsquo;t do anything that reveals their unusual intelligence. Most townsfolk aren&rsquo;t averse to a common cat, a trained hawk, or even a snake, though innkeepers and merchants might ask that such animals be kept in a cage to prevent them from getting loose and causing any damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Remember that a familiar has an empathic link to its master, and its animal instincts can lead to plot hooks. For example, a toad familiar might project feelings of hunger whenever a member of a fly-demon cult is nearby, a bat familiar might express curiosity about the words a weird hermit is muttering under his breath, and a rat familiar might feel fear when a dangerous assassin walks into the room. a more powerful familiar can speak with other animals of its kind, and if left to roam, it could pick up interesting news about a town or an army camp.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Follower</h2>\n<p>A follower should be more than an acquaintance or an employee. a follower is devoted to you in the same way a cohort is, but has fewer resources at his disposal and in most cases isn&rsquo;t an adventurer. The follower sees you as a hero or celebrity&mdash;someone to emulate. Though it&rsquo;s easy to treat followers as a single, nameless group, a smart player realizes that they don&rsquo;t have to group together. Followers can be spread out over multiple settlements and have multiple roles. For example, if you have a Leadership score of 10, you can have five 1st-level followers: a city guard in the capital, an acolyte at the high temple, an informant in the thieves&rsquo; guild, an adept in a frontier village, and a strange child saved from a goblin&rsquo;s hunger. Gaining followers is an opportunity for you to look back over your adventuring career, recall important or noteworthy NPCs, and solidify the bonds between those NPCs and you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Choosing followers gives you a network of loyal contacts who trust and respect you. Though they might not have the resources or backbone to fight on your behalf, they&rsquo;re always on the lookout for ways to help you in any way they can. In effect, they are trustworthy NPC contacts (Trust score 4; see Contacts). The city guard might invite you to gamble with the other guards or arrange to have your armor polished. The acolyte might have tips about an upcoming religious festival and the clergy&rsquo;s concerns about a nearby plague. The informant might have news about mysterious disappearances or volunteer to keep an eye on your rival. a thug might bully the truth out of a tight-lipped witness or provide inside information on her employer. The adept might send messages about strange events from the wildlands. The strange child might have precognitive visions, perhaps from budding magical powers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you ever lose or dismiss your cohort, selecting a replacement from among your followers not only gives you an excuse to spend some downtime training that follower to become your new cohort, but rewards the loyalty of all the other followers, as they see that you treat them as near equals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The GM should use these followers as plot hooks. Instead of having rumors from an unknown source reach your ears from no specific source, a named follower could present that information. Instead of having you hunt for information about a cataclysm prophesied to occur in 3 days, a scholarly follower could find a scroll or book about the prophecy and bring it to you. The desperate stable-boy follower can approach you about money to pay off his father&rsquo;s gambling debts to a crooked bookkeeper. The poor merchant can ask you for help dealing with a charismatic man trying to convince his daughter to become a prostitute. By using a follower for a plot hook, the GM lets the player know that the character can trust the follower&rsquo;s intentions, and keeps the PC&rsquo;s past involvement with that NPC relevant.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As you reach higher Leadership scores, you gain dozens of followers. Rather than these followers all being spread thinly across every possible settlement in the campaign, it&rsquo;s more likely that many of these individual followers know each other well, possibly by working together, spending time at the same temple or academy, or being members of the same family, and you should expand these clusters of followers in an organic way. For example, the other guards who gamble with you could become new followers, the acolyte can train other acolytes or spread the good word about you, the informant might persuade others in the thieves&rsquo; guild that you&rsquo;re a valuable ally, the adept&rsquo;s entire village might begin to see you as a hero and savior, and the strange child could become a wizard&rsquo;s apprentice and convince the entire cabal to befriend you. If you ever decide to build a fort or found a temple or guild, you already have a group of like-minded and skilled followers ready and willing to help.</p>"}

Each square of difficult terrain counts as 2 squares of movement. Each diagonal move into a difficult terrain square counts as 3 squares. You can&rsquo;t run or charge across difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>If you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can move only as fast as the most difficult terrain you occupy will allow.</p>\n<p>Flying and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by difficult terrain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Obstacles</h2>\n<p>Like difficult terrain, obstacles can hamper movement. If an obstacle hampers movement but doesn&rsquo;t completely block it, each obstructed square or obstacle between squares counts as 2 squares of movement. You must pay this cost to cross the obstacle, in addition to the cost to move into the square on the other side. If you don&rsquo;t have sufficient movement to cross the obstacle and move into the square on the other side, you can&rsquo;t cross it. Some obstacles may also require a skill check to cross.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some obstacles block movement entirely. A character can&rsquo;t move through a blocking obstacle.</p>\n<p>Flying and incorporeal creatures are able to avoid most obstacles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Squeezing</h2>\n<p>In some cases, you may have to squeeze into or through an area that isn&rsquo;t as wide as the space you take up. You can squeeze through or into a space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. Each move into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in a narrow space, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls and a &ndash;4 penalty to AC.</p>\n<p>When a Large creature (which normally takes up 4 squares) squeezes into a space that&rsquo;s 1 square wide, the creature&rsquo;s miniature figure occupies 2 squares, centered on the line between the 2 squares. For a bigger creature, center the creature likewise in the area it squeezes into.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A creature can squeeze past a creature while moving but it can&rsquo;t end its movement in an occupied square.</p>\n<p>To squeeze through or into a space less than half your space&rsquo;s width, you must use the Escape Artist skill. You can&rsquo;t attack while using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into a narrow space, you take a &ndash;4 penalty to AC, and you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-buffs.XDuJwn4sGLcklc9P]{Debuff: Squeezing (&lt; &frac12; space)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-buffs.Un3yEd7l1wt9VEF7]{Debuff:&nbsp;Squeezing (&frac12; space)}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-buffs.Ej91vWnfFTaxMhyZ]{Debuff:&nbsp;Squeezing (large)}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Fifty of each needed material component are required (one for each charge). Material components are consumed when work begins, but focuses are not. A focus used in creating a wand can be reused. The act of working on the wand triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable for casting during each day devoted to the wand&rsquo;s creation.

Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more favorable conditions, increasing the odds of success.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Taking 10</h2>\n<p>When your character is not in immediate danger or distracted, you may choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10. In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety measure&mdash;you know (or expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking 10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll wouldn&rsquo;t help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Taking 20</h2>\n<p>When you have plenty of time, you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being attempted carries no penalties for failure, you can take 20. In other words, if you roll a d20 enough times, eventually you will get a 20. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a 20.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes that you fail many times before succeeding. Taking 20 takes 20 times as long as making a single check would take (usually 2 minutes for a skill that takes 1 round or less to perform).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since taking 20 assumes that your character will fail many times before succeeding, your character would automatically incur any penalties for failure before he or she could complete the task (hence why it is generally not allowed with skills that carry such penalties). Common &ldquo;take 20&rdquo; skills include Disable Device (when used to open locks), Escape Artist, and Perception (when attempting to find traps).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ability Checks and Caster Level Checks</h2>\n<p>The normal take 10 and take 20 rules apply for ability checks.</p>\n<p>Neither rule applies to concentration checks or caster level checks.</p>"}

When a spellcaster undercasts a spell, it is treated exactly like the lower-level version, including when determining its effect, saving throw, and other variables. For example, a psychic spellcaster who adds ego whip III to his list of spells known can cast it as ego whip I, II, or III. If he casts it as ego whip I, it is treated in all ways as that spell; it uses the text and the saving throw DC for that spell, and requires him to expend a 3rd-level spell slot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whenever a spontaneous spellcaster adds a spell to his list of spells known that can be undercast, he can immediately learn a spell in place of each lower-level version of that spell he knows.

This maneuver covers any sort of situational attack that imposes a penalty on a foe for a short period of time. Examples include kicking sand into an opponent&rsquo;s face to blind him for 1 round, pulling down an enemy&rsquo;s pants to halve his speed, or hitting a foe in a sensitive spot to make him sickened for a round. The GM is the arbiter of what can be accomplished with this maneuver, but it cannot be used to impose a permanent penalty, and the results can be undone if the target spends a move action. If you do not have the Improved Dirty Trick feat or a similar ability, attempting a dirty trick provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your attack is successful, the target takes a penalty. The penalty is limited to one of the following conditions: blinded, dazzled, deafened, entangled, shaken, or sickened. This condition lasts for 1 round. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent&rsquo;s CMD, the penalty lasts 1 additional round. This penalty can usually be removed if the target spends a move action. If you possess the Greater Dirty Trick feat, the penalty lasts for 1d4 rounds, plus 1 round for every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent&rsquo;s CMD. In addition, removing the condition requires the target to spend a standard action.</p>"}

Magic Item Creation}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 468</em></p>\n<p>A magic weapon is enhanced to strike more truly and deliver more damage. Magic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses to both attack and damage rolls when used in combat. All magic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonuses on attack rolls do not stack with their enhancement bonuses on attack rolls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonuses apply to both melee and ranged attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some magic weapons have special abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses except where specifically noted). A single weapon cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents, including from character abilities and spells) higher than +10. A weapon with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus. Weapons cannot possess the same special ability more than once.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Weapons or ammunition can be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01&ndash;95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96&ndash; 100 indicates that it is made of a special material (see Chapter 6).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Caster Level for Weapons</h2>\n<p>The caster level of a weapon with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus and no other abilities, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Additional Damage Dice</h2>\n<p>Some magic weapons deal additional dice of damage. Unlike other modifiers to damage, additional dice of damage are not multiplied when the attacker scores a critical hit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ranged Weapons and Ammunition</h2>\n<p>The enhancement bonus from a ranged weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus from ammunition. Only the higher of the two enhancement bonuses applies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Ammunition and Breakage</h2>\n<p>When a magic arrow, crossbow bolt, or sling bullet misses its target, there is a 50% chance it breaks or is otherwise rendered useless. A magic arrow, bolt, or bullet that successfully hits a target is automatically destroyed after it delivers its damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Light Generation</h2>\n<p>Fully 30% of magic weapons shed light equivalent to a light spell. These glowing weapons are quite obviously magical. Such a weapon can&rsquo;t be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Some of the specific weapons detailed below always or never glow, as defined in their descriptions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hardness and Hit Points</h2>\n<p>Each +1 of a magic weapon&rsquo;s enhancement bonus adds +2 to its hardness and +10 to its hit points. See also Table 7&ndash;12 on page 175.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Activation</h2>\n<p>Usually a character benefits from a magic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon&mdash; by wielding (attacking with) it. If a weapon has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to utter a command word (a standard action). A character can activate the special abilities of 50 pieces of ammunition at the same time, assuming each piece has identical abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Weapons and Critical Hits</h2>\n<p>Some weapon special abilities and some specific weapons have an extra effect on a critical hit. This special effect also functions against creatures not normally subject to critical hits. On a successful critical roll, apply the special effect, but do not multiply the weapon&rsquo;s regular damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weapons for Unusually Sized Creatures</h2>\n<p>The cost of weapons for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium varies (see Chapter 6). The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Special Qualities</h2>\n<p>Roll d%. A 01&ndash;30 result indicates that the item sheds light, 31&ndash;45 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon&rsquo;s function, and 46&ndash;100 indicates no special qualities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 15-8: Weapons</h2>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">Minor</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Medium</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Major</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Weapon Bonus</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Base Price<sup>1</sup></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>01-70</td>\n<td>01-10</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>2,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>71-85</td>\n<td>11-29</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+2</td>\n<td>8,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>30-58</td>\n<td>01-20</td>\n<td>+3</td>\n<td>18,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>59-62</td>\n<td>21-38</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>32,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>39-49</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n<td>50,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+6<sup>2</sup></td>\n<td>72,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+7<sup>2</sup></td>\n<td>98,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+8<sup>2</sup></td>\n<td>128,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+9<sup>2</sup></td>\n<td>162,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+10<sup>2</sup></td>\n<td>200,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>86-90</td>\n<td>63-68</td>\n<td>50-63</td>\n<td>Specifc weapon<sup>3</sup></td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>92-100</td>\n<td>69-100</td>\n<td>64-100</td>\n<td>Special ability and roll again<sup>4</sup></td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br />1 For ammunition, this price is for 50 arrows, bolts, or bullets.<br />2 A weapon can&rsquo;t have an enhancement bonus higher than +5.

However, it also causes those who spend extended amounts of time near it to grow ill and die unless proper precautions are taken. Abysium is associated with conjuration magic, zeal, and sloth. Abysium functions as steel when used to craft weapons and armor, but anyone who carries or wears abysium arms or armor becomes sickened for as long as the gear is carried or worn, plus an additional 1d4 hours after it is removed. Likewise, a character in an area with heavy concentrations of abysium becomes sickened as long as he remains in the area. This is a poison effect. In Thassilon, wealthy lords often built manacles or prison bars out of Abysium in order to keep their prisoners debilitated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Weapons and armor made from abysium glow with an intensity equal to that of a candle. Scholars have long debated where the glow and associated sickening effect come from, but most agree that the source of the power comes from the Abyss itself, due to the nature of the energy contained in abysium. Pure or properly refined abysium produces this energy in a way that can be harnessed by arcane engines and technologies to generate energy sources strong enough to power extensive magical creations like golems, traps, or magical items the size of buildings. Most secrets of harnessing this power have long been lost, but as the Shattered Star Adventure Path continues, the PCs will have many chances to learn more about this dangerous technology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Abysium can also be powdered and alchemically distilled with other rare catalysts and chemicals to form a much more potent toxin. It was in this form that the metal was most traditionally used in ancient Thassilon.

Magic Item Creation}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 163</em></p>\n<p>A wordcaster still has spell slots, just like other members of his class, but he uses them differently. Each spell slot holds a wordspell or allows a wordcaster to arrange a number of words of power into one. The level of the wordcaster&rsquo;s wordspell is determined by the arrangement of words. Each word of power has a level associated with it and, in some cases, restrictions on what other words can be arranged in a wordspell with it. The level of a word is also the minimum level of the spell slot that can be used to arrange that word into a wordspell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a wordcaster belongs to a class that prepares spells, he must arrange his words of power into wordspells when he prepares his spells, deciding in advance the exact combination of words that will occupy each of his available spell slots and the wordspells that arrangement makes. If a wordcaster belongs to a class that spontaneously casts spells, such as a sorcerer, he can arrange his wordspells as he casts them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each wordspell is made up of an arrangement of two or more words of power, including one target word, one or more effect words, and possibly a number of meta words.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Target Word</h2>\n<p>This word determines the range of a wordspell, how the wordspell manifests, and what it can affect. If the wordspell has an area, it affects every creature in the area defined by the target word. If it has targets, it affects the specific targets described by its word. A wordspell can have only one target word.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Effect Word</h2>\n<p>Effect words determine what effect a wordspell has when cast. They also determine the schools of the wordspell and its duration, saving throw, and spell resistance, if any. A wordspell can have more than one effect word, even ones from different schools of magic. In this case, the spell counts as both schools of magic. The maximum level of the effect words contained within a wordspell depends on the level of the spell slot used and the number of words arranged in the wordspell, as noted on Table 4&ndash;1: Effect Word Combinations. For example, a 5th-level wordspell might include one 5th-level effect word, two 3rd-level effect words, or three 2nd-level effect words. Alternatively, the wordspell might include one 4th-level effect word and one 2nd-level effect word, or one 3rd level effect word and two 1st-level effect words.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Effect words are split into groups of similar words. A wordspell typically cannot have more than one effect word from the same group, but there are exceptions. A wordspell can have more than one effect word from the Detection group, but cannot have a wordspell with an effect word from the Detection group and an effect word from any other group.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Meta Word</h2>\n<p>This word modifies the wordspell in some way, often by increasing either its duration, range, or components. It can also boost certain target or effect words, changing the wordspell&rsquo;s overall effect. Unlike with other words, a wordcaster can only use meta words a number of times per day equal to half his caster level in his wordcasting class (minimum 1). A wordspell does not need to contain a meta word.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A wordspell can have multiple meta words arranged within it so long as each target word and each effect word are modified by only one meta word apiece. For example, a wordspell arranged with two effect words could have up to three meta words, so long as each meta word modifies a different target and effect word.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 4-1: Effect Word Combinations</h2>\n<table style=\"height: 176px; width: 80.434%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.4254%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Word Level</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 25.4317%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">One Effect Word</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0016%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Two Effect Words</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.8273%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Three Effect Words</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.4254%; height: 16px;\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 25.4317%; height: 16px;\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0016%; height: 16px;\">-</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.8273%; height: 16px;\">-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.4254%; height: 16px;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 25.4317%; height: 16px;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0016%; height: 16px;\">-</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.8273%; height: 16px;\">-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.4254%; height: 16px;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 25.4317%; height: 16px;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0016%; height: 16px;\">0/0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.8273%; height: 16px;\">-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.4254%; height: 16px;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 25.4317%; height: 16px;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0016%; height: 16px;\">1/1 or 2/0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.8273%; height: 16px;\">0/0/0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.4254%; height: 16px;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 25.4317%; height: 16px;\">4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0016%; height: 16px;\">2/2 or 3/1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.8273%; height: 16px;\">1/1/1/ or 2/0/0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.4254%; height: 16px;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 25.4317%; height: 16px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0016%; height: 16px;\">3/3 or 4/2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.8273%; height: 16px;\">2/2/2 or 3/1/1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.4254%; height: 16px;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 25.4317%; height: 16px;\">6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0016%; height: 16px;\">4/4 or 5/3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.8273%; height: 16px;\">3/3/3 or 4/2/2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.4254%; height: 16px;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 25.4317%; height: 16px;\">7</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0016%; height: 16px;\">5/5 or 6/4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.8273%; height: 16px;\">4/4/4 or 5/3/3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.4254%; height: 16px;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 25.4317%; height: 16px;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0016%; height: 16px;\">6/6 or 7/5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.8273%; height: 16px;\">5/5/5 or 6/4/4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.4254%; height: 16px;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 25.4317%; height: 16px;\">9</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0016%; height: 16px;\">7/7/ or 8/6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.8273%; height: 16px;\">6/6/6 or 7/5/5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

Undercasting Spells}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Occult Adventures pg. 144</em></p>\n<p>Psychic magic originates from the distinctive qualities of the caster&rsquo;s composite being, rather than through arcane formulae or rote supplication to divine entities. Therefore, psychic spells never have verbal or somatic components, and have only expensive material components. Psychic spells are purely mental actions, and they can be cast even while the caster is pinned or paralyzed. Focus components work the same way with psychic spells as they do with other spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When a spell calls for an expensive material component, a psychic spellcaster can instead use any item with both significant meaning and a value greater than or equal to the spell&rsquo;s component cost. For example, if a spiritualist wanted to cast raise dead to bring her dead husband back from the grave, she could use her 5,000 gp wedding ring as the spell&rsquo;s material component.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Instead of verbal and somatic components, all psychic spells have components related to the caster&rsquo;s inner being. The two psychic components are called emotion components and thought components. If a spell&rsquo;s components line lists a somatic component, that spell instead requires an emotion component when cast by psychic spellcasters, and if it has a verbal component, it instead requires a thought component when cast by psychic spellcasters. Psychic spells cast by non-psychic arcane and divine casters use any listed somatic and verbal components as normal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Emotion Components</h2>\n<p>Emotion components represent a particular emotional state required to cast the spell. A psychic spellcaster marshals her desire in order to focus and release the spell&rsquo;s energy. It is impossible to cast a spell with an emotion component while the spellcaster is under the inf luence of a non-harmless effect with the emotion or fear descriptors. (The emotion descriptor was originally introduced in Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic.) Even if the effect&rsquo;s emotion matches the necessary emotion to cast the psychic spell, the spellcaster is not in control of her own desires and animal impulses, which is a necessary part of providing an emotion component.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Thought Components</h2>\n<p>Thought components represent mental constructs necessary for the spell&rsquo;s function, such as picturing a wolf in vivid detail&mdash;down to the saliva dripping from its jaws&mdash;in order to cast beast shape to transform into a wolf. Thought components are so mentally demanding that they make interruptions and distractions extremely challenging. The DC for any concentration check for a spell with a thought component increases by 10. A psychic spellcaster casting a spell with a thought component can take a move action before beginning to cast the spell to center herself; she can then use the normal DC instead of the increased DC.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just as spell-like abilities never require verbal, somatic, or material components, these abilities also don&rsquo;t require thought or emotion components. A psychic spellcaster can replace verbal and somatic components with thought and emotion components only for the purposes of the spell components themselves, not for the purposes of any other rules elements that relate to verbal and somatic components. She can&rsquo;t use Silent Spell to ignore the thought component of a spell, for example. The new feats Intuitive Spell and Logical Spell serve a similar function for these new components.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-feats.wi6Oo8ZIpTfhIwOG]{Intuitive Spell}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-feats.jFzlsdbPYzyLlEdD]{Logical Spell}</p>"}

The base DC of the performance combat check is determined by the current attitude of the crowd toward the side of combat.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Starting or Current Attitude</td>\n<td>Base DC to Improve Attitude</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hostile</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unfriendly</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Indifferent</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Friendly</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Helpful</td>\n<td>201</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>1: This is the DC to gain a victory poitn The base DC is modified by the size of the crowd, the number of participants on each side, and a number of other circumstances.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Size of the Crowd</h2>\n<p>Larger crowds are harder to sway to one side or the other. It takes great shows of daring or a progression of numerous displays of crowd-pleasing actions to get them to change their attitude. Presented here are the general crowd sizes and their effects on the DC to improve crowd attitudes and gain victory points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Small Crowd</h2>\n<p>A small crowd contains no fewer than two and no more than 25 creatures. It does not increase the base DC of all performance combat checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Medium Crowd</h2>\n<p>A medium crowd contains no fewer than 26 and no more than 100 creatures. A medium crowd increases the DC of all performance combat checks by +2. Large Crowd: A large crowd contains no fewer than 101 and no more than 300 creatures. A large crowd increases the DC of all performance combat checks by +3.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Massive Mob</h2>\n<p>A massive mob is made up of no fewer than 301 creatures, and its numbers can expand into the thousands. A massive mob increases the DC of all performance combat checks by +4.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Total Number of Combatants</h2>\n<p>The participation of a large number of combatants increases the difficulty of swaying the crowd. Large groups of combatants make it difficult for a crowd to follow the entire battle and to catch actions from individuals that could possibly sway the audience&rsquo;s attitude. Adjust these modifications as combatants enter or leave the battle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Small Battle</h2>\n<p>If the battle is between a total of 2&ndash;8 combatants, there is no change to the base DC to improve the attitude of the crowd or gain victory points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Medium Battle</h2>\n<p>If the battle is between 9&ndash;16 combatants, the DC to improve the attitude of the crowd or gain victory points increases by +4.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Large Battle</h2>\n<p>A battle with 17 or more total combatants increases the DC to improve the attitude of the crowd by +8.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Other Circumstances That Affect DC</h2>\n<p>Other circumstances that always affect the DC to improve the attitude of the crowd or gain victory points include the following.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cheating</h2>\n<p>If one side visibly cheats or breaks the rules, the DC for that side of the performance combat to improve the attitude of the crowd increases by 2 for the remainder of the performance combat. This increase can occur multiple times in a battle. For the purpose of spotting cheating, determine the base Perception and Sense Motive for the average member of a crowd (usually +0 if you assume an average human) and apply the following modifiers based on crowd size. The DC is based on whatever action the combatant is using to hide any cheating (usually Bluff or Stealth).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Crowd Size</td>\n<td>Bonus on Perception and Sense Motive Checks to Spot Cheating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small crowd</td>\n<td>+8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium crowd</td>\n<td>+12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large crowd</td>\n<td>+16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Massive mob</td>\n<td>+20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Outnumbered</h2>\n<p>If one side of the battle outnumbers the others by less than a 2:1 ratio, the DC for that side to improve the attitude of the crowd or to gain victory points increases by 2. If one side outnumbers all others by a ratio of 2:1 or more, the DC for that side to improve the attitude of the crowd increases by 6. These increases to the DC end or are reduced to the appropriate level if the numbers become even or if the 2:1 ratio of combatants is ever brought down to outnumbering the other sides by less than a 2:1 ratio.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Unfair Advantage</h2>\n<p>If one side of the battle has an obvious unfair advantage (for example, one side starts the battle in a fortified position or has better weapons and armor, or its opponents are not armed at all), the DC to improve the attitude of the crowd is increased by 2. A GM can increase the DC by as much as 6 if the unfair advantage is severe enough. Bribery or Coercion: Crowds can be bribed or coerced. Typically a successful bribe or attempt at coercion involves paying some amount of gold based on the crowd size, and succeeding at a Diplomacy check with a DC based on the size of the crowd. If the gold is paid and the Diplomacy check fails, the side gains a penalty for cheating instead, though the gold is still spent. If the check succeeds, the DC to improve crowd reaction and gain victory points decreases by 2. For every 5 points over the DC by which the combatants make the check, the DC to improve the crowd&rsquo;s attitude or to gain a victory point decreases by 1.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Crowd Size</td>\n<td>Diplomacy DC</td>\n<td>Gold Paid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Small crowd</td>\n<td>DC 15</td>\n<td>25 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium crowd</td>\n<td>DC 20</td>\n<td>250 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Large crowd</td>\n<td>DC 25</td>\n<td>750 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Massive mob</td>\n<td>DC 30</td>\n<td>2,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

Special Materials}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Source PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 140</p>\n<p>From the common longsword to the exotic dwarven urgrosh, weapons come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All weapons deal hit point damage. This damage is subtracted from the current hit points of any creature struck by the weapon. When the result of the die roll to make an attack is a natural 20 (that is, the die actually shows a 20), this is known as a critical threat (although some weapons can score a critical threat on a roll of less than 20). If a critical threat is scored, another attack roll is made, using the same modifiers as the original attack roll. If this second attack roll is equal to or greater than the target&rsquo;s AC, the hit becomes a critical hit, dealing additional damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories. These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon&rsquo;s use (simple, martial, or exotic), the weapon&rsquo;s usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size (Small, Medium, or Large).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons</h2>\n<p>Anybody but a druid, monk, or wizard is proficient with all simple weapons. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are proficient with all simple and all martial weapons. Characters of other classes are proficient with an assortment of simple weapons and possibly some martial or even exotic weapons. All characters are proficient with unarmed strikes and any natural weapons possessed by their race. A character who uses a weapon with which he is not proficient takes a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Melee and Ranged Weapons</h2>\n<p>Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Reach Weapons</h2>\n<p>Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, and whips are reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren&rsquo;t adjacent to him. Most reach weapons double the wielder&rsquo;s natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Double Weapons</h2>\n<p>Dire flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes, quarterstaves, and two-bladed swords are double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if f ighting with two weapons, but he incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just as though the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon (see page 202).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The character can also choose to use a double weapon two-handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double weapon in one hand can&rsquo;t use it as a double weapon&mdash;only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Thrown Weapons</h2>\n<p>Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder applies his Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that isn&rsquo;t designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn&rsquo;t have a numeric entry in the Range column on Table 6&ndash;4), and a character who does so takes a &ndash;4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Projectile Weapons</h2>\n<p>Blowguns, light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite shortbows, longbows, composite longbows, halfling sling staves, hand crossbows, and repeating crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character gets no Strength bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it&rsquo;s a specially built composite shortbow or longbow, or a sling. If the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when he uses a bow or a sling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ammunition</h2>\n<p>Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), darts (for blowguns), or sling bullets (for slings and halfling sling staves). When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading (as noted in their descriptions). Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons on page 149), and what happens to them after they are thrown.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons</h2>\n<p>This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon&rsquo;s size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Light</h2>\n<p>A light weapon is used in one hand. It is easier to use in one&rsquo;s off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and can be used while grappling (see Chapter 8). Add the wielder&rsquo;s Strength modifier to damage rolls for melee attacks with a light weapon if it&rsquo;s used in the primary hand, or half the wielder&rsquo;s Strength bonus if it&rsquo;s used in the off hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on damage; the Strength bonus applies as though the weapon were held in the wielder&rsquo;s primary hand only. An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>One-Handed</h2>\n<p>A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder&rsquo;s Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it&rsquo;s used in the primary hand, or 1/2 his Strength bonus if it&rsquo;s used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat, add 1-1/2 times the character&rsquo;s Strength bonus to damage rolls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Two-Handed</h2>\n<p>Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the character&rsquo;s Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weapon Size</h2>\n<p>Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A weapon&rsquo;s size category isn&rsquo;t the same as its size as an object. Instead, a weapon&rsquo;s size category is keyed to the size of the intended wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder, a onehanded weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Inappropriately Sized Weapons</h2>\n<p>A creature can&rsquo;t make optimum use of a weapon that isn&rsquo;t properly sized for it. A cumulative &ndash;2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn&rsquo;t proficient with the weapon, a &ndash;4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder&rsquo;s size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. For example, a Small creature would wield a Medium one-handed weapon as a two-handed weapon. If a weapon&rsquo;s designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can&rsquo;t wield the weapon at all.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Improvised Weapons</h2>\n<p>Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses an improvised weapon in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a &ndash;4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.</p>"}

Miscellaneous Actions}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 181</em></p>\n<p>An action&rsquo;s type essentially tells you how long the action takes to perform (within the framework of the 6-second combat round) and how movement is treated. There are six types of actions: standard actions, move actions, full-round actions, swift actions, immediate actions, and free actions.</p>\n<p>In a normal round, you can perform a standard action and a move action, or you can perform a full-round action. You can also perform one swift action and one or more free actions. You can always take a move action in place of a standard action.</p>\n<p>In some situations (such as in a surprise round), you may be limited to taking only a single move action or standard action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For a full Table along with which actions provoke attacks of opportunity, see:</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.gm-quick-reference.SWqKXW5UFTffIcpI]{Combat Actions (AoO)}.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Standard Action</h2>\n<p>A standard action allows you to do something, most commonly to make an attack or cast a spell. See @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.rBQpOuMH0B3O44Da]{2.02.1. Standard Actions} for other standard actions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Move Action</h2>\n<p>A move action allows you to move up to your speed or perform an action that takes a similar amount of time. @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.m0W4ZfFwuk8VvtqJ]{2.02.2. Move Actions} for other move actions.</p>\n<p>You can take a move action in place of a standard action. If you move no actual distance in a round (commonly because you have swapped your move action for one or more equivalent actions), you can take one 5-foot step either before, during, or after the action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Full-Round Action</h2>\n<p>A full-round action consumes all your effort during a round. The only movement you can take during a full-round action is a 5-foot step before, during, or after the action. You can also perform free actions and swift actions (see below). See @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.q5bgNObausAXw2UA]{2.02.3. Full-Round Actions} for a list of full-round actions.</p>\n<p>Some full-round actions do not allow you to take a 5-foot step.</p>\n<p>Some full-round actions can be taken as standard actions, but only in situations when you are limited to performing only a standard action during your round. The descriptions of specific actions detail which actions allow this option.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Free Action</h2>\n<p>Free actions consume a very small amount of time and effort. You can perform one or more free actions while taking another action normally. However, there are reasonable limits on what you can really do for free, as decided by the GM.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.cxuyKuA6aplz0W8K]{2.02.4. Free Actions}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Swift Action</h2>\n<p>A swift action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. You can perform only a single swift action per turn.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.EwuWKrrT3zgSlesa]{2.02.5. Swift Actions}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Immediate Action</h2>\n<p>An immediate action is very similar to a swift action, but can be performed at any time&mdash;even if it&rsquo;s not your turn.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.MXmX8k8motOf98dp]{2.02.6. Immediate Actions}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Not an Action</h2>\n<p>Some activities are so minor that they are not even considered free actions. They literally don&rsquo;t take any time at all to do and are considered an inherent part of doing something else, such as nocking an arrow as part of an attack with a bow.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.n3ejDpqIKzKy97TU]{2.02.7. Miscellaneous Actions}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Restricted Activity</h2>\n<p>In some situations, you may be unable to take a full round&rsquo;s worth of actions. In such cases, you are restricted to taking only a single standard action or a single move action (plus free and swift actions as normal). You can&rsquo;t take a full-round action (though you can start or complete a full-round action by using a standard action; see below).</p>"}

A spell is a one-time magical effect. Spells come in two types: arcane (cast by bards, sorcerers, and wizards) and divine (cast by clerics, druids, and experienced paladins and rangers). Some spellcasters select their spells from a limited list of spells known, while others have access to a wide variety of options.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most spellcasters prepare spells in advance&mdash;whether from a spellbook or through prayers&mdash;while some cast spells spontaneously without preparation.

Driving Devices}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 171</em></p>\n<p>Every vehicle has a method of propulsion. Creatures pull chariots and wagons. Boats and ships are propelled by water currents, wind, muscle, or all three forces. Fantastical airships are held aloft by a variety of propulsion sources, both magical and mundane. The method of propulsion typically affects the speed and maneuverability of a vehicle, but more importantly, a vehicle&rsquo;s propulsion determines the required skill needed to control a vehicle. The following are the general methods of vehicle propulsion, along with what skills are typically needed to drive such vehicles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alchemical</h2>\n<p>Rarely, an alchemical engine may propel a vehicle. Powered by steam or more volatile gases and reagents, a vehicle with an alchemical engine requires either a Knowledge (arcana) or Craft (alchemy) check to be driven. The base DC to drive an alchemical vehicle is 10 higher than normal. Alchemical engines can be extremely powerful, with the ability to propel vehicles hundreds of times their size. They can also be very fickle when driven by creatures uninitiated in the secrets of alchemy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When a driver makes a driving check to control an alchemically propelled vehicle with a Wisdom check or a skill she is not trained in and rolls a natural 1, the vehicle&rsquo;s alchemical engine gains the broken condition. When it gains the broken condition, the vehicle&rsquo;s maximum speed and acceleration are both halved, and if the vehicle is currently moving at a rate faster than its new maximum speed, it immediately slows to that speed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Current</h2>\n<p>From canoes and large ships to winged gliders, vehicles propelled by currents typically manipulate an already existing power source within or outside of nature&mdash; an air current, a water current, or more exotic currents, like conduits of magical energy. Usually, manipulating a current-propelled vehicle requires a skill like Fly, Knowledge (nature), Profession (sailor), Survival, or even Acrobatics or Knowledge (arcana), depending on the nature or makeup of the vehicle and the current the vehicle is manipulating.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Water Current</h2>\n<p>Vehicles that only rely on currents of water for their propulsion are somewhat limited. These vehicles can only move in the direction and at the speed of a current unless they also employ some other means of propulsion or manipulation, and thus often have an additional form of propulsion, such as muscle in the case of a canoe, and wind in the case of a galley. A current-driven ship such as a river barge with a crew of two or more creatures requires either a Profession (sailor) or Knowledge (nature) check for the driving check, as ships require precision, discipline, and knowledge of the natural world. Smaller water-current vehicles, like canoes, use the Survival skill as the drive skill, as reading the terrain is a very important aspect of maintaining control over those types of vehicles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If it moves with the current, a water-current vehicle&rsquo;s maximum speed depends on the speed of the current (often as high as 120 feet). The acceleration of a water-current vehicle is 30 feet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Air Current</h2>\n<p>Air-current vehicles are rather diverse. They can be sailing ships, airships, land ships, or even gliders. A vehicle propelled by air with a crew of two or more creatures requires a Profession (sailor) or Knowledge (nature) check as its driving check. Because of their complexity, air-current vehicles always have their driving check DCs increased by 10. Smaller air-current vehicles, such as gliders and wind sleds, use Acrobatics or Fly instead. Much of their control depends on knowledge of flight or proper movements of the body to control the vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Smaller vehicles (size Large or smaller) can move at a speed of 60 feet, can move at twice that amount when they are moving with the air current, and have an acceleration of 30 feet. Larger vehicles can move at a speed of 90 feet, or twice that amount when they are moving with the air current, and have an acceleration of 30 feet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weird Current</h2>\n<p>Navigating currents of magical energy, burning magma, or the murky rivers of the Shadow Plane could use a number of skills, but likely use skills similar to those needed to operate water-current and air-current vehicles. Weird-current vehicles always have their driving check DCs increased by 10, and sometimes by 15 in more exotic locales and conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Weird-current vehicles typically move at the speed of water or air currents, depending on their nature, but have been known to move twice or even triple those speeds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic</h2>\n<p>Magic provides some of the most powerful and easy-to-use methods of propelling a vehicle, such as an elemental-powered juggernaut or an airship with an arcane device at its heart. Often simply identifying the properties of the magic item providing propulsion gives a creature the ability to use it, but sometimes more complicated magical devices require Spellcraft or Use Magic Device to drive properly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Muscle</h2>\n<p>From a chariot to a slave ship filled with captive rowers, moving a vehicle powered by muscle is all about getting a creature or creatures to push, pull, or otherwise propel the vehicle. Based on the type and intelligence of the creatures moving the vehicle, checks for driving muscle-propelled vehicles can use a diverse number of skills, including, but not limited to, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Intimidate, and Profession (driver).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Muscle-propelled vehicles come in two forms: pulled and pushed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pulled</h2>\n<p>This type of propulsion involves one or more creature pulling a vehicle. Unless the creature pulling the vehicle is intelligent (Intelligence score of 3 or higher), either Handle Animal or Profession (driver) is used for the driving check (driver&rsquo;s choice). Intelligent creatures must be convinced with a Diplomacy check (decrease the driving check by 5 if the creature or creatures have the helpful attitude), or forced with an Intimidate check. Forcing an intelligent creature to pull a vehicle increases the DC by 20.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A creature can pull a number of vehicle squares equal to the number of squares in the creature&rsquo;s space to a top speed equal to twice the creature&rsquo;s speed. It can accelerate its space in vehicle squares up to its speed. For instance, a single horse takes up 4 squares, and can pull a 4-square cart 100 feet each round with an acceleration of 50 feet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pushed</h2>\n<p>Pushed vehicles are the exact opposite of pulled vehicles&mdash;vehicles that are pushed by muscle, usually using some form of device manipulated by crew members. Aquatic vehicles are the most likely to be pushed. Lines of rowers use their oars to push the vehicle forward, or a pair of cloud giants may churn a propeller at the aft end of a dirigible. Driving checks for pushed vehicles tend to be Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Handle Animal, depending on the intelligence and attitude of the creatures supplying the muscle for the propulsion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For intelligent creatures, use Diplomacy if the creatures providing the propulsion have an attitude of indifferent, friendly, or helpful (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 94). Decrease the Diplomacy driving check by 5 if the creatures providing the propulsion are friendly. Intimidate is used for intelligent creatures with an attitude of unfriendly or hostile. Handle Animal is used if the creatures providing the propulsion are not intelligent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A creature that is pushing a vehicle with the proper mechanical help can push between 5 times to 20 times its space in vehicle squares.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The maximum speed and acceleration of a muscle-propelled vehicle depends on the mechanism used to assist the pushing&mdash;see the sample vehicle statistics for examples.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mixed Methods of Propulsion</h2>\n<p>Large and complicated vehicles, such as large sailing ships, often use multiple forms of propulsion. Sometimes multiple methods add flexibility, but often they work in concert to create faster movement. A vehicle with multiple methods of propulsion often requires a large crew to get it going and keep it moving. If a vehicle has two methods of propulsion, it uses its fastest speed and acceleration and then adds half the speed and acceleration of the secondfastest propulsion. Nothing is added for a third form of propulsion, except for the flexibility of having a back-up form of propulsion.</p>"}

The user is mentally fooled into thinking the item is functioning and cannot be convinced otherwise without the casting of remove curse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Opposite Effect or Target</h2>\n<p>These cursed items malfunction, so that either they do the opposite of what the creator intended, or they target the user instead of someone else. The interesting point to keep in mind here is that these items aren&rsquo;t always bad to have. Opposite-effect items include weapons that impose penalties on attack and damage rolls rather than bonuses. Just as a character shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily immediately know what the enhancement bonus of a noncursed magic item is, she shouldn&rsquo;t immediately know that a weapon is cursed. Once she knows, however, the item can be discarded unless some sort of compulsion is placed upon it that compels the wielder to keep and use it.

To keep an item with this kind of curse functioning, one or more of the following conditions must be met.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Character must eat twice as much as normal.</li>\n<li>Character must sleep twice as much as normal.</li>\n<li>Character must undergo a specific quest (one time only, and the item functions normally thereafter).</li>\n<li>Character must sacrifice (destroy) 100 gp in valuables per day.</li>\n<li>Character must sacrifice (destroy) 2,000 gp worth of magic items each week.</li>\n<li>Character must swear fealty to a particular noble or to his entire family.</li>\n<li>Character must discard all other magic items.</li>\n<li>Character must worship a particular deity.</li>\n<li>Character must change her name to a specific name.

If the character gets the Constitution points back (such as from a restoration spell), the item ceases functioning. (The item does not cease functioning if the character receives a Constitution increase caused by level gain, a wish, or the use of a magic item.)</li>\n<li>Item must be cleansed with holy water each day.</li>\n<li>Item must be used to kill a living creature each day.</li>\n<li>Item must be bathed in volcanic lava once per month.</li>\n<li>Item must be used at least once a day, or it won&rsquo;t function again for its current possessor.</li>\n<li>Item must draw blood when wielded (weapons only). It can&rsquo;t be put away or exchanged for another weapon until it has scored a hit.</li>\n<li>Item must have a particular spell cast upon it each day (such as bless, atonement, or animate objects).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Requirements are so dependent upon suitability to the item that they should never be determined randomly. An intelligent item with a requirement often imposes its requirement through its personality. If the requirement is not met, the item ceases to function. If it is met, usually the item functions for one day before the requirement must be met again (although some requirements are one time only, others monthly, and still others continuous).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Drawback</h2>\n<p>Items with drawbacks are usually still beneficial to the possessor but carry some negative aspect. Although sometimes drawbacks occur only when the item is used (or held, in the case of some weapons), usually the drawback remains with the character for as long as she has the item. Unless otherwise indicated, drawbacks remain in effect as long as the item is possessed. The DC to save against any of these effects is usually equal to 10 + the item&rsquo;s caster level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"width: 97.3684%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.64493%;\" scope=\"col\">d%</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.0371%;\" scope=\"col\">Drawback</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.64493%;\">01-04</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.0371%;\">Character&rsquo;s hair grows 1 inch longer every hour.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 9.64493%;\">05-09</td>\n<td style=\"width: 90.0371%;\">Character either shrinks 6 inches (01&ndash;50 on d%) or grows that much taller (51&ndash;100).

Such fields typically convert all damage to nonlethal damage and prevent magic that instantly slays a foe or does permanent harm.

Duel Results</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 150</em></p>\n<p>A duel is a form of combat, but unlike ordinary combat, the participants must all agree to willingly enter the duel and abide by its rules. If either side breaks the rules, that side is considered the loser of the duel, regardless of any other outcome, and if its members continue aggressive action, the fight continues using the standard rules for combat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The rules for a duel are usually quite simple, but might vary if all of the participants are of a particular class or if all of the participants agree on specific restrictions or guidelines. Such discussions typically happen before the duel, allowing both sides to properly prepare, but as with all elements of a duel, this is not always the case. Most duels utilize the following simple rules.</li>\n<li>Each participant must fight alone and can receive no help from outside sources, with the exception of other creatures who are taking part in the duel, such as familiars, animal companions, or other bonded creatures. If the duel consists of more than one participant on a side, those fighting alongside one another are free to aid each other.</li>\n<li>The types of weapons that can be used in the duel are agreed upon before the duel begins. Typical restrictions include only using melee weapons, ranged weapons, unarmed (or natural) weapons, magic, or any combination of these. The rules of a duel may require all duel participants to use the same weapon or types of attacks. This is especially the case in duels that require swords, spells, or firearms. Absent any such rules, any type of weapon is permissible.</li>\n<li>The duel usually lasts until one of the combatants has been knocked unconscious or otherwise prevented from continuing. Spells such as hold person do not end duels, but flesh to stone certainly does, assuming the target fails her saving throw. Some duels go to the death and are only ended when one duelist or team is cut to pieces or reduced to a pile of smoking ashes. Other duels last until first blood, first strike, or a number of successful attacks. These latter types of duels are usually intended to settle disputes where a creature&rsquo;s death is not the required end result.</li>\n<li>In the case of duels that exclusively use magic, additional rules might prohibit the use of summoned or conjured creatures, unless the duel is performed by such creatures at the behest of the spellcasters involved (as is common among druids and summoners).</li>\n<li>In the case of duels exclusively among warriors, additional rules typically prohibit the use of poison or even entire types of attacks (such as prohibiting ranged attacks, or requiring the use of firearms). In addition, most such duels prohibit the use of magic that affects other participants, although spells that enhance the caster are sometimes allowed.</li>\n</ul>"}

Magic Item Creation}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 548</em></p>\n<p>To create magic items, spellcasters use special feats which allow them to invest time and money in an item&rsquo;s creation. At the end of this process, the spellcaster must make a single skill check (usually Spellcraft, but sometimes another skill) to finish the item. If an item type has multiple possible skills, you choose which skill to make the check with. The DC to create a magic item is 5 + the caster level for the item. Failing this check means that the item does not function and the materials and time are wasted. Failing this check by 5 or more results in a cursed item (see Cursed Items for more information).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note that all items have prerequisites in their descriptions. These prerequisites must be met for the item to be created. Most of the time, they take the form of spells that must be known by the item&rsquo;s creator (although access through another magic item or spellcaster is allowed). The DC to create a magic item increases by +5 for each prerequisite the caster does not meet. The only exception to this is the requisite item creation feat, which is mandatory. In addition, you cannot create potions, spell-trigger, or spell-completion magic items without meeting their spell prerequisites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While item creation costs are handled in detail below, note that normally the two primary factors are the caster level of the creator and the level of the spell or spells put into the item. A creator can create an item at a lower caster level than her own, but never lower than the minimum level needed to cast the needed spell. Using metamagic feats, a caster can place spells in items at a higher level than normal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Magic supplies for items are always half of the base price in gp. For many items, the market price equals the base price. Armor, shields, weapons, and items with value independent of their magically enhanced properties add their item cost to the market price. The item cost does not influence the base price (which determines the cost of magic supplies), but it does increase the final market price.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, some items cast or replicate spells with costly material components. For these items, the market price equals the base price plus an extra price for the spell component costs. The cost to create these items is the magic supplies cost plus the costs for the components. Descriptions of these items include an entry that gives the total cost of creating the item.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The creator also needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and well lit place in which to work. Any place suitable for preparing spells is suitable for making items. Creating an item requires 8 hours of work per 1,000 gp in the item&rsquo;s base price (or fraction thereof), with a minimum of at least 8 hours. Potions and scrolls are an exception to this rule; they can take as little as 2 hours to create (if their base price is 250 gp or less). Scrolls and potions whose base price is more than 250 gp, but less than 1,000 gp, take 8 hours to create, just like any other magic item. The character must spend the gold at the beginning of the construction process. Regardless of the time needed for construction, a caster can create no more than one magic item per day. This process can be accelerated to 4 hours of work per 1,000 gp in the item&rsquo;s base price (or fraction thereof) by increasing the DC to create the item by +5.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The caster can work for up to 8 hours each day. He cannot rush the process by working longer each day, but the days need not be consecutive, and the caster can use the rest of his time as he sees fit. If the caster is out adventuring, he can devote 4 hours each day to item creation, although he nets only 2 hours&rsquo; worth of work. This time is not spent in one continuous period, but rather during lunch, morning preparation, and during watches at night. If time is dedicated to creation, it must be spent in uninterrupted 4-hour blocks. This work is generally done in a controlled environment, where distractions are at a minimum, such as a laboratory or shrine. Work that is performed in a distracting or dangerous environment nets only half the amount of progress (just as with the adventuring caster).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A character can work on only one item at a time. If a character starts work on a new item, all materials used on the under-construction item are wasted.</p>"}

In the same way many of the spellblight conditions above offer advantages under the right conditions, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion, the standard conditions described in Appendix 2 of the Core Rulebook can provide benefits as well. If the following material gives a spell failure chance, this is in addition to other rolls to succeed at casting (such as caster level checks and arcane spell failure from armor) and is resolved after those rolls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bleed</h2>\n<p>While a spellcaster is affected by this condition, her inflict wounds spells inflict an extra point of damage per die. This only applies when using an inflict wounds spell, not when using those spells to heal undead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Blinded</h2>\n<p>A blinded spellcaster can use some of the energy of a spell with the light descriptor to try to counteract the blinded condition. Also, when a blinded spellcaster casts a spell with the light descriptor, she can choose to take a 20% chance of spell failure with that spell. If the caster successfully casts the spell, the spell also ends the blinded condition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Confused</h2>\n<p>While confused (either temporarily, or permanently by way of an insanity spell or effect), a spellcaster can tap into that confusion during periods of lucidity. When a confused spellcaster can act normally, the DCs of her spells that give confusion or insanity effects are increased by 1. The caster also gains a +2 competence bonus on caster level checks made to bypass spell resistance with those spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Entangled</h2>\n<p>A spellcaster who is entangled and casts a spell with the force descriptor can choose to take a 20% chance of spell failure on that spell. If she successfully casts the spell, she ends the entangled condition, or if she is anchored, her movement is no longer prevented, but she is still entangled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dazzled</h2>\n<p>A dazzled spellcaster can use some of the energy of a spell with the darkness descriptor to try to counteract the dazzled condition. When a dazzled spellcaster casts a spell with the darkness descriptor, she can choose to take a 20% chance of spell failure with that spell. If the caster successfully casts the spell, the spell also ends the dazzled condition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Deafened</h2>\n<p>A deafened spellcaster can use some of the energy of a spell with the sonic descriptor to try to counteract the deafened condition. When a deafened spellcaster casts a spell with the sonic descriptor, she can choose to take a 20% chance of spell failure with that spell. If the caster successfully casts the spell, the spell also ends the deafened condition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Disabled</h2>\n<p>A disabled spellcaster can tap into her fears of impending death to empower her conjuration (healing) spells. Once per day, while disabled due to damage taken, a spellcaster can choose to treat a single conjuration (healing) spell she casts on herself as having a caster level two levels higher than her actual caster level. She must actually cast the spell; this ability cannot raise the caster level of a spell cast from a magic item.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Grappled</h2>\n<p>While being grappled, a spellcaster can choose to take a 20% chance of spell failure when casting a touch attack spell. If the spell is successfully cast, the caster gains a +2 bonus on the attack roll against the creature grappling her.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nauseated</h2>\n<p>A nauseated spellcaster can use some of the energy of a conjuration (healing) spell to try to counteract the nauseated condition. When a nauseated spellcaster casts a conjuration (healing) spell, she can choose to take a 20% chance of spell failure with that spell. If the caster successfully casts the spell, the spell also ends the nauseated condition.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Poisoned or Sickened</h2>\n<p>Once per day, while a spellcaster is poisoned or sickened, she can take a 20% chance of spell failure when casting a single spell that causes a poison or sickened effect. If the spell is successful, the DC of any poison or sickened effect granted by that spell increases by 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shaken</h2>\n<p>While a spellcaster is shaken, once per day she can channel her fear to increase the power of a single spell with the fear descriptor that she casts. When she does so, the spell DC of that spell is increased by 1. She must actually cast the spell; this ability cannot raise the caster level of a spell cast from a magic item.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Staggered</h2>\n<p>Once per day, while a spellcaster is staggered, she can take a 20% chance of spell failure when casting a single spell that takes a swift or standard action to cast. If the spell is successfully cast, she can take a move action directly after casting the spell.</p>"}

Just as it's not necessary to know whether a wizard is using squid ink or ink from a rare plant when crafting a scroll of burning hands, it's not necessary to know whether he's modifying gestures described in Irulark's Incunabulum or altering the pronunciation of words detailed in Murlost's Great Grimoire to create a new 1st-level attack spell.</p>\n<p>While it's fine to include these elements for flavor, particularly in a high-narrative campaign, they don't affect the outcome of the item crafting or spell research, both of which largely take place outside of game time.

Lightning strikes often set trees ablaze and start forest fires in this way. Whatever the cause of the fire, travelers can get caught in the conflagration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A forest fire can be spotted from as far away as 2d6 &times; 100 feet by a character who makes a Perception check, treating the fire as a Colossal creature (reducing the DC by 16). If all characters fail their Perception checks, the fire moves closer to them. They automatically see it when it closes to half the original distance. With proper elevation, the smoke from a forest fire can be spotted as far as 10 miles away.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Characters who are blinded or otherwise unable to make Perception checks can feel the heat of the fire (and thus automatically &ldquo;spot&rdquo; it) when it is 100 feet away.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The leading edge of a fire (the downwind side) can advance faster than a human can run (assume 120 feet per round for winds of moderate strength). Once a particular portion of the forest is ablaze, it remains so for 2d4 &times; 10 minutes before dying to a smoking wasteland. Characters overtaken by a forest fire might find the leading edge of the fire advancing away from them faster than they can keep up, trapping them deeper and deeper within its grasp.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Within the bounds of a forest fire, a character faces three dangers: heat damage, catching on fire, and smoke inhalation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Heat Damage</h2>\n<p>Getting caught within a forest fire is even worse than being exposed to extreme heat (see Heat Dangers on page 444). Breathing the air causes a character to take 1d6 points of fire damage per round (no save). In addition, a character must make a Fortitude save every 5 rounds (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. A character who holds his breath can avoid the lethal damage, but not the nonlethal damage. Those wearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a &ndash;4 penalty on their saving throws. Those wearing metal armor or who come into contact with very hot metal are affected as if by a heat metal spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Catching on Fire</h2>\n<p>Characters engulfed in a forest fire are at risk of catching on fire when the leading edge of the fire overtakes them, and continue to be at risk once per minute thereafter. See Catching on Fire on page 444.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Smoke Inhalation</h2>\n<p>Forest fires naturally produce a great deal of smoke. A character who breathes heavy smoke must make a Fortitude save each round (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or spend that round choking and coughing. A character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. Smoke also provides concealment to characters within it.</p>"}

If you come to your next action and have not yet performed your readied action, you don&rsquo;t get to take the readied action (though you can ready the same action again). If you take your readied action in the next round, before your regular turn comes up, your initiative count rises to that new point in the order of battle, and you do not get your regular action that round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Distracting Spellcasters</h2>\n<p>You can ready an attack against a spellcaster with the trigger &ldquo;if she starts casting a spell.&rdquo; If you damage the spellcaster, she may lose the spell she was trying to cast (as determined by her concentration check result).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Readying to Counterspell</h2>\n<p>You may ready a counterspell against a spellcaster (often with the trigger &ldquo;if she starts casting a spell&rdquo;). In this case, when the spellcaster starts a spell, you get a chance to identify it with a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level). If you do, and if you can cast that same spell (and are able to cast it and have it prepared, if you prepare spells), you can cast the spell as a counterspell and automatically ruin the other spellcaster&rsquo;s spell. Counterspelling works even if one spell is divine and the other arcane. A spellcaster can use dispel magic to counterspell another spellcaster, but it doesn&rsquo;t always work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Readying a Weapon against a Charge</h2>\n<p>You can ready weapons with the brace feature, setting them to receive charges. A readied weapon of this type deals double damage if you score a hit with it against a charging character.</p>"}

Slimes, Molds, and Fungi}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 412</em></p>\n<p>Doors in dungeons are much more than mere entrances and exits. Often they can be encounters all by themselves. Dungeon doors come in three basic types: wooden, stone, and iron.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wooden Doors</h2>\n<p>Constructed of thick planks nailed together, sometimes bound with iron for strength (and to reduce swelling from dungeon dampness), wooden doors are the most common type. Wooden doors come in varying strengths: simple, good, and strong. Simple doors (break DC 15) are not meant to keep out motivated attackers. Good doors (break DC 18), while sturdy and long-lasting, are still not meant to take much punishment. Strong doors (break DC 25) are bound in iron and are a sturdy barrier to those attempting to get past them. Iron hinges fasten the door to its frame, and typically a circular pull-ring in the center is there to help open it. Sometimes, instead of a pull- ring, a door has an iron pull-bar on one or both sides of the door to serve as a handle. In inhabited dungeons, these doors are usually well-maintained (not stuck) and unlocked, although important areas are locked up if possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stone</h2>\n<p>Carved from solid blocks of stone, these heavy, unwieldy doors are often built so that they pivot when opened, although dwarves and other skilled craftsfolk are able to fashion hinges strong enough to hold up a stone door. Secret doors concealed within a stone wall are usually stone doors. Otherwise, such doors stand as tough barriers protecting something important beyond. Thus, they are often locked or barred.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Iron</h2>\n<p>Rusted but sturdy, iron doors in a dungeon are hinged like wooden doors. These doors are the toughest form of nonmagical door. They are usually locked or barred.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Breaking Doors</h2>\n<p>Dungeon doors might be locked, trapped, reinforced, barred, magically sealed, or sometimes just stuck. All but the weakest characters can eventually knock down a door with a heavy tool such as a sledgehammer, and a number of spells and magic items give characters an easy way around a locked door. Attempts to literally chop down a door with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon use the hardness and hit points given in Table 13&ndash;2. When assigning a DC to an attempt to knock a door down, use the following as guidelines.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DC 10 or Lower: a door just about anyone can break open.</p>\n<p>DC 11&ndash;15: a door that a strong person could break with one try and an average person might be able to break with one try.</p>\n<p>DC 16&ndash;20: a door that almost anyone could break, given time.</p>\n<p>DC 21&ndash;25: a door that only a strong or very strong person has a hope of breaking, probably not on the first try.</p>\n<p>DC 26 or Higher: a door that only an exceptionally strong person has a hope of breaking.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Locks</h2>\n<p>Dungeon doors are often locked, and thus the Disable Device skill comes in very handy. Locks are usually built into the door, either on the edge opposite the hinges or right in the middle of the door. Built-in locks either control an iron bar that juts out of the door and into the wall of its frame, or else a sliding iron bar or heavy wooden bar that rests behind the entire door. By contrast, padlocks are not built-in but usually run through two rings, one on the door and the other on the wall. More complex locks, such as combination locks and puzzle locks, are usually built into the door itself. Because such keyless locks are larger and more complex, they are typically only found in sturdy doors (strong wooden, stone, or iron doors).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Disable Device DC to pick a lock often falls within the range of 20 to 30, although locks with lower or higher DCs can exist. A door can have more than one lock, each of which must be unlocked separately. Locks are often trapped, usually with poison needles that extend out to prick a rogue&rsquo;s finger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Breaking a lock is sometimes quicker than breaking the whole door. If a PC wants to whack at a lock with a weapon, treat the typical lock as having hardness 15 and 30 hit points. A lock can only be broken if it can be attacked separately from the door, which means that a built-in lock is immune to this sort of treatment. In an occupied dungeon, every locked door should have a key somewhere.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A special door might have a lock with no key, instead requiring that the right combination of nearby levers must be manipulated or the right symbols must be pressed on a keypad in the correct sequence to open the door.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stuck Doors</h2>\n<p>Dungeons are often damp, and sometimes doors get stuck, particularly wooden doors. Assume that about 10% of wooden doors and 5% of non-wooden doors are stuck. These numbers can be doubled (to 20% and 10%, respectively) for long-abandoned or neglected dungeons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Barred Doors</h2>\n<p>When characters try to bash down a barred door, it&rsquo;s the quality of the bar that matters, not the material the door is made of. It takes a DC 25 Strength check to break through a door with a wooden bar, and a DC 30 Strength check if the bar is made of iron. Characters can attack the door and destroy it instead, leaving the bar hanging in the now-open doorway.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Seals</h2>\n<p>Spells such as arcane lock can discourage passage through a door. A door with an arcane lock spell on it is considered locked even if it doesn&rsquo;t have a physical lock. It takes a knock spell, a dispel magic spell, or a successful Strength check to open such a door.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hinges</h2>\n<p>Most doors have hinges, but sliding doors do not. They usually have tracks or grooves instead, allowing them to slide easily to one side.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Standard Hinges</h2>\n<p>These hinges are metal, joining one edge of the door to the door frame or wall. Remember that the door swings open toward the side with the hinges. (So, if the hinges are on the PCs&rsquo; side, the door opens toward them; otherwise it opens away from them.) Adventurers can take the hinges apart one at a time with successful Disable Device checks (assuming the hinges are on their side of the door, of course). Such a task has a DC of 20 because most hinges are rusted or stuck. Breaking a hinge is difficult. Most have hardness 10 and 30 hit points. The break DC for a hinge is the same as for breaking down the door.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nested Hinges</h2>\n<p>These hinges are much more complex than ordinary hinges, and are found only in areas of excellent construction. These hinges are built into the wall and allow the door to swing open in either direction. PCs can&rsquo;t get at the hinges to fool with them unless they break through the door frame or wall. Nested hinges are typically found on stone doors but sometimes on wooden or iron doors as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pivots</h2>\n<p>Pivots aren&rsquo;t really hinges at all, but simple knobs jutting from the top and bottom of the door that fit into holes in the door frame, allowing the door to spin. The advantages of pivots are that they can&rsquo;t be dismantled like hinges and they&rsquo;re simple to make. The disadvantage is that since the door pivots on its center of gravity (typically in the middle), nothing larger than half the door&rsquo;s width can fit through without squeezing. Doors with pivots are usually stone and often quite wide to overcome this disadvantage. Another solution is to place the pivot toward one side and have the door be thicker at that end and thinner toward the other end so that it opens more like a normal door. Secret doors in walls often turn on pivots, since the lack of hinges makes it easier to hide the door&rsquo;s presence. Pivots also allow objects such as bookcases to be used as secret doors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Secret Doors</h2>\n<p>Disguised as a bare patch of wall (or floor or ceiling), a bookcase, a fireplace, or a fountain, a secret door leads to a secret passage or room. Someone examining the area finds a secret door, if one exists, on a successful Perception check (DC 20 for a typical secret door to DC 30 for a well-hidden secret door).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many secret doors require special methods of opening, such as hidden buttons or pressure plates. Secret doors can open like normal doors, or they might pivot, slide, sink, rise, or even lower like a drawbridge to permit access. Builders might put a secret door low near the floor or high in a wall, making it difficult to find or reach. Wizards and sorcerers have a spell, phase door, that allows them to create a magic secret door that only they can use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Doors</h2>\n<p>Enchanted by the original builders, a door might speak to explorers, warning them away. It might be protected from harm, increasing its hardness or giving it more hit points as well as an improved saving throw bonus against disintegrate and similar spells. A magic door might not lead into the space behind it, but instead might be a portal to a faraway place or even another plane of existence. Other magic doors might require passwords or special keys to open them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Portcullises</h2>\n<p>These special doors consist of iron or thick, ironbound wooden shafts that descend from recesses in the ceilings above archways. Sometimes a portcullis has crossbars that create a grid, sometimes not. Typically raised by means of a winch or a capstan, a portcullis can be dropped quickly, and the shafts end in spikes to discourage anyone from standing underneath (or from attempting to dive under it as it drops). Once it is dropped, a portcullis locks, unless it is so large that no normal person could lift it anyway. In any event, lifting a typical portcullis requires a DC 25 Strength check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 13-2: Doors</h2>\n<table style=\"height: 177px; width: 97.8261%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 81.0458%; height: 16px;\" colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 18.6928%; height: 16px;\" colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\">Break DC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Door Type</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Typical Thickness</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Hardness</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Hit Points</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Stuck</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">Locked</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Simple wooden</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">1 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">10 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">13</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Good wooden</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">1-1/2 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">15 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">16</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 17px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 17px;\">Strong wooden</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 17px;\">2 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 17px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 17px;\">20 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 17px;\">23</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 17px;\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Stone</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">4 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">60 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">28</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">28</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Iron</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">2 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">60 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">28</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">28</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Portcullis, wooden</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">3 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">30 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">25*</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">25*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Portcullis, iron</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">2 in.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">60 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">25*</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">25*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Lock</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">15</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">30 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 27.3203%; height: 16px;\">Hinge</td>\n<td style=\"width: 25.4902%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.7255%; height: 16px;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.5098%; height: 16px;\">30 hp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 8.23529%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 10.4575%; height: 16px;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>*DC to lift.

This means that more than one such creature can fit into a single square. A Tiny creature typically occupies a space only 2-1/2 feet across, so four can fit into a single square. 25 Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine creatures can fit into a single square. Creatures that take up less than 1 square of space typically have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can&rsquo;t reach into adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent&rsquo;s square to attack in melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the opponent. You can attack into your own square if you need to, so you can attack such creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach, they do not threaten the squares around them. You can move past them without provoking attacks of opportunity. They also can&rsquo;t flank an enemy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures</h2>\n<p>Very large creatures take up more than 1 square.</p>\n<p>Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a natural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that they can reach targets even if they aren&rsquo;t in adjacent squares.</p>\n<p>Unlike when someone uses a reach weapon, a creature with greater than normal natural reach (more than 5 feet) still threatens squares adjacent to it. A creature with greater than normal natural reach usually gets an attack of opportunity against you if you approach it, because you must enter and move within the range of its reach before you can attack it. This attack of opportunity is not provoked if you take a 5-foot step.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Large or larger creatures using reach weapons can strike up to double their natural reach but can&rsquo;t strike at their natural reach or less.</p>\n<h2>Table 8-4: Creature Size and Scale</h2>\n<table style=\"height: 218px; width: 71.6311%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 10px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 10px;\" scope=\"col\">Creature Size</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 10px;\" scope=\"col\">Space*</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 10px;\" scope=\"col\">Natural Reach*</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 16px;\">Fine</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 16px;\">1/2 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 16px;\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 16px;\">Diminutive</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 16px;\">1 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 16px;\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 16px;\">Tiny</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 16px;\">2-1/2 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 16px;\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 16px;\">Small</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 16px;\">5 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 16px;\">5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 16px;\">Medium</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 16px;\">5 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 16px;\">5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 16px;\">Large (tall)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 16px;\">10 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 16px;\">10 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 16px;\">Large (long)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 16px;\">10 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 16px;\">5 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 16px;\">Huge (tall)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 16px;\">15 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 16px;\">15 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 16px;\">Huge (long)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 16px;\">15 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 16px;\">10 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 16px;\">Gargantuan (tall)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 16px;\">20 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 16px;\">20 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 16px;\">Gargantuan (long)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 16px;\">20 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 16px;\">15 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 16px;\">Colossal (tall)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 16px;\">30 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 16px;\">30 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 43.7788%; height: 16px;\">Colossal (long)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.6621%; height: 16px;\">30 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"width: 36.2519%; height: 16px;\">20 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>* These values are typical for creatures of the indicated size.

Second, because bards, oracles, and sorcerers can only learn a limited number of spells, a spell that can do multiple things is often a better choice for them because it&rsquo;s almost like learning multiple spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Examples of poorly designed spells with multiple, dissimilar options are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A general &ldquo;emotions&rdquo; spell that lets the caster project one of several emotions, each of which has a different effect on targets.</li>\n<li>A fire spell that lets the caster hurl a blast of fire, ignite multiple arrowheads to add fire damage, or make a protective shield of fire.</li>\n<li>A spell that works like bull&rsquo;s strength, but lets the caster choose which ability score it affects.</li>\n<li>A spell that either teleports the caster or can be used to send away an unwilling target.</li>\n<li>A spell that deals energy damage of a type chosen by the caster to an area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rather than create a multipurpose spell that gives a &ldquo;shopping list&rdquo; of effects the caster can choose from, keep the spell focused on one or perhaps two similar options. Note that there is a difference between a spell with multiple similar options and one with radically different options. Good examples of appropriate multipurpose spells are alarm (audible and mental alarms are still alarms), beast shape I (Small or Medium animals, specific benefits from a short list), fire shield (two options with basically the same mechanical effect, on par for a spell of its level), the summon monster spells (very versatile but of limited duration, with monsters of a lower power level than other spells of the same level).</p>"}

A spell-like ability has no verbal, somatic, or material component, nor does it require a focus. The user activates it mentally. Armor never affects a spell-like ability&rsquo;s use, even if the ability resembles an arcane spell with a somatic component.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A spell-like ability has a casting time of 1 standard action unless noted otherwise in the ability or spell description. In all other ways, a spell-like ability functions just like a spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance and dispel magic. They do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated. Spell-like abilities cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a character class grants a spell-like ability that is not based on an actual spell, the ability&rsquo;s effective spell level is equal to the highest-level class spell the character can cast, and is cast at the class level the ability is gained.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Supernatural Abilities</h2>\n<p>These can&rsquo;t be disrupted in combat and generally don&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity. They aren&rsquo;t subject to spell resistance, counterspells, or dispel magic, and don&rsquo;t function in antimagic areas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Extraordinary Abilities</h2>\n<p>These abilities cannot be disrupted in combat, as spells can, and they generally do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Effects or areas that negate or disrupt magic have no effect on extraordinary abilities. They are not subject to dispelling, and they function normally in an antimagic field. Indeed, extraordinary abilities do not qualify as magical, though they may break the laws of physics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Natural Abilities</h2>\n<p>This category includes abilities a creature has because of its physical nature. Natural abilities are those not otherwise designated as extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like.</p>"}

Magic Item Creation}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 164</em></p>\n<p>Casting a wordspell is similar to casting a standard spell. Each wordspell is assumed to have a material, somatic, and verbal component. Divine casters using this system must provide a divine focus instead of a material component. Unless otherwise noted, the material component can easily be found in a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wordspells take one standard action to cast and provoke attacks of opportunity as normal unless the caster casts the wordspell defensively. The DC for casting a wordspell defensively is the same as it is for a spell of the same level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The DC for any saving throw called for by the wordspell is calculated the same way as for any other spell of that level. A wordcaster uses the same ability score to determine her wordspell DC as an ordinary spellcaster of her class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Casting a wordspell is almost exactly the same as casting an ordinary spell. A wordspell can be dispelled and disrupted, and casting one provokes attacks of opportunity, just like any other spell, unless the wordcaster casts the wordspell on the defensive, which also requires a concentration check as normal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are two major differences to casting a wordspell: counterspelling and schools.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Counterspelling Wordspells</h2>\n<p>If a wordcaster is attempting to counter another wordspell, she can make a Spellcraft skill check as normal to identify the wordspell as it is being cast and then cast an identical wordspell to counter it. This means that the opposing wordcaster must know all of the effect words of the wordspell and either have an identical wordspell prepared or have an available spell slot of an equal or higher level. If the wordspell contains multiple effect words, but the opposing caster only knows one of the words (or only has a wordspell with one of the effect words prepared), that caster can still attempt to counter the wordspell, but this functions as if using dispel magic and does not come with the guarantee of success. The opposing caster must make a dispel check to counter the wordspell. She must still expend a spell of the same or higher level containing at least one word of the wordspell to be countered.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a wordcaster is attempting to counter the spell of a normal spellcaster, she must make a Spellcraft skill check to identify the school of the spell being cast. She can then counter that spell using any wordspell so long as it is of an equal or higher level than the spell being cast and contains at least one effect word of the same school as the spell. This works like a dispel magic counterspell attempt, and the wordcaster must make a dispel check to counter the spell. If a spellcaster attempts to counter a wordspell, she must use a spell of an equal or higher level that is of the same school as one or more of the effect words in the wordspell being cast. This too works like a dispel magic counterspell attempt, and the spellcaster must make a dispel check to counter the wordspell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wordspell Schools</h2>\n<p>If a wordspell has more than one effect word, it can belong to more than one school, although it never benefits from effects based on school (such as Spell Focus) more than once. It can take penalties based on school more than once; for example, if a target has a bonus on saving throws against necromancy and illusion spells, that character would add both bonuses on the saving throw if the wordspell is of both schools.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wordspell Saving Throws</h2>\n<p>The type of saving throw for a wordspell is determined by the highest-level effect word used that allows a saving throw. If the save is successful, it applies to both effect words, but the result for each word can vary based on the individual word. If the save fails, the target takes the full effect of both effect words. The save DC is equal to 10 + the wordspell&rsquo;s level (not the effect word&rsquo;s level) + the wordcaster&rsquo;s spellcasting ability score modifier (Intelligence for wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, and rangers; and Charisma for bards, paladins, and sorcerers).</p>\n<p>For example, if a 5th-level wordspell contains a 2nd-level effect word that allows a Ref lex save for half and a 4th-level effect word that allows a Will save to negate, targets of the wordspell make a Will save with a DC of 15 + the caster&rsquo;s ability score modifier. If the save is successful, the target takes half the normal effect from the 2nd-level word and negates the 4th-level word. If the save fails, the target takes the full effect of both effect words.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wordspells and Spell Resistance</h2>\n<p>If the wordspell uses more than one effect word, and any of those words allow spell resistance, the resistance applies to all of the effect words of the wordspell. A wordspell only ignores spell resistance if all effect words ignore spell resistance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Multiple Effect Words and Damage</h2>\n<p>If more than one effect word causes the wordspell to deal damage, the total number of dice of damage the wordspell can deal can be no greater than the wordspell&rsquo;s caster level. The caster can decide which dice belong to which effect word, in any combination, so long as the total number does not exceed his wordcaster level and the number of dice allocated to a specific effect word does not exceed its maximum.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Multiple Effect Words and Duration</h2>\n<p>If a wordspell has more than one effect word, the shortest of all the effect words&rsquo; durations is used for all of the effect words.</p>"}

When making a melee attack against a target that isn&rsquo;t adjacent to you (such as with a reach weapon), use the rules for determining cover from ranged attacks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Low Obstacles and Cover</h2>\n<p>A low obstacle (such as a wall no higher than half your height) provides cover, but only to creatures within 30 feet (6 squares) of it. The attacker can ignore the cover if he&rsquo;s closer to the obstacle than his target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cover and Attacks of Opportunity</h2>\n<p>You can&rsquo;t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cover and Reflex Saves</h2>\n<p>Cover grants you a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against attacks that originate or burst out from a point on the other side of the cover from you.

Magic Item Creation}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 461</em></p>\n<p>In general, magic armor protects the wearer to a greater extent than nonmagical armor. Magic armor bonuses are enhancement bonuses, never rise above +5, and stack with regular armor bonuses (and with shield and magic shield enhancement bonuses). All magic armor is also masterwork armor, reducing armor check penalties by 1.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. A suit of armor cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents, including from character abilities and spells) higher than +10. A suit of armor with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A suit of armor or a shield may be made of an unusual material.</p>\n<p>Roll d%: 01&ndash;95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96&ndash;100 indicates that it is made of a special material (see Chapter 6).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Armor is always created so that if the type of armor comes with a pair of boots, a helm, or a set of gauntlets, these pieces can be switched for other magic boots, helms, or gauntlets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Caster Level for Armor and Shields</h2>\n<p>The caster level of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shields</h2>\n<p>Shield enhancement bonuses stack with armor enhancement bonuses. Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as attack or damage bonuses when the shield is used in a shield bash. The bashing special ability, however, does grant a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls (see the special ability description).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A shield could be built that also acted as a magic weapon, but the cost of the enhancement bonus on attack rolls would need to be added into the cost of the shield and its enhancement bonus to AC.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value in the form of additions to the bonus of the shield, although they do not improve AC. A shield cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Activation</h2>\n<p>Usually a character benefits from magic armor and shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields: by wearing them. If armor or a shield has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to utter the command word (a standard action).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Armor for Unusual Creatures</h2>\n<p>The cost of armor for nonhumanoid creatures, as well as for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium, varies (see @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.ukz9B0kwM0KtLvRf]{6.0.3.2. Armor for Unusual Creatures}). The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 15-3: Armor and Shields</h2>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Minor</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>Major</td>\n<td>Item</td>\n<td>Base Price</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01-60</td>\n<td>01-05</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+1 shield</td>\n<td>1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>61-80</td>\n<td>06-10</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+1 armor</td>\n<td>1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81-85</td>\n<td>11-20</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+2 shield</td>\n<td>4,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>86-87</td>\n<td>21-30</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+2 armor</td>\n<td>4,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>31-40</td>\n<td>01-08</td>\n<td>+3 shield</td>\n<td>9,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>41-50</td>\n<td>09-16</td>\n<td>+3 armor</td>\n<td>9,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>51-55</td>\n<td>17-27</td>\n<td>+4 shield</td>\n<td>16,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>56-57</td>\n<td>28-38</td>\n<td>+4 armor</td>\n<td>16,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>39-49</td>\n<td>+5 shield</td>\n<td>25,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>50-57</td>\n<td>+5 armor</td>\n<td>25,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+6 armor/shield1</td>\n<td>36,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+7 armor/shield1</td>\n<td>49,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+8 armor/shield1</td>\n<td>64,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+9 armor/shield1</td>\n<td>81,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>+10 armor/shield1</td>\n<td>100,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>88-89</td>\n<td>58-60</td>\n<td>58-60</td>\n<td>Specific armor2</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>90-91</td>\n<td>61-63</td>\n<td>61-63</td>\n<td>Specific shield3</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>92-100</td>\n<td>64-100</td>\n<td>64-100</td>\n<td>Special ability and roll again4</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>1 Armor and shields can&rsquo;t have enhancement bonuses higher than +5.

This is known as &ldquo;multiclassing.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say a 5th-level fighter decides to dabble in the arcane arts, and adds one level of wizard when he advances to 6th level. Such a character would have the powers and abilities of both a 5th-level fighter and a 1st-level wizard, but would still be considered a 6th-level character. (His class levels would be 5th and 1st, but his total character level is 6th.) He keeps all of his bonus feats gained from 5 levels of fighter, but can now also cast 1st-level spells and picks an arcane school. He adds all of the hit points, base attack bonuses, and saving throw bonuses from a 1st-level wizard on top of those gained from being a 5th-level fighter.</p>\n<p>Note that there are a number of effects and prerequisites that rely on a character&rsquo;s level or Hit Dice. Such effects are always based on the total number of levels or Hit Dice a character possesses, not just those from one class.

However, there are several ways for you to temporarily or permanently gain the assistance of a companion, such as an animal companion, a cohort, an eidolon, or a familiar. The combat advantages of controlling a second creature are obvious, but having a companion also has drawbacks and requires an understanding of both your role and the GM&rsquo;s in determining the creature&rsquo;s actions. This section addresses common issues for companions and the characters who use them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How a companion works depends on the campaign as well as the companion&rsquo;s nature, intelligence, and abilities. In some cases, the rules do not specify whether you or the GM controls the companion. If you&rsquo;re entirely in control, the companion acts like a subsidiary PC, doing exactly what you want just like a true PC. If the GM is control, you can make suggestions or attempt to influence the companion, but the GM determines whether the creature is willing or able to attempt what you want.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Aspects of Control</h1>\n<p>Whether you or the GM controls a particular companion depends largely on the creature&rsquo;s intelligence and level of independence from you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nonsentient Companions</h2>\n<p>a nonsentient companion (one with animal-level intelligence) is loyal to you in the way a well-trained dog is&mdash;the creature is conditioned to obey your commands, but its behavior is limited by its intelligence and it can&rsquo;t make altruistic moral decisions&mdash;such as nobly sacrificing itself to save another. Animal companions, cavalier mounts, and purchased creatures (such as common horses and guard dogs) fall into this category. In general they&rsquo;re GM-controlled companions. You can direct them using the Handle Animal skill, but their specific behavior is up to the GM.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sentient Companions</h2>\n<p>A sentient companion (a creature that can understand language and has an Intelligence score of at least 3) is considered your ally and obeys your suggestions and orders to the best of its ability. It won&rsquo;t necessarily blindly follow a suicidal order, but it has your interests at heart and does what it can to keep you alive. Paladin bonded mounts, familiars, and cohorts fall into this category, and are usually player-controlled companions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Eidolons</h2>\n<p>Outside the linear obedience and intelligence scale of sentient and nonsentient companions are eidolons: intelligent entities magically bound to you. Whether you wish to roleplay this relationship as friendly or coerced, the eidolon is inclined to obey you unless you give a command only to spite it. An eidolon would obey a cruel summoner&rsquo;s order to save a child from a burning building, knowing that at worst the fire damage would temporarily banish it, but it wouldn&rsquo;t stand in a bonfire just because the summoner said to. An eidolon is normally a player-controlled companion, but the GM can have the eidolon refuse extreme orders that would cause it to suffer needlessly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magical Control</h2>\n<p>Charm person, dominate person, and similar effects turn an NPC into a companion for a limited time. Most charm-like effects make the target friendly to you&mdash;the target has to follow your requests only if they&rsquo;re reasonable, and has its own ideas about what is reasonable. For example, few creatures consider &ldquo;hand over all your valuables&rdquo; or &ldquo;let me put these manacles on you&rdquo; a reasonable request from a friend. You might have to use Diplomacy or Intimidate checks to influence a charmed ally, and the GM has the final say as to what happens. Though the target of a charm effect considers you a friend, it probably feels indifferent at best toward the other PCs and won&rsquo;t listen to requests from them. a creature under a dominate effect is more of a puppet, and you can force it to do anything that isn&rsquo;t suicidal or otherwise against its well-being. Treat it as player-controlled, with the GM making its saving throws to resist inappropriate commands.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Common Exceptions</h2>\n<p>Some companions are exceptions, such as an intelligent companion who doesn&rsquo;t bear exceptional loyalty toward you (for example, a hired guard), a weaker minion who is loyal to you but lacks the abilities or resources to assist in adventuring tasks, and a called outsider (such as from planar ally) who agrees to a specific service but still has a sense of self-preservation. You can use Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate to influence such companions, but the GM is the final arbiter of their actions. For example, a PC might use threats to convince a caravan guard to hold back an ogre for a few rounds or to prevent her zealous followers from attacking a rival adventurer, but the GM makes the decision whether the guard runs away after getting hit once or the followers attack when provoked.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The GM may deviate from the above suggestions, such as allowing a druid to control an animal companion directly, creating a more equivalent or even antagonistic relationship between a summoner and an eidolon, or roleplaying a mentoring relationship between a veteran warhorse and the young paladin who inherited his loyalty. Before you create a character with a companion creature (or decide to add a companion in play), the GM should explain to everyone how much influence you and the GM each have over the creature&rsquo;s actions. That way, everyone is fully informed about all aspects of dealing with the companion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The specifics of controlling a companion vary for different campaigns. a gritty campaign where animal companions can&rsquo;t do anything that real animals can&rsquo;t do forces the GM to act as a check against you pushing the bounds of creativity. a high-fantasy game where familiars are nearly as important to the storyline as the PCs&mdash;or are played as near-PCs by other players&mdash;is a very different feel and can create interesting roleplaying opportunities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An evil campaign where companions are unwilling slaves of the PCs creates a dynamic where the PCs are trying to exploit them as much as possible&mdash;perhaps even sacrificing and replacing them as needed&mdash;and treat them more like living tools than reluctant allies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Issues of Control</h1>\n<p>The GM should keep in mind several factors when it comes to companions, whether handling them as suggested above or altering the balance to give you more or less control.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ease of Play</h2>\n<p>Changing who controls a companion can make the game easier or harder for the GM. Controlling a cohort in combat is one more complex thing for the GM to deal with. The GM must keep track of a cohort&rsquo;s tactics and motivations and how those affect it in combat while keeping her own knowledge of the monsters separate from the cohort&rsquo;s knowledge; otherwise, the cohort will outshine the PCs with superior tactics. Giving you control over these decisions (while still allowing the GM to veto certain actions) alleviates some of the burden and allows you to plan interesting tactics between yourself and your cohort, much as you would have mastered during times you trained together.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Conversely, giving a player full control over the actions of two characters can slow down the game. If you&rsquo;re prone to choice paralysis, playing two turns every round can drag the game to a halt. If this is a problem, the GM should suggest that another player help run the companion or ask you to give up the companion and alter yourself to compensate (such as by choosing a different feat in place of Leadership, taking a domain instead of a druid animal companion, or selecting the &ldquo;companions&rdquo; option for a ranger&rsquo;s hunter&rsquo;s bond ability instead of an animal).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Game Balance</h2>\n<p>Even a simple change like allowing players to directly control companions has repercussions in the game mechanics. For example, if a druid has complete control over an animal companion, there&rsquo;s no reason for her to put ranks in Handle Animal, freeing up those ranks for other valuable skills like Perception. If a wizard with a guard dog doesn&rsquo;t have to use a move action to make a Handle Animal check to have the dog attack, he has a full set of actions each round and a minion creature that doesn&rsquo;t require investing any extra time to &ldquo;summon&rdquo; it. If companion animals don&rsquo;t have to know specific tricks, the PC can use any animal like an ally and plan strategies (like flanking) as if the animal were much smarter than it actually is.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With intelligent companions such as cohorts, giving you full control means you&rsquo;re controlling two characters and can take twice as many actions as the other players. The GM can create a middle ground, such as requiring you to put ranks in Handle Animal but not requiring you to make checks, or reducing the action needed to command an animal, but these decisions should be made before the companion joins the group.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sharing Information</h2>\n<p>Whenever you control multiple creatures, there are issues of sharing information between you and your companions. Some companions have special abilities that facilitate this sort of communication, such as a familiar&rsquo;s empathic link or an eidolon&rsquo;s bond senses ability, but most companions are limited to what they can observe with their own senses. For example, if a wizard using see invisibility knows there is an invisible rogue across the room, he can&rsquo;t just direct his guard dog to attack the rogue; he has to use the seek command to move the dog to the general area of the rogue, and even then he can&rsquo;t use the attack command to attack the rogue because the rogue isn&rsquo;t an &ldquo;apparent enemy.&rdquo; If the GM allows the wizard to make the dog fight the invisible rogue, that makes the animal much more versatile than normal, and also devalues the special nature of a true empathic or telepathic bond with a companion. If the dog is allowed to work outside the PC&rsquo;s line of sight, it devalues abilities such as a wizard&rsquo;s ability to scry on his familiar. Of course, intelligent companions using speech can bypass some of these limitations (such as telling a cohort there&rsquo;s an invisible rogue in the corner).</p>"}

The disadvantage is that such manipulation is less predictable and more difficult to pull off, but the advantage is that the target is not aware that he is being manipulated, whereas even the most successful Diplomacy or Intimidate attempt leaves the target realizing who has convinced him to take action.

In order to drive a vehicle, an intelligent creature must be within at least one square of the driving space and able to manipulate its driving device.

In addition, serpentstone can be set to radiate heat or cold, or produce illusory smoke, roiling forth thin streams of scented, incense-like fumes designed to delight, enlighten, or otherwise inform serpentfolk in the vicinity.

Two general types of enchantments affect characters and creatures: charms and compulsions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Charming another creature gives the charming character the ability to befriend and suggest courses of action to his minion, but the servitude is not absolute or mindless. Charms of this type include the various charm spells and some monster abilities. Essentially, a charmed character retains free will but makes choices according to a skewed view of the world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A charmed creature doesn&rsquo;t gain any magical ability to understand his new friend&rsquo;s language.</li>\n<li>A charmed character retains his original alignment and allegiances, generally with the exception that he now regards the charming creature as a dear friend and will give great weight to his suggestions and directions.</li>\n<li>A charmed character fights his former allies only if they threaten his new friend, and even then he uses the least lethal means at his disposal as long as these tactics show any possibility of success ( just as he would in a fight with an actual friend).</li>\n<li>A charmed character is entitled to an opposed Charisma check against his master in order to resist instructions or commands that would make him do something he wouldn&rsquo;t normally do even for a close friend. If he succeeds, he decides not to go along with that order but remains charmed.</li>\n<li>A charmed character never obeys a command that is obviously suicidal or grievously harmful to him.</li>\n<li>If the charming creature commands his minion to do something that the inf luenced character would be violently opposed to, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to break free of the inf luence altogether.</li>\n<li>A charmed character who is openly attacked by the creature who charmed him or by that creature&rsquo;s apparent allies is automatically freed of the spell or effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compulsion is a different matter altogether. A compulsion overrides the subject&rsquo;s free will in some way or simply changes the way the subject&rsquo;s mind works. A charm makes the subject a friend of the caster; a compulsion makes the subject obey the caster.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether a character is charmed or compelled, he does not volunteer information or tactics that his master doesn&rsquo;t ask for.</p>"}

Firearm Description}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 137</em></p>\n<p>There are two general categories of firearms: early and advanced.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Firearms are further divided into one-handed, twohanded, and siege firearms. As the category&rsquo;s name implies, one-handed firearms need only one hand to wield and shoot. Two-handed firearms work best when you use twohands while shooting them. Two-handed firearms can be shot with one hand at a &ndash;4 penalty on the attack roll. Siege weapons are typically mounted on some sort of platform, movable or otherwise, and have greater power but a much slower rate of fire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Scatter Weapon Quality</h2>\n<p>A weapon with the scatter weapon quality can shoot two different types of ammunition. It can fire normal bullets that target one creature, or it can make a scattering shot, attacking all creatures within a cone. Cannons with the scatter weapon quality only fire grapeshot, unless their descriptions state otherwise. When a scatter weapon attacks all creatures within a cone, it makes a separate attack roll against each creature within the cone. Each attack roll takes a &ndash;2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as Vital Strike. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not foil a scatter attack. If any of the attack rolls threaten a critical, confirm the critical for that attack roll alone. A firearm that makes a scatter shot misfires only if all of the attack rolls made misfire. If a scatter weapon explodes on a misfire, it deals triple its damage to all creatures within the misfire radius.</p>"}

Saving Throws}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 180</em></p>\n<p>Sometimes a combatant in a melee lets her guard down or takes a reckless action. In this case, combatants near her can take advantage of her lapse in defense to attack her for free. These free attacks are called attacks of opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Threatened Squares</h2>\n<p>You threaten all squares into which you can make a melee attack, even when it is not your turn. Generally, that means everything in all squares adjacent to your space (including diagonally). An enemy that takes certain actions while in a threatened square provokes an attack of opportunity from you. If you&rsquo;re unarmed, you don&rsquo;t normally threaten any squares and thus can&rsquo;t make attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Reach Weapons</h2>\n<p>Most creatures of Medium or smaller size have a reach of only 5 feet. This means that they can make melee attacks only against creatures up to 5 feet (1 square) away. However, Small and Medium creatures wielding reach weapons threaten more squares than a typical creature. In addition, most creatures larger than Medium have a natural reach of 10 feet or more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Provoking an Attack of Opportunity</h2>\n<p>Two kinds of actions can provoke attacks of opportunity: moving out of a threatened square and performing certain actions within a threatened square.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Moving</h2>\n<p>Moving out of a threatened square usually provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents. There are two common methods of avoiding such an attack&mdash;the 5-foot step and the withdraw action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Performing a Distracting Act</h2>\n<p>Some actions, when performed in a threatened square, provoke attacks of opportunity as you divert your attention from the battle. @Compendium[pf-content.gm-quick-reference.SWqKXW5UFTffIcpI]{Combat Actions (AoO)} notes many of the actions that provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>Remember that even actions that normally provoke attacks of opportunity may have exceptions to this rule.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Making an Attack of Opportunity</h2>\n<p>An attack of opportunity is a single melee attack, and most characters can only make one per round. You don&rsquo;t have to make an attack of opportunity if you don&rsquo;t want to. You make your attack of opportunity at your normal attack bonus, even if you&rsquo;ve already attacked in the round.</p>\n<p>An attack of opportunity &ldquo;interrupts&rdquo; the normal flow of actions in the round. If an attack of opportunity is provoked, immediately resolve the attack of opportunity, then continue with the next character&rsquo;s turn (or complete the current turn, if the attack of opportunity was provoked in the midst of a character&rsquo;s turn).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Combat Reflexes and Additional Attacks of Opportunity</h2>\n<p>If you have the Combat Reflexes feat, you can add your Dexterity bonus to the number of attacks of opportunity you can make in a round. This feat does not let you make more than one attack for a given opportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two attacks of opportunity from you, you could make two separate attacks of opportunity (since each one represents a different opportunity). Moving out of more than one square threatened by the same opponent in the same round doesn&rsquo;t count as more than one opportunity for that opponent. All these attacks are at your full normal attack bonus.</p>"}

The ground is nothing more than great, ever-shifting plates of compressed flame. The air ripples with the heat of continual firestorms and the most common liquid is magma. The oceans are made of liquid f lame, and the mountains ooze with molten lava. Fire survives here without needing fuel or air, but flammables brought onto the plane are consumed readily.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Planar Traits</h2>\n<p>The Plane of Fire has the following traits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fire-Dominant</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the fire descriptor or that use, manipulate, or create fire (including those of the Fire domain or the elemental [fire] bloodline) are enhanced.</li>\n<li><strong>Impeded Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities with the water descriptor or that use or create water (including spells of the Water domain, spell-like abilities of the elemental [water] bloodline, and spells that summon water elementals or outsiders with the water subtype) are impeded.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>A realm of perpetual conflagration, the Plane of Fire is a brilliant vortex of light and flames.</p>\n<p>Like the brilliant, fiery colors that dance within an all-consuming blaze, the Plane of Fire is both astonishingly beautiful and eminently hostile to most forms of life.</p>\n<p>Visitors able to safely traverse the Inferno are few and far between, as the plane quickly engulfs those without proper protection. Those who can endure its smoldering terrain&mdash; and the domains of its mercurial and often terribly cruel inhabitants&mdash;earn serious bragging rights back on their home planes, not to mention the wealth of treasure and adventure they might find here. For some elite explorers, the Plane of Fire&rsquo;s scintillating beauty is reward enough for visiting, though the dangers here are as unrivaled as they are alluring.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Immense swaths of the Plane of Fire consist of rolling seas of fire, rivers of lava, volcanic mountains, and burning plains, and with skies filled with flame, smoke, and rains of cinders, the landscapes here are strange indeed. In some areas, searing, sulfurous fumes supplant all breathable air, but even those places with a breathable atmosphere are often so hot that organic materials instantly sear to a crisp. In other cases, massive columns of fire engulf whole regions and contain their own unique ecosystems. Much of the plane&rsquo;s solid and semisolid surfaces are seas of liquid fire, molten metal, flowing lava, or other hazardous materials. Rains of melted metal, incendiary mists, and volcanic eruptions occur throughout the plane, often randomly and without warning.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ages ago, as efreeti cities grew to astonishing proportions, their inhabitants began abutting azer strongholds as they pleased. The efreet simply executed the headstrong azer leaders of fortresses that resisted, afterward taking the unmoored clans into their cities to form an openly oppressed&mdash;and sometimes outright enslaved&mdash;bottom-ranking class. One by one, the mighty azer fortresses fell, their insular inhabitants unaware of the injustices that had happened to their neighbors.</p>\n<p>Very few free azer strongholds remain, and empty and ruined fortresses stand across the landscape like iron husks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, rumors tell of a mighty azer empire that exists far below the plane&rsquo;s surface, embedded in the side of a massive basalt cliff behind a raging waterfall of lava. This empire has supposedly never had contact with any other intelligent races on the plane and has access to ancestral construct magic the likes of which the rest of the multiverse has never seen. Many intrepid explorers have set out to find this empire, but none have been successful. Those few who have returned live out the rest of their short days in a strange, horrified haze, repeating the words, &ldquo;Anything to sate the All-Father.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Denizens</h2>\n<p>Although it is inherently hostile to many forms of life, the Plane of Fire is home to a surprising breadth of fire-loving species. Below are details on some of the most common or significant creatures abiding on the plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Azers</h3>\n<p>Among the Eternal Furnace&rsquo;s most populous creatures, azers have a long, complex, and in many ways tragic history on the plane. These sturdy, dwarf-like people are hardworking and self-sufficient folk, and they once lived in carefully ordered societies secluded in fortresses of iron and brass scattered across the plane. However, while these societies had internal hierarchies that ensured they functioned as efficiently as clockwork, the ancestral azer realms never paid much attention to each other or to their homelands&rsquo; defenses, and this left the race ripe for exploitation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Efreet</h3>\n<p>The most widely recognized denizens of the Plane of Fire are the efreet, and for good reason: fire genies operate the most powerful empire in the Inferno&mdash;the Dominion of Flame. The dominion&rsquo;s cosmopolitan cities sprawl across the realm, bringing the genies&rsquo; overbearing elitism, deviousness, and cruelty to nearly every corner of the plane. Their capital, the City of Brass, is among the Great Beyond&rsquo;s most amazing achievements. The efreet&rsquo;s enemies are legion; efreet universally despise djinn, most consider themselves several orders of magnitude superior to the plane&rsquo;s mephit monarchy, and the efreet of the City of Brass remain in a state of open warfare with the shaitans of the Opaline Vault. Efreet think nothing of enslaving any creatures they can overpower, no matter on how large of a scale. However, despite their cruelty and volatility, they maintain a remarkable sense of terrible logic. The Dominion of Flame maintains a tense, though not openly violent, relationship with the shaitans of the Plane of Earth as a whole, and the two nations sometimes work together when the conditions are right.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Fire Elementals</h3>\n<p>The most abundant beings in the Eternal Furnace are its fire and magma elementals. Were they to form any large-scale, cohesive society, they could undoubtedly vie for control of the entire plane, but elementals simply don&rsquo;t think in those terms. Fiercely independent and open to negotiating with any nonhostile beings, fire elementals see themselves more as natural forces than as parts of any larger whole.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Magmins</h3>\n<p>Small but quite numerous pockets of the fiery, humanoid-shaped creatures known as magmins exist throughout the Eternal Furnace. Perhaps because magmins&rsquo; settlements tend to offer little plunder of value, or simply because the suspicious folk quickly annihilate visitors they believe to be threats, no major conquerors have arrived at their doorsteps. It&rsquo;s said to be nearly impossible for an extraplanar visitor to gain a magmin enclave&rsquo;s trust, but those who make the attempt often look to the creatures&rsquo; sacred magma pools for inspiration. Because magmins use the pools for everything from sustenance to bathing to recreation, offering precious minerals to add to the magma or protecting it from imminent threats can ingratiate such helpers with a community of magmins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Mephits</h3>\n<p>The Inferno&rsquo;s fire mephits are notable for their highly developed society. The theocratic mephits have expanded much in power over recent centuries, and as their realms have grown, their customs, taboos, and rituals have increased in complexity to a degree just short of those of the efreet. However, though they are not kind creatures, they are not nearly as haughty or self-obsessed as their more powerful genie counterparts.</p>"}

If you&rsquo;re designing an item or spell and want to include a certain type of bonus to a particular ability or statistic, check Table 2&ndash;7 first; if the bonus type doesn&rsquo;t say it can affect that ability or statistic, use one that does instead. One reason for this table is that some bonuses are better than others (deflection bonuses work against incorporeal creatures and when you are flat-footed, natural armor bonuses do not). A second reason is that allowing any kind of bonus on any roll or statistic makes it really easy to stack many small bonuses more cheaply than a larger bonus, which makes powerful magic items like a ring of protection +5 much less interesting. A third reason is that some of these combinations just don&rsquo;t make sense, like a deflection bonus to Strength or a shield bonus on Knowledge checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 2-7: Bonus Types and Effects</h2>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">Bonus Type</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Can Affect</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Sample Item</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Sample Spell</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Alchemical</td>\n<td>Ability scores, saves</td>\n<td>Antitoxin</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Armor</td>\n<td>AC</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Bracers%20of%20Armor1\">Bracers of armor</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Mage%20armor\">Mage armor</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Circumstance</td>\n<td>Attacks, checks</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Robe%20of%20Blending\">Robe of blending</a></td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Competence</td>\n<td>Attacks, checks, saves</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Boots%20of%20Elvenkind\">Boots of elvenkind</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Guidance\">Guidance</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deflection</td>\n<td>AC</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicRingsDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Ring%20of%20Protection1\">Ring of protection</a></td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dodge</td>\n<td>AC</td>\n<td>Never*</td>\n<td>Never*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enhancement</td>\n<td>Ability scores, AC, attacks, damage, speed</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Belt%20of%20Giant%20Strength2\">Belt of giant strength</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Magic%20weapon\">Magic weapon</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inherent</td>\n<td>Ability scores</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Manual%20of%20Bodily%20Health1\">Manual of bodily health</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Wish\">Wish</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Insight</td>\n<td>AC, attacks, checks, saves</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Ioun%20Stone%20Dusty%20Rose%20Prism\">Dusty rose prism ioun stone</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=True%20strike\">True strike</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Luck</td>\n<td>AC, attacks, checks, damage, saves</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Stone%20of%20Good%20Luck%20(Luckstone)\">Stone of good luck</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Divine%20favor\">Divine favor</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Morale</td>\n<td>Attacks, checks, damage, saves, Str, Con, Dex</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Candle%20of%20Invocation\">Candle of invocation</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Bless\">Bless</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Natural armor</td>\n<td>AC</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Amulet%20of%20Natural%20Armor1\">Amulet of natural armor</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Barkskin\">Barkskin</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Profane</td>\n<td>AC, checks, damage, DCs, saves</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Desecrate\">Desecrate</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resistance</td>\n<td>Saves</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Cloak%20of%20Resistance1\">Cloak of resistance</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Mind%20blank\">Mind blank</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sacred</td>\n<td>AC, checks, damage, DCs, saves</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Consecrate\">Consecrate</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shield</td>\n<td>AC</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicRingsDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Ring%20of%20Force%20Shield\">Ring of force shield</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Shield\">Shield</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Size</td>\n<td>Ability scores, attacks, AC</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Enlarge%20person\">Enlarge person</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>* Spells and magic items should never grant dodge bonuses because dodge bonuses always stack, and it would be a simple matter achieving that AC using the armor, deflection, enhancement, and natural armor bonuses in the game.</p>"}

Interestingly, they can still take damage from poison, but they are strong enough to withstand most ill effects and punish those who would inflict such treacherous pain on them. They are exceptionally vulnerable to unholy weapons; solars are also vulnerable to epic-strength weapons and artifacts. Angels&rsquo; protective auras grant them protection against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, as well as protecting those creatures around them. Any mortals who wish to deal with angels should be armed with humility and knowledge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Angels are immune to acid, cold, and petrification effects. They also have resistance to electricity 10 and fire 10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Astral Deva (SR 25)</h2>\n<p>Astral devas are the messengers of the gods of good&mdash;or, if one were to be cynical, the gossips of the heavens. The appropriate gift for an astral deva is knowledge of a place it cannot reach: a rival temple, the location of evil cultists, or some other evil that has a direct bearing on the Material Plane</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cassisian</h2>\n<p>The weakest sort of angels, cassisians serve as the messengers of more powerful angels, and frequently serve good spellcasters on the Material Plane as familiars. Formed from the souls of pious soldiers, they are often simply appeased with gifts that allow them to join the fray against evil creatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Monadic Deva (SR 23)</h2>\n<p>Watchers of the Ethereal Plane and the Elemental Planes, monadic devas usually serve those who summon them only in purposes that deal with their duties on those planes. Stubborn in their causes, they demand outrageous gifts of servitude toward their own lofty goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Movanic Deva (SR 21)</h2>\n<p>Soldier angels who often patrol the Positive Energy Plane, Negative Energy Plane, and Material Plane, these devas battle undead and the strange creatures that hunt the hungry void. When summoned to the Material Plane, they serve as forthright soldiers for the cause of good, and are appeased with gifts that allow them greater power to hunt undead and sceaduinar.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Planetar (SR 27)</h2>\n<p>As the leaders of celestial armies, planetars seek knowledge and information regarding the plans of their infernal foes.

You cannot spend more than 1 hero point during a single round of combat. Whenever a hero point is spent, it can have any one of the following effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Act Out of Turn</h2>\n<p>You can spend a hero point to take your turn immediately. Treat this as a readied action, moving your initiative to just before the currently acting creature. You may only take a move or a standard action on this turn. Bonus: If used before a roll is made, a hero point grants you a +8 luck bonus to any one d20 roll. If used after a roll is made, this bonus is reduced to +4. You can use a hero point to grant this bonus to another character, as long as you are in the same location and your character can reasonably affect the outcome of the roll (such as distracting a monster, shouting words of encouragement, or otherwise aiding another with the check). Hero points spent to aid another character grant only half the listed bonus (+4 before the roll, +2 after the roll).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Extra Action</h2>\n<p>You can spend a hero point on your turn to gain an additional standard or move action this turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>If you feel stuck at one point in the adventure, you can spend a hero point and petition the GM for a hint about what to do next. If the GM feels that there is no information to be gained, the hero point is not spent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Recall</h2>\n<p>You can spend a hero point to recall a spell you have already cast or to gain another use of a special ability that is otherwise limited. This should only be used on spells and abilities possessed by your character that recharge on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Reroll</h2>\n<p>You may spend a hero point to reroll any one d20 roll you just made. You must take the results of the second roll, even if it is worse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Special</h2>\n<p>You can petition the GM to allow a hero point to be used to attempt nearly anything that would normally be almost impossible. Such uses are not guaranteed and should be considered carefully by the GM. Possibilities include casting a single spell that is one level higher than you could normally cast (or a 1st-level spell if you are not a spellcaster), making an attack that blinds a foe or bypasses its damage reduction entirely, or attempting to use Diplomacy to convince a raging dragon to give up its attack. Regardless of the desired action, the attempt should be accompanied by a difficult check or penalty on the attack roll. No additional hero points may be spent on such an attempt, either by the character or her allies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cheat Death</h2>\n<p>A character can spend 2 hero points to cheat death. How this plays out is up to the GM, but generally the character is left alive, with negative hit points but stable. For example, a character is about to be slain by a critical hit from an arrow. If the character spends 2 hero points, the GM decides that the arrow pierced the character&rsquo;s holy symbol, reducing the damage enough to prevent him from being killed, and that he made his stabilization roll at the end of his turn. Cheating death is the only way for a character to spend more than 1 hero point in a turn. The character can spend hero points in this way to prevent the death of a familiar, animal companion, eidolon, or special mount, but not another character or NPC.</p>"}

Each length is taken, with leaves still attached, from a tree animated by a treant and cut with care to avoid the death of the tree. A dryad then speaks to and shapes the wood, coaxing the living green of the leaves into the grain of the wood itself. The resulting wood remains alive as long as it is doused with at least one gallon of water (plus 1 gallon for every 10 pounds of the item&rsquo;s weight) once per week and allowed to rest for an hour in contact with fertile soil. Any wooden or mostly wooden item (such as a bow or spear) made from greenwood is considered a masterwork item. Items not normally made of wood or only partially of wood (such as a battleaxe or a mace) either cannot be made from greenwood or do not gain any special benefit from being made of greenwood.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When damp and in contact with fertile soil, living greenwood heals damage to itself at a rate of 1 hit point per hour, even repairing breaks and regrowing missing pieces. If the weapon has the broken condition, it is repaired during the first hour of contact with fertile soil. Greenwood items take only one-quarter damage from fire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Greenwood can be altered or enhanced with wood-shaping magic such as ironwood, shape wood, and warp wood. The duration of any such effect on a greenwood item is doubled. To determine the price of a greenwood item, use the original weight but add 50 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item. Items made from darkwood cannot be made into greenwood.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Greenwood has the same hit points and hardness as wood.</p>"}

An alloy of gold and mithral, singing steel was originally created by the elves of Jinin, although the secrets of working singing steel have spread to Hwanggot, Minkai, and Tianjing.

Most armor made of singing steel is treated as one category lighter (heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light). The armor or shield&rsquo;s arcane spell failure chance is reduced by 5%, its maximum Dexterity bonus is increased by 1, and its armor check penalty is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When wielding a singing steel weapon, shield, or item weighing at least 5 pounds, or wearing medium or heavy singing steel armor, the wielder or wearer can strike the singing steel as part of beginning a bardic performance.

If the wielder can normally start a bardic performance as a move action, he can do so as a swift action instead. This ability does not function in the area of a silence spell or similar effect.

In the end, the Game Master is the one who gets to decide if something&rsquo;s in accordance with its indicated alignment, based on the descriptions given previously and his own opinion and interpretation&mdash;the only thing the GM needs to strive for is to be consistent as to what constitutes the difference between alignments like chaotic neutral and chaotic evil. There&rsquo;s no hard and fast mechanic by which you can measure alignment&mdash; unlike hit points or skill ranks or Armor Class, alignment is solely a label the GM controls.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s best to let players play their characters as they want. If a player is roleplaying in a way that you, as the GM, think doesn&rsquo;t fit his alignment, let him know that he&rsquo;s acting out of alignment and tell him why&mdash;but do so in a friendly manner. If a character wants to change his alignment, let him&mdash;in most cases, this should amount to little more than a change of personality, or in some cases, no change at all if the alignment change was more of an adjustment to more accurately summarize how a player, in your opinion, is portraying his character. In some cases, changing alignments can impact a character&rsquo;s abilities&mdash;see the class write-ups in Chapter 3 for details. An atonement spell may be necessary to repair damage done by alignment changes arising from involuntary sources or momentary lapses in personality.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Players who frequently have their characters change alignment should in all likelihood be playing chaotic neutral characters.</p>"}

This is similar to improving someone&rsquo;s attitude to friendly with Diplomacy and then making a request, but it doesn&rsquo;t require multiple rolls. Instead, the requests are restricted to those that provide limited assistance and actions that don&rsquo;t endanger the creature, including giving information. This means that an intimidated creature doesn&rsquo;t necessarily do what the intimidating character wants if it would be dangerous. After the Intimidate check, the target becomes unfriendly and might take actions such as reporting the intimidating character to the authorities. Thus, Diplomacy is often more likely to be successful in the long term in campaigns with interweaving plot lines and recurring characters. Since intimidation is based on fear, creatures immune to fear are also generally immune to attempts to use Intimidate against them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Posturing and Bluster</strong>: The rules for the Intimidate skill specify that a check&rsquo;s DC is based on the target&rsquo;s HD and Wisdom modifier. That generally works when one person is attempting to Intimidate the other, but sometimes both parties are actively participating in acts of posturing and bluster. Since this DC is usually low, the two characters would end up intimidating each other, which isn&rsquo;t quite realistic. Instead, consider opposed Intimidate checks, or if the situation warrants it, a full-fledged verbal duel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Explaining Negative Consequences</strong>: Sometimes a character wants to calmly explain negative consequences to someone in a way that merely relies on logic, not fear. This is particularly important when attempting to convince someone immune to fear, such as a paladin or vampire, to back down in the face of negative consequences. This is different than improving a creature&rsquo;s attitude or making a request (particularly since a character might try it with an unfriendly creature), so it doesn&rsquo;t fall under Diplomacy. One good way to handle this is to use the rules for influence or verbal duels instead, since those both allow for logic and knowledge to help impact the situation. If only a skill check is possible, consider allowing an Intimidate check that doesn&rsquo;t apply any modifiers tied to frightening the target (such as the Intimidating Prowess feat, size modifiers, an inquisitor&rsquo;s stern gaze, and so on) and then having the result not be a fear effect.</p>"}

Reviving and Replacing Companions}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Another issue is who gets to control the companion&rsquo;s advancement. Animal companions, eidolons, and cohorts all advance much like PCs, making choices about feats, skills, special abilities, and (in the case of cohorts) class levels. Whoever controls the companion&rsquo;s actions also makes decisions about its advancement, but there is more of a shared role between you and the GM for some types of companions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Animal Companion</h2>\n<p>Advancement choices for an animal companion include feats, skills, ability score increases, and tricks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the companion&rsquo;s Intelligence score is 2 or lower, it is limited to a small selection of feats. You should decide what feats the animal learns, though the GM should have a say about whether a desired feat is appropriate to the animal&rsquo;s type and training&mdash;fortunately, the feats on the list are appropriate for just about any animal. If the animal&rsquo;s Intelligence is 3 or higher (whether from using its ability score increase or a magic item), it can select any feat that it qualifies for. You should decide what feat it learns, subject to GM approval, although the creature&rsquo;s higher intelligence might mean it has its own ideas about what it wants to learn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As with feats, you should decide what skills your animal companion learns, chosen from the Animal Skills list and subject to GM approval. If the animal&rsquo;s Intelligence score is 3 or higher, it can put its ranks into any skill, with the GM&rsquo;s approval. Of course, the animal might not have the physical ability to perform certain skills (a dog can&rsquo;t create disguises, an elephant can&rsquo;t use the Ride skill, and so on).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ability score increases are straightforward when it comes to physical ability scores&mdash;training an animal to be stronger, more agile, or tougher are all reasonable tasks. Training an animal to be smarter, more intuitive, or more self-aware is less easy to justify&mdash;except in the context where people can cast spells and speak with animals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because you&rsquo;re responsible for using the Handle Animal skill to teach your companion its tricks, you decide what tricks the companion learns. If you&rsquo;re not skilled at training animals or lack the time to do it yourself, you can hire an expert trainer to do it for you or use the downtime system to take care of this training.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cohort</h2>\n<p>Advancement choices for a cohort include feats, skills, ability score increases, and class levels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A cohort is generally considered a player-controlled companion, and therefore you get to decide how the cohort advances. The GM might step in if you make choices that are inappropriate for the cohort, use the cohort as a mechanism for pushing the boundaries of the game rules, or treat the cohort unfairly. a cohort is a loyal companion and ally to you, and expects you to treat him fairly, generously, without aloofness or cruelty, and without devoting too much attention to other minions such as familiars or animal companions. The cohort&rsquo;s attitude toward you is generally helpful (as if using the Diplomacy skill); he complies with most of your requests without any sort of skill check, except for requests that are against his nature or put him in serious peril.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you exploit your cohort, you&rsquo;ll quickly find your Leadership score shrinking away. Although this doesn&rsquo;t change the cohort&rsquo;s level, the cohort can&rsquo;t gain levels until your Leadership score allows for a level increase, so if you&rsquo;re a poor leader, you must wait longer for your cohort to level up. In extreme cases, the cohort might abandon you, and you&rsquo;ll have to recruit a new cohort.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Examples of inappropriate advancement choices are a good-aligned companion selecting morally questionable feats, a clumsy cohort suddenly putting many ranks in Disable Device (so he can take all the risks in searching for traps instead of you), a spellcaster cohort taking nothing but item creation feats (so you get access to plenty of cheap magic items at the cost of just one feat, Leadership), a fighter cohort taking a level in wizard when he had no previous interest in magic, or you not interacting with your cleric cohort other than to gain defensive spells from a different class or a flanking bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you select the Leadership feat, you and the GM should discuss the cohort&rsquo;s background, personality, interests, and role in the campaign and party. Not only does this give the GM the opportunity to reject a cohort concept that goes against the theme of the campaign, but the GM can plan adventure hooks involving the cohort for future quests. The random background generator in Chapter 1 can help greatly when filling in details about the cohort. Once the discussion is done, writing down a biography and personality profile of the cohort helps cement his role in the campaign and provides a strong reference point for later talks about what is or is not appropriate advancement for the cohort.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Eidolon</h2>\n<p>Compared to an animal companion or cohort, an eidolon is a unique type of companion&mdash;it is intelligent and loyal to you, and you have absolute power over whether it is present in the material world or banished to its home plane. You literally have the power to reshape the eidolon&rsquo;s body using the transmogrify spell, and though technically the eidolon can resist this&mdash;the Saving Throw is &ldquo;Will negates (harmless)&rdquo;&mdash;it is assumed that the eidolon complies with what you want. After all, the eidolon can&rsquo;t actually be killed while summoned; at worst, it might experience pain before damage sends it back to its home plane. This means the eidolon is usually willing to take great risks to help you. If swimming through acid was the only way to save you, it would do so, knowing that it won&rsquo;t die and will recover. The eidolon is a subservient creature whose very nature depends upon your will, so you decide what feats, skill points, ability score increases, and evolutions the eidolon gains as it advances.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Follower</h2>\n<p>Because a follower is much lower level than you, it&rsquo;s generally not worth determining a follower&rsquo;s exact feats and skill ranks, as he would be ineffective against opponents appropriate for your level. In most cases, knowing the follower&rsquo;s name, gender, race, class, level, and profession is sufficient, such as &ldquo;Lars, male human expert 1, sailor.&rdquo; Since followers lack full stat blocks, the issue of advancing them is irrelevant. If your Leadership score improves, just add new followers rather than advancing existing ones. However, if events require advancing a follower (such as turning a follower into a cohort to replace a dead cohort), use the same guidelines as for cohorts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hirelings</h2>\n<p>Hirelings don&rsquo;t normally gain levels. If the GM is running a kingdom-building campaign where hireling NPCs are heavily involved, you might suggest ways for NPCs to advance, but the final decision is up to the GM. If you want more control over your hireling&rsquo;s feats, skills, and class levels, you should select that hireling as a follower with the Leadership feat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mounts</h2>\n<p>Common mounts (such as horses or riding dogs bought from a merchant, rather than mounts that are class features) don&rsquo;t normally advance. If extraordinary circumstances merit a mount gaining Hit Dice, and you have Handle Animal ranks and take an interest in training the animal, use the same guidelines as those for animal companions.</p>"}

Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light. This decrease does not apply to proficiency in wearing the armor. A character wearing mithral full plate must be proficient in wearing heavy armor to avoid adding the armor&rsquo;s check penalty on all his attack rolls and skill checks that involve moving. Spell failure chances for armors and shields made from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonuses are increased by 2, and armor check penalties are decreased by 3 (to a minimum of 0).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals. In the case of weapons, this lighter weight does not change a weapon&rsquo;s size category or the ease with which it can be wielded (whether it is light, one-handed, or two-handed). Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of mithral. (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while a quarterstaff cannot.)

When a creature wielding a melee weapon made of mindglass succeeds at a saving throw against a psychic or mind-affecting effect from a creature, the weapon stores some of that energy and holds it for a future attack. A mindglass weapon can store this energy for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell, or half the creature&rsquo;s CR if the effect wasn&rsquo;t a spell or spell-like ability. If the weapon hits a creature while still holding this energy, it suffuses the target with a disruptive field for 1 round. On a critical hit, the disruptive field effect instead lasts for a number of rounds equal to the weapon&rsquo;s critical multiplier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While affected by this field, a target must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 15 + twice the spell&rsquo;s level) to cast any spell or spell-like ability (in addition to any other required concentration checks). If the check is failed, the affected creature&rsquo;s spell or spell-like ability is wasted. A Small or Medium weapon made of mindglass costs an additional 13,000 gp.</p>"}

Designing Spells}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 134</em></p>\n<p>The description is the meat of the spell, and what you put here is the most important information of all.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Make sure the spell description is clear and concise. Remember that players are going to refer to the spell description in a hurry during their turn of combat, and if they have to fight their way through flowery language to figure out the details, the resulting delay will annoy other players and the GM. If the spell has several complex effects, put each effect into its own paragraph. If the spell allows the caster to choose from several options, put each option on its own line with an italicized name (see binding for an example).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anything that appears in the spell stat block doesn&rsquo;t need to appear again in the spell description&mdash;it&rsquo;s redundant. For example, the fireball description doesn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;The spell can reach up to 400 feet plus 40 feet per caster level.&rdquo; Extraneous text like that is just more clutter for the player to sift through when looking up the spell&rsquo;s effects in the middle of combat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Avoid using language that implies something that the game mechanics of the spell don&rsquo;t back up. For example, a spell&rsquo;s description shouldn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;using the foul powers of necromancy&rdquo; if the spell doesn&rsquo;t actually have some sort of evil effect or the evil descriptor. This sort of mistake is most common with necromancy spells, which include not only many obviously evil spells, but also a fair share of helpful ones as well (such as astral projection, gentle repose, and undeath to death). People who read your spell description may not know your intent, and using flavorful language can trick readers into thinking a spell should have additional effects not explicitly spelled out in the description.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Remember that while you may be designing a spell with a particular character or class in mind, most spells are going to have a broader availability. You have to think of the spell in the hands of the biggest power gamer, and in use by a character who is very different than the one for whom it is designed. Even a simple sorcerer/wizard spell has to deal with two different types of casters: a wizard, who can learn many spells but can only cast a few per day, and a sorcerer, who knows few spells but can cast many per day. A spell that is good for a wizard may be too good when used by a sorcerer because the sorcerer can use it more times per day. Likewise, think of what happens if the PCs can access the spell in potion or scroll form&mdash;you may intend for the spell to be rare and for the PCs to not have it most of the time, but a wizard can create scrolls of rarely used spells and save them for just the right opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you finish writing a spell description, have others look it over. They&rsquo;ll notice things you missed, come up with questions your spell needs to address, and find ways your spell can be abused. Use that feedback to revise the spell.</p>"}

Reviving and Replacing Companions}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>There are several ways to make sure a companion doesn&rsquo;t get lost or forgotten.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Props</h2>\n<p>Physical props can help you, the other players, and the GM remember companions. If the campaign uses miniatures on the tabletop, the companion should have its own miniature or token. If all the adventurers move forward, it&rsquo;s easy to see that a lonely miniature was left behind. Even without miniatures, having a physical representation of the companion on the tabletop keeps it in mind. Whether this is a stuffed animal, a toy, an action figure, a cardboard stand-up, a GameMastery Face Card, or a simple character sheet with a colorful illustration, this kind of reminder gives the companion a presence on the tabletop.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Another Player</h2>\n<p>If you regularly forget the presence of your companion and the GM is busy dealing with the rest of the game, another player can take over playing the companion. If the second player has an introverted character or one whose actions in combat are fast and efficient, allowing that player to control the companion gives him another opportunity to have some time in the spotlight. The second player should roll initiative separately for the companion so the companion&rsquo;s actions don&rsquo;t get forgotten on either turn&mdash;giving the companion its own turn reinforces its role in the party.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Allowing another character to play the companion also gives the group additional roleplaying opportunities. You might feel silly talking as both your character and your cohort, but more comfortable having a dialogue with your cohort when it&rsquo;s played by someone else (this also keeps the cohort from blindly doing whatever you say). Wearing a hat or mask, or holding up a small flag or banner to represent the companion can help other players keep track of who is acting when you speak.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Casual Observer</h2>\n<p>Some gaming groups have a casual player, friend, spouse, or child who isn&rsquo;t interested in playing a normal character for the campaign, but likes to watch the game or be nearby when everyone else is playing. That person might be interested in playing a companion for one or more sessions (especially if it&rsquo;s a creature that&rsquo;s funny and cute). This is an opportunity for that person to get involved in the game without the responsibility of being a full contributing member to the group&mdash;and just might be the hook that convinces that observer to become active in the game.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If playing a companion goes well, the GM may create a one-shot spin-off adventure in which all the players play companion creatures instead of normal PCs (perhaps because the PCs are captured, incapacitated, or merely sleeping), returning to the normal campaign when that adventure is completed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Often, a companion is forgotten about when it&rsquo;s not needed. a familiar hides in a backpack and only comes out when the sorcerer needs to spy on something or deliver a spell with a range of touch. An animal companion or cohort follows the druid silently and acts only when a skill check or attack roll is needed. An eidolon is used as a mount or an expendable resource in battle. You and the GM need to remember that a companion is a creature, not an unthinking tool, and can&rsquo;t simply be ignored.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Followers are a little more complex because there can be so many of them and they don&rsquo;t usually adventure with you. You and the GM should keep notes about each follower (or group of followers, if there are several in a common location such as a temple) and link this information to the followers&rsquo; base of operations. For example, the GM&rsquo;s notes about the capital city should mention the thieves&rsquo; guild informant follower of the rogue PC. Artwork representing the follower (even a simple piece of free clip art found online) can be a stronger reminder than a name that&rsquo;s easily lost in a page full of words.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Followers also have a unique companion role in that they spend most of their time away from you, and might use that time positively or negatively. Just because a follower is low level and you&rsquo;re not doesn&rsquo;t mean the follower stops being a person with needs, fears, and a role to play in your heroic story. Even if you dismiss the follower aspect of the Leadership feat as baggage, a follower is going to pay attention to what you do, and if this hero-worship grows tarnished from neglect or abuse, that very same follower provides an opportunity for the GM to demonstrate how bad will among the common folk can negatively affect an adventurer&rsquo;s life (see the Reputation section of this chapter for more information).</p>"}

Intelligent magic items with a special purpose gain a +2 Ego bonus. An item&rsquo;s purpose must suit the type and alignment of the item and should always be treated reasonably. A purpose of &ldquo;defeat/slay arcane spellcasters&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean that the sword forces the wielder to kill every wizard she sees. Nor does it mean that the sword believes it is possible to kill every wizard, sorcerer, and bard in the world. It does mean that the item hates arcane spellcasters and wants to bring the local wizards&rsquo; cabal to ruin, as well as end the rule of a sorcererqueen in a nearby land. Likewise, a purpose of &ldquo;defend elves&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean that if the wielder is an elf, he only wants to help the wielder. It means that the item wants to be used in furthering the cause of elves, stamping out their enemies and aiding their leaders. A purpose of &ldquo;defeat/slay all&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t just a matter of self-preservation. It means that the item won&rsquo;t rest (or let its wielder rest) until it places itself above all others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Table 15&ndash;25 has a number of sample purposes that a magic item might possess. If the wielder specifically ignores or goes against an intelligent item&rsquo;s special purpose, the item gains a +4 bonus to its Ego until the wielder cooperates.

Slimes, Molds, and Fungi}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 415</em></p>\n<p>In a dungeon&rsquo;s damp, dark recesses, molds and fungi thrive. For purposes of spells and other special effects, all slimes, molds, and fungi are treated as plants. Like traps, dangerous slimes and molds have CRs, and characters earn XP for encountering them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A form of glistening organic sludge coats almost anything that remains in the damp and dark for too long. This kind of slime, though it might be repulsive, is not dangerous. Molds and fungi flourish in dark, cool, damp places. While some are as inoffensive as the normal dungeon slime, others are quite dangerous. Mushrooms, puff balls, yeasts, mildew, and other sorts of bulbous, fibrous, or flat patches of fungi can be found throughout most dungeons. They are usually inoffensive, and some are even edible (although most are unappealing or odd-tasting).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Brown Mold (CR 2)</h2>\n<p>Brown mold feeds on warmth, drawing heat from anything around it. It normally comes in patches 5 feet in diameter, and the temperature is always cold in a 30-foot radius around it. Living creatures within 5 feet of it take 3d6 points of nonlethal cold damage. Fire brought within 5 feet of brown mold causes the mold to instantly double in size. Cold damage, such as from a cone of cold, instantly destroys it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Green Slime (CR 4)</h2>\n<p>This dungeon peril is a dangerous variety of normal slime. Green slime devours flesh and organic materials on contact and is even capable of dissolving metal. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches, reproducing as it consumes organic matter. It drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement (and possible food) below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A single 5-foot square of green slime deals 1d6 points of Constitution damage per round while it devours flesh. On the first round of contact, the slime can be scraped off a creature (destroying the scraping device), but after that it must be frozen, burned, or cut away (dealing damage to the victim as well). Anything that deals cold or fire damage, sunlight, or a remove disease spell destroys a patch of green slime. Against wood or metal, green slime deals 2d6 points of damage per round, ignoring metal&rsquo;s hardness but not that of wood. It does not harm stone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Phosphorescent Fungus</h2>\n<p>This strange underground fungus gives off a soft violet glow that illuminates underground caverns and passages as well as a candle does. Rare patches of fungus illuminate as well as a torch does.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shrieker</h2>\n<p>This human-sized purple mushroom emits a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds whenever there is movement or a light source within 10 feet. This shriek makes it impossible to hear any other sound within 50 feet. The sound attracts nearby creatures that are disposed to investigate it. Some creatures that live near shriekers learn that this noise means there is food or an intruder nearby.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Yellow Mold (CR 6)</h2>\n<p>If disturbed, a 5-foot square of this mold bursts forth with a cloud of poisonous spores. All within 10 feet of the mold must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or take 1d3 points of Constitution damage. Another DC 15 Fortitude save is required once per round for the next 5 rounds, to avoid taking 1d3 points of Constitution damage each round. A successful Fortitude save ends this effect. Fire destroys yellow mold, and sunlight renders it dormant.</p>"}

The relevant ability for most divine spells is Wisdom (Charisma for paladins). To prepare a divine spell, a character must have a Wisdom score (or Charisma score for paladins) of 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. Likewise, bonus spells are based on Wisdom.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Time of Day</h2>\n<p>A divine spellcaster chooses and prepares spells ahead of time, but unlike a wizard, does not require a period of rest to prepare spells. Instead, the character chooses a particular time of day to pray and receive spells. The time is usually associated with some daily event. If some event prevents a character from praying at the proper time, she must do so as soon as possible. If the character does not stop to pray for spells at the first opportunity, she must wait until the next day to prepare spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Selection and Preparation</h2>\n<p>A divine spellcaster selects and prepares spells ahead of time through prayer and meditation at a particular time of day. The time required to prepare spells is the same as it is for a wizard (1 hour), as is the requirement for a relatively peaceful environment. When preparing spells for the day, a divine spellcaster can leave some of her spell slots open. Later during that day, she can repeat the preparation process as often as she likes. During these extra sessions of preparation, she can fill these unused spell slots. She cannot, however, abandon a previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a slot that is empty because she has cast a spell in the meantime. Like the first session of the day, this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes longer if she prepares more than one-quarter of her spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Divine spellcasters do not require spellbooks. However, a divine spellcaster&rsquo;s spell selection is limited to the spells on the list for her class. Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers have separate spell lists. A cleric also has access to two domains determined during character creation. Each domain gives her access to a number of special abilities and bonus spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Slots</h2>\n<p>The character class tables show how many spells of each level each can cast per day. These openings for daily spells are called spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-level spell slot with a lowerlevel spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability score to cast spells that would otherwise be her due still gets the slots but must fill them with spells of lower levels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Recent Casting Limit</h2>\n<p>As with arcane spells, at the time of preparation any spells cast within the previous 8 hours count against the number of spells that can be prepared.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spontaneous Casting of Cure and Inflict Spells</h2>\n<p>A good cleric (or a cleric of a good deity) can spontaneously cast a cure spell in place of a prepared spell of the same level or higher, but not in place of a bonus domain spell. An evil cleric (or a cleric of an evil deity) can spontaneously cast an inflict spell in place of a prepared spell (that is not a domain spell) of the same level or higher. Each neutral cleric of a neutral deity spontaneously casts either cure spells like a good cleric or inflict spells like an evil one, depending on which option the player chooses when creating the character. The divine energy of the spell that the cure or inflict spell substitutes for is converted into the cure or inflict spell as if that spell had been prepared all along.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spontaneous Casting of Summon Nature&rsquo;s Ally Spells</h2>\n<p>A druid can spontaneously cast summon nature&rsquo;s ally in place of a prepared spell of the same level or higher. The divine energy of the spell that the summon spell substitutes for is converted as if that spell had been prepared all along.</p>"}

Even those for whom silver presents no danger avoid its touch whenever possible. Binders who want to deal with infernal outsiders as putative allies keep these substances at least 60 feet from the summoning circle; however, if they wish to threaten their infernal subjects, they keep them close at hand. The powdered silver used to create the magic circle is a warning and a trap, but it is not an overt threat&mdash;summoned devils recognize it as part of the procedure to call them to the Material Plane. Note that even silver candlesticks or bells can be used as weapons of opportunity, but the best defense, should the wizard choose to display force, is a weapon bonded with alchemical silver.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An even better defense against devils, however, is a holy weapon. As with demons, a holy weapon is strong enough to drive through any devil&rsquo;s natural defenses, and the presence of such an item in the summoning chamber is an affront to more powerful or subtle devils.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note that all devils are immune to fire and poison; the blasted landscapes of their home plane quickly destroy any who show vulnerabilities to these effects. All devils can withstand acid and cold as well, though to varying degrees, and few of them show any fear of suffering that damage. They have resistance to acid 10 and cold 10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, one can enhance summoning for specific kinds of devils by appealing to those devils&rsquo; specific natures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Accuser Devil</h2>\n<p>Popular among conjurers and summoners as spies and infiltrators, accuser devils often forgo haggling on gifts for their services, as the information they gain is worth more than any gift of treasure the binder can offer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Barbed Devil (SR 22)</h2>\n<p>Extraordinarily jealous of their duties and even more so of their time, barbed devils may grudgingly accept offers of rare treasures and gems worth more than 2,000 gp, with the usual +2 Charisma bonus to summoning&mdash;but only when the task takes less than 24 hours to complete. If the service takes any longer, the binder takes a &ndash;2 Charisma penalty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bearded Devil (SR 16)</h2>\n<p>The best way to attract the eye of a bearded devil is to offer a restrained victim for its bloody use, so that it might painfully murder its target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Belier Devil (SR 28)</h2>\n<p>These massive masterminds are rarely summoned to the Material Plane, but when they are, they often try to finagle their way out of such circumstances as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bone Devil (SR 20)</h2>\n<p>These devils adore secrets and infernal lore, and those who provide hellish tomes or evidence of influential mortal vices gain a +2 Charisma bonus on their summoning checks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Erinyes (SR 19)</h2>\n<p>As the spirits of corrupted angels, erinyes are bitter and rage against the heavens. To entice an erinyes, offer it a significant holy item for it to despoil, or the cleric of a good-aligned god to ravish and ruin.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Handmaiden Devil (SR 25)</h2>\n<p>Deals made with handmaiden devils are often extremely hard bargains. They typically ask for the unthinkable, such as the lives of innocent children&mdash;the younger the better.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Horned Devil (SR 27)</h2>\n<p>As the elite of Hell&rsquo;s armies, horned devils value strength and daunting power; anyone who offers them an intimidating weapon enchanted to +2 or better gains the +2 Charisma bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ice Devil (SR 24)</h2>\n<p>As the schemers and planners of Hell&rsquo;s devils, laboring in their personal machinations, gelugons are extraordinarily difficult to summon. However, casters willing to offer an exchange of services&mdash;one in which the caster is likely to see the short end of the deal&mdash;may earn a Charisma bonus. Those who renege on their bargains with gelugons often learn what it means to displease Hell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Immolation Devil (SR 30)</h2>\n<p>These devils often ask for lands on the Material Plane as gifts. If such lands are granted, they use these places to launch attacks on neighbors, further expanding the territory of Hell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Imp</h2>\n<p>Imps prefer small and bloody sacrifices that show the binder&rsquo;s desire to do evil&mdash;for instance, a heart torn from a living dove grants a +2 Charisma modifier on the summoning check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lemure</h2>\n<p>Lemures prefer reminders of their former lives, and so the best offering is food or pornography.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pit Fiend (SR 31)</h2>\n<p>Pit fiends, the greatest of all the nonnoble devils in Hell, are rarely tempted to answer a summons; when called, most of them come to see the stupidity or the arrogance that brought them to the Material Plane before snatching the wizard away for an eternity of torment. Only the greatest of promises, such as a noble offering the enslavement of an entire empire, a priest offering the destruction of holy relics, or an antipaladin pledging the delivery of a helpless and noteworthy angel for the pit fiend&rsquo;s pleasure, might induce the pit fiend into service.</p>"}

Miscellaneous Trap Features}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 417</em></p>\n<p>A reset element is the set of conditions under which a trap becomes ready to trigger again. Resetting a trap usually takes only a minute or so. For a trap with a more difficult reset method, you should set the time and labor required.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>No Reset</h2>\n<p>Short of completely rebuilding the trap, there&rsquo;s no way to trigger it more than once. Spell traps have no reset element.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Repair</h2>\n<p>To get the trap functioning again, you must repair it. Repairing a mechanical trap requires a Craft (traps) check against a DC equal to the one for building it. The cost for raw materials is one-fifth of the trap&rsquo;s original market price. To calculate how long it takes to fix a trap, use the same calculations you would for building it, but use the cost of the raw materials required for repair in place of the market price.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Manual</h2>\n<p>Resetting the trap requires someone to move the parts back into place. This is the kind of reset element most mechanical traps have.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Automatic</h2>\n<p>The trap resets itself, either immediately or after a timed interval. Bypass (Optional Element) If the builder of a trap wants to be able to move past the trap after it is created or placed, it&rsquo;s a good idea to build in a bypass mechanism: something that temporarily disarms the trap. Bypass elements are typically used only with mechanical traps; spell traps usually have built-in allowances for the caster to bypass them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lock</h2>\n<p>A lock bypass requires a DC 30 Disable Device check to open.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hidden Switch</h2>\n<p>A hidden switch requires a DC 25 Perception check to locate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hidden Lock</h2>\n<p>A hidden lock combines the features above, requiring a DC 25 Perception check to locate and a DC 30 Disable Device check to open. Effect The effect of a trap is what happens to those who spring it. This often takes the form of either damage or a spell effect, but some traps have special effects. A trap usually either makes an attack roll or forces a saving throw to avoid it. Occasionally a trap uses both of these options, or neither (see Never Miss).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pits</h2>\n<p>These are holes (covered or not) that characters can fall into, causing them to take damage. A pit needs no attack roll, but a successful Reflex save (DC set by the builder) avoids it. Other save-dependent mechanical traps also fall into this category. Falling into a pit deals 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet of depth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pits in dungeons come in three basic varieties: uncovered, covered, and chasms. Pits and chasms can be defeated by judicious application of the Acrobatics skill, the Climb skill, or various mechanical or magical means.</p>\n<p>Uncovered pits and natural chasms serve mainly to discourage intruders from going a certain way, although they cause much grief to characters who stumble into them in the dark, and they can greatly complicate nearby melee.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Covered pits are much more dangerous. They can be detected with a DC 20 Perception check, but only if the character is taking the time to carefully examine the area before walking across it. A character who fails to detect a covered pit is still entitled to a DC 20 Reflex save to avoid falling into it. If she was running or moving recklessly at the time, however, she gets no saving throw and falls automatically.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trap coverings can be as simple as piled refuse (straw, leaves, sticks, garbage), a large rug, or an actual trap door concealed to appear as a normal part of the floor. Such a trap door usually swings open when enough weight (usually about 50 to 80 pounds) is placed upon it. Devious trap builders sometimes design trap doors so they spring back shut after they open. The trap door might lock once it&rsquo;s back in place, leaving the stranded character well and truly trapped. Opening such a trap door is just as difficult as opening a regular door (assuming the trapped character can reach it), and a DC 13 Strength check is needed to keep a spring-loaded door open.</p>\n<p>Pit traps often have something nastier than just a hard floor at the bottom. A trap designer might put spikes, monsters, or a pool of acid, lava, or even water at the bottom. For rules on pit spikes and other such add-ons, see the Miscellaneous Trap Features section.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Monsters sometimes live in pits. Any monster that can fit into the pit might have been placed there by the dungeon&rsquo;s designer, or might simply have fallen in and not been able to climb back out.</p>\n<p>A secondary trap, mechanical or magical, at the bottom of a pit can be particularly deadly. Activated by a falling victim, the secondary trap attacks the already injured character when she&rsquo;s least ready for it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ranged Attack Traps</h2>\n<p>These traps f ling darts, arrows, spears, or the like at whomever activated the trap. The builder sets the attack bonus. A ranged attack trap can be configured to simulate the effect of a composite bow with a high Strength rating, which provides the trap with a bonus on damage equal to its Strength rating. These traps deal whatever damage their ammunition normally does. If a trap is constructed with a high Strength rating, it has a corresponding bonus on damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Melee Attack Traps</h2>\n<p>These traps feature such obstacles as sharp blades that emerge from walls and stone blocks that fall from ceilings. Once again, the builder sets the attack bonus. These traps deal the same damage as the melee weapons they &ldquo;wield.&rdquo; In the case of a falling stone block, you can assign any amount of bludgeoning damage you like, but remember that whoever resets the trap has to lift that stone back into place.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A melee attack trap can be constructed with a built-in bonus on damage rolls, just as if the trap itself had a high Strength score.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Traps</h2>\n<p>Spell traps produce the spell&rsquo;s effect. Like all spells, a spell trap that allows a saving throw has a save DC of 10 + spell level + caster&rsquo;s relevant ability modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Device Traps</h2>\n<p>These traps produce the effects of any spells included in their construction, as described in the appropriate entries. If the spell in a magic device trap allows a saving throw, its save DC is (10 + spell level) &times; 1.5. Some spells make attack rolls instead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Special</h2>\n<p>Some traps have miscellaneous features that produce special effects, such as drowning for a water trap or ability damage for poison. Saving throws and damage depend on the poison or are set by the builder, as appropriate.</p>"}

Magic Item Creation}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 460</em></p>\n<p>Each general type of magic item gets an overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>General descriptions include notes on activation, random generation, and other material. The AC, hardness, hit points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some magic items. The AC assumes that the item is unattended and includes a &ndash;5 penalty for the item&rsquo;s effective Dexterity of 0. If a creature holds the item, use the creature&rsquo;s Dexterity modifier in place of the &ndash;5 penalty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some individual items, notably those that just store spells, don&rsquo;t get full-blown descriptions. Reference the spell&rsquo;s description for details, modif ied by the form of the item (potion, scroll, wand, and so on). Assume that the spell is cast at the minimum level required to cast it. Items with full descriptions have their powers detailed, and each of the following topics is covered in notational form as part of its entry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Aura</h2>\n<p>Most of the time, a detect magic spell reveals the school of magic associated with a magic item and the strength of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable) is given at the beginning of the item&rsquo;s notational entry. See the detect magic spell description for details.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Caster Level (CL)</h2>\n<p>The next item in a notational entry gives the caster level of the item, indicating its relative power. The caster level determines the item&rsquo;s saving throw bonus, as well as range or other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable). It also determines the level that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a dispel magic spell or similar situation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For potions, scrolls, and wands, the creator can set the caster level of an item at any number high enough to cast the stored spell but not higher than her own caster level. For other magic items, the caster level is determined by the item itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Slot</h2>\n<p>Most magic items can only be utilized if worn or wielded in their proper slots. If the item is stowed or placed elsewhere, it does not function. If the slot lists &ldquo;none,&rdquo; the item must be held or otherwise carried to function.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Price</h2>\n<p>This is the cost, in gold pieces, to purchase the item, if it is available for sale. Generally speaking, magic items can be sold by PCs for half this value.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Weight</h2>\n<p>This is the weight of an item. When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting (for purposes of determining how much of a load a character can carry).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>This section of a magic item describes the item&rsquo;s powers and abilities. Potions, scrolls, staves, and wands refer to various spells as part of their descriptions (see Chapter 10 for details on these spells).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Construction</h2>\n<p>With the exception of artifacts, most magic items can be built by a spellcaster with the appropriate feats and prerequisites. This section describes those prerequisites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n<p>Certain requirements must be met in order for a character to create a magic item. These include feats, spells, and miscellaneous requirements such as level, alignment, and race or kind.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A spell prerequisite may be provided by a character who has prepared the spell (or who knows the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard), or through the use of a spell completion or spell trigger magic item or a spell-like ability that produces the desired spell effect. For each day that passes in the creation process, the creator must expend one spell completion item or one charge from a spell trigger item if either of those objects is used to supply a prerequisite.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the purpose of determinations where the creator&rsquo;s level must be known.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cost</h2>\n<p>This is the cost in gold pieces to create the item. Generally this cost is equal to half the price of an item, but additional material components might increase this number. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the costs of the components.</p>"}

Your saving throw modifier is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Base save bonus + ability modifier</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Saving Throw Types</h2>\n<p>The three different kinds of saving throws are Fortitude, Reflex, and Will:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Fortitude</strong>: These saves measure your ability to stand up to physical punishment or attacks against your vitality and health. Apply your Constitution modifier to your Fortitude saving throws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Reflex:</strong> These saves test your ability to dodge area attacks and unexpected situations. Apply your Dexterity modifier to your Reflex saving throws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Will</strong>: These saves ref lect your resistance to mental influence as well as many magical effects. Apply your Wisdom modifier to your Will saving throws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Saving Throw Difficulty Class</h2>\n<p>The DC for a save is determined by the attack itself.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Automatic Failures and Successes</h2>\n<p>A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always a failure (and may cause damage to exposed items; see Items Surviving after a Saving Throw on page 217).

Magic Item Creation}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 477</em></p>\n<p>A potion is a magic liquid that produces its effect when imbibed. Potions vary incredibly in appearance. Magic oils are similar to potions, except that oils are applied externally rather than imbibed. A potion or oil can be used only once. It can duplicate the effect of a spell of up to 3rd level that has a casting time of less than 1 minute and targets one or more creatures or objects. The price of a potion is equal to the level of the spell &times; the creator&rsquo;s caster level &times; 50 gp. If the potion has a material component cost, it is added to the base price and cost to create. Table 15&ndash;12 gives sample prices for potions created at the lowest possible caster level for each spellcasting class. Note that some spells appear at different levels for different casters. The level of such spells depends on the caster brewing the potion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Potions are like spells cast upon the imbiber. The character taking the potion doesn&rsquo;t get to make any decisions about the effect&mdash;the caster who brewed the potion has already done so. The drinker of a potion is both the effective target and the caster of the effect (though the potion indicates the caster level, the drinker still controls the effect).</p>\n<p>The person applying an oil is the effective caster, but the object is the target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>A typical potion or oil consists of 1 ounce of liquid held in a ceramic or glass vial fitted with a tight stopper. The stoppered container is usually no more than 1 inch wide and 2 inches high. The vial has AC 13, 1 hit point, hardness 1, and a break DC of 12.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Identifying Potions</h2>\n<p>In addition to the standard methods of identification, PCs can sample from each container they find to attempt to determine the nature of the liquid inside with a Perception check. The DC of this check is equal to 15 + the spell level of the potion (although this DC might be higher for rare or unusual potions).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Activation</h2>\n<p>Drinking a potion or applying an oil requires no special skill. The user merely removes the stopper and swallows the potion or smears on the oil. The following rules govern potion and oil use.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drinking a potion or using an oil is a standard action. The potion or oil takes effect immediately. Using a potion or oil provokes attacks of opportunity. An enemy may direct an attack of opportunity against the potion or oil container rather than against the character. A successful attack of this sort can destroy the container, preventing the character from drinking the potion or applying the oil.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A creature must be able to swallow a potion or smear on an oil. Because of this, incorporeal creatures cannot use potions or oils. Any corporeal creature can imbibe a potion or use an oil.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A character can carefully administer a potion to an unconscious creature as a full-round action, trickling the liquid down the creature&rsquo;s throat. Likewise, it takes a full-round action to apply an oil to an unconscious creature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 15-12: Potions</h2>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">Minor</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Medium</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Major</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Spell Level</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Caster Level</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>01-20</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21-60</td>\n<td>01-20</td>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>61-100</td>\n<td>21-60</td>\n<td>01-20</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&mdash;</td>\n<td>61-100</td>\n<td>21-100</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Potion Costs</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 97.3684%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6932%;\" scope=\"col\">Spell Level</td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.5765%;\" scope=\"col\">Cleric, Druid, Wizard</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.9386%;\" scope=\"col\">Sorcerer</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.1955%;\" scope=\"col\">Bard</td>\n<td style=\"width: 24.3243%;\" scope=\"col\">Paladin, Ranger</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6932%;\">0</td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.5765%;\">25 gp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.9386%;\">25 gp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.1955%;\">25 gp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 24.3243%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6932%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.5765%;\">50 gp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.9386%;\">50 gp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.1955%;\">50 gp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 24.3243%;\">50 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6932%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.5765%;\">300 gp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.9386%;\">400 gp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.1955%;\">400 gp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 24.3243%;\">400 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 16.6932%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 26.5765%;\">750 gp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 17.9386%;\">900 gp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 13.1955%;\">1,050 gp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 24.3243%;\">1,050 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

Breaking and Entering}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 171</em></p>\n<p>Characters covering long distances cross-country use overland movement. Overland movement is measured in miles per hour or miles per day. A day represents 8 hours of actual travel time. For rowed watercraft, a day represents 10 hours of rowing. For a sailing ship, it represents 24 hours.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Walk</h2>\n<p>A character can walk 8 hours in a day of travel without a problem. Walking for longer than that can wear him out (see Forced March, below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hustle</h2>\n<p>A character can hustle for 1 hour without a problem. Hustling for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 point of nonlethal damage, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour of hustling. A character who takes any nonlethal damage from hustling becomes fatigued.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A fatigued character can&rsquo;t run or charge and takes a penalty of &ndash;2 to Strength and Dexterity. Eliminating the nonlethal damage also eliminates the fatigue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Run</h2>\n<p>A character can&rsquo;t run for an extended period of time. Attempts to run and rest in cycles effectively work out to a hustle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Terrain</h2>\n<p>The terrain through which a character travels affects the distance he can cover in an hour or a day (see Table 7&ndash;8). A highway is a straight, major, paved road. A road is typically a dirt track. A trail is like a road, except that it allows only single-file travel and does not benefit a party traveling with vehicles. Trackless terrain is a wild area with no paths.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Forced March</h2>\n<p>In a day of normal walking, a character walks for 8 hours. The rest of the daylight time is spent making and breaking camp, resting, and eating.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A character can walk for more than 8 hours in a day by making a forced march. For each hour of marching beyond 8 hours, a Constitution check (DC 10, +2 per extra hour) is required. If the check fails, the character takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. A character who takes any nonlethal damage from a forced march becomes fatigued. Eliminating the nonlethal damage also eliminates the fatigue. It&rsquo;s possible for a character to march into unconsciousness by pushing himself too hard.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mounted Movement</h2>\n<p>A mount bearing a rider can move at a hustle. The damage it takes when doing so, however, is lethal damage, not nonlethal damage. The creature can also be ridden in a forced march, but its Constitution checks automatically fail, and the damage it takes is lethal damage. Mounts also become fatigued when they take any damage from hustling or forced marches.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See Table 7&ndash;9: Mounts and Vehicles for mounted speeds and speeds for vehicles pulled by draft animals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Waterborne Movement</h2>\n<p>See Table 7&ndash;9: Mounts and Vehicles for speeds for water vehicles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 7-8: Terrain and Overland Movement</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 74.0085%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 31.7397%;\" scope=\"col\">Terrain</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;

By doing so, you are using the spell&rsquo;s energy to disrupt the casting of the same spell by another character. Counterspelling works even if one spell is divine and the other arcane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>How Counterspells Work</h2>\n<p>To use a counterspell, you must select an opponent as the target of the counterspell. You do this by choosing to ready an action (see Combat). In doing so, you elect to wait to complete your action until your opponent tries to cast a spell. You may still move at your normal speed, since ready is a standard action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the target of your counterspell tries to cast a spell, make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the spell&rsquo;s level). This check is a free action. If the check succeeds, you correctly identify the opponent&rsquo;s spell and can attempt to counter it. If the check fails, you can&rsquo;t do either of these things.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To complete the action, you must then cast an appropriate spell. As a general rule, a spell can only counter itself. If you are able to cast the same spell and you have it prepared (or have a slot of the appropriate level available), you cast it, creating a counterspell effect. If the target is within range, both spells automatically negate each other with no other results.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Counterspelling Metamagic Spells</h2>\n<p>Metamagic feats are not taken into account when determining whether a spell can be countered.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Specific Exceptions</h2>\n<p>Some spells can counter other specific spells, often those with diametrically opposed effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dispel Magic as a Counterspell</h2>\n<p>You can usually use dispel magic to counterspell another spell being cast without needing to identify the spell being cast. Dispel magic doesn&rsquo;t always work as a counterspell (see the spell description).</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf1.spells.gmgwyjfpeuuc4t4o]{Dispel Magic}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf1.spells.e5kw4dwf9qwty6tl]{Dispel Magic, Greater}</p>"}

Poison}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 557</em></p>\n<p>No other affliction is so prevalent as poison. From the fangs of a viper to the ichor-stained assassin&rsquo;s blade, poison is a constant threat. Poisons can be cured by successful saving throws and spells such as neutralize poison.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.JVfKSrNbjsGdNaC5]{2.10.03.4.1. List of Poisons}</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Types of Poison</h2>\n<p>Contact poisons are contracted the moment someone touches the poison with his bare skin. Such poisons can be used as injury poisons. Contact poisons usually have an onset time of 1 minute and a frequency of 1 minute. Ingested poisons are contracted when a creature eats or drinks the poison. Ingested poisons usually have an onset time of 10 minutes and a frequency of 1 minute. Injury poisons are primarily contracted through the attacks of certain creatures and through weapons coated in the toxin.</p>\n<p>Injury poisons do not usually have an onset time and have a frequency of 1 round. Inhaled poisons are contracted the moment a creature enters an area containing such poisons. Most inhaled poisons fill a volume equal to a 10-foot cube per dose. Creatures can attempt to hold their breaths while inside to avoid inhaling the toxin. Creatures holding their breaths receive a 50% chance of not having to make a Fortitude save each round.&nbsp;See the rules for holding your breath and suffocation in Chapter 13. Note that a character that would normally suffocate while attempting to hold its breath instead begins to breathe normally again.</p>\n<h2>Multiple Doses</h2>\n<p>Unlike other afflictions, multiple doses of the same poison stack. Poisons delivered by injury and contact cannot inflict more than one dose of poison at a time, but inhaled and ingested poisons can inf lict multiple doses at once. Each additional dose extends the total duration of the poison (as noted under frequency) by half its total duration. In addition, each dose of poison increases the DC to resist the poison by +2. This increase is cumulative.</p>\n<p>Multiple doses do not alter the cure conditions of the poison, and meeting these conditions ends the affliction for all the doses. For example, a character is bit three times in the same round by a trio of Medium monstrous spiders, injecting him with three doses of Medium spider venom. The unfortunate character must make a DC 18 Fortitude save for the next 8 rounds. Fortunately, just one successful save cures the character of all three doses of the poison.</p>\n<h2>Applying Poison</h2>\n<p>Applying poison to a weapon or single piece of ammunition is a standard action. Whenever a character applies or readies a poison for use there is a 5% chance that he exposes himself to the poison and must save against the poison as normal. This does not consume the dose of poison. Whenever a character attacks with a poisoned weapon, if the attack roll results in a natural 1, he exposes himself to the poison. This poison is consumed when the weapon strikes a creature or is touched by the wielder. Characters with the poison use class feature do not risk accidentally poisoning themselves.</p>\n<h2>Crafting Poisons</h2>\n<p>Poisons can be made using Craft (alchemy). The DC to make a poison is equal to its Fortitude save DC. Rolling a natural 1 on a Craft skill check while making a poison exposes the crafter to the poison. Crafters with the poison use class feature do not risk poisoning themselves when using Craft to make poison.</p>"}

A typical small city wall is a fortified stone wall 5 feet thick and 20 feet high. Such a wall is fairly smooth, requiring a DC 30 Climb check to scale. The walls are crenellated on one side to provide a low wall for the guards atop it, and there is just barely room for guards to walk along the top of the wall. A typical small city wall has AC 3, hardness 8, and 450 hp per 10-foot section.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A typical large city wall is 10 feet thick and 30 feet high, with crenellations on both sides for the guards on top of the wall. It is likewise smooth, requiring a DC 30 Climb check to scale. Such a wall has AC 3, hardness 8, and 720 hp per 10-foot section.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A typical metropolis wall is 15 feet thick and 40 feet tall. It has crenellations on both sides and often has a tunnel and small rooms running through its interior. Metropolis walls have AC 3, hardness 8, and 1,170 hp per 10-foot section.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unlike smaller cities, metropolises often have interior walls as well as surrounding walls&mdash;either old walls that the city has outgrown, or walls dividing individual districts from each other. Sometimes these walls are as large and thick as the outer walls, but more often they have the characteristics of a large city&rsquo;s or small city&rsquo;s walls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Watchtowers</h2>\n<p>Some city walls are adorned with watchtowers set at irregular intervals. Few cities have enough guards to keep someone constantly stationed at every tower, unless the city is expecting attack from outside. The towers provide a superior view of the surrounding countryside as well as a point of defense against invaders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Watchtowers are typically 10 feet higher than the wall they adjoin, and their diameter is 5 times the thickness of the wall. Arrow slits line the outer sides of the upper stories of a tower, and the top is crenellated like the surrounding walls are. In a small tower (25 feet in diameter adjoining a 5-foot-thick wall), a simple ladder typically connects the tower&rsquo;s stories and its roof. In a larger tower, stairs serve that purpose.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Heavy wooden doors, reinforced with iron and bearing good locks (Disable Device DC 30), block entry to a tower, unless the tower is in regular use. As a rule, the captain of the guard keeps the keys to the towers secured on her person, and second copies are in the city&rsquo;s inner fortress or barracks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Gates</h2>\n<p>A typical city gate is a gatehouse with two portcullises and murder holes above the space between them. In towns and some small cities, the primary entry is through iron double doors set into the city wall.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gates are usually open during the day and locked or barred at night. Usually, one gate lets in travelers after sunset and is staffed by guards who will open it for someone who seems honest, presents proper papers, or offers a large enough bribe (depending on the city and the guards).</p>"}

Making combat spells with faster casting times devalues the Quicken Spell feat; even if you design the spell to be similar to a quickened spell, including the +4 level boost, it steals from casters who actually learn that feat, and your spell would become a common combo for high-level casters who can afford extra spells of that level. For example, if you create a 5th-level quickened magic missile spell that acts just like a magic missile spell with the Quicken Spell feat, any 14th-level wizard (who has at least three 5th-level spells available) is going to be tempted to learn this spell just because it allows him to add 5d4+5 extra points of damage to any high-level combat spell he casts, which is a way to get around the spell-damage cap. Furthermore, allowing spellcasters to routinely cast two spells per round means they tend to use up their spells more quickly and push their allies to camp and rest rather than continue exploring.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spells that summon creatures to help in combat should have a casting time of &ldquo;1 round.&rdquo; This is to give a reasonable action cost for a character casting the spell. If the caster could summon a monster using a standard action and have it act that same round, it&rsquo;s like the spell didn&rsquo;t cost him any actions at all.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spells that call an outsider to serve for more than a few rounds (such as planar ally and planar binding) should have a casting time of 10 minutes; more powerful spells may have even longer casting times. Note that gate can be used to call creatures and only has a casting time of 1 standard action, but when used this way, it requires a 10,000 gp material component, so that faster casting time doesn&rsquo;t come cheaply.</p>"}

For example, each square of movement through difficult terrain counts as 2 squares, and each diagonal move through such terrain counts as 3 squares ( just as two diagonal moves normally do).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If movement cost is doubled twice, then each square counts as 4 squares (or as 6 squares if moving diagonally). If movement cost is doubled three times, then each square counts as 8 squares (12 if diagonal) and so on. This is an exception to the general rule that two doublings are equivalent to a tripling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Minimum Movement</h2>\n<p>Despite whatever penalties to movement you might have, you can take a full-round action to move 5 feet (1 square) in any direction, even diagonally. This rule doesn&rsquo;t allow you to move through impassable terrain or to move when all movement is prohibited. Such movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal (despite the distance covered, this move isn&rsquo;t a 5-foot step).</p>"}

Outsider Categories}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 101</em></p>\n<p>There is one method of outsider coercion that helps guarantee that a binder can bargain from a position of relative security. Many spellcasters believe that a true name is inscribed on the essence of every creature, a secret word that describes it so perfectly and utterly that to speak the name is to define the being. For mortals, this name is buried in the soul, hidden away from prying and dangerous eyes. Outsiders&rsquo; true names take the form of sigils carved upon their very essence. In Hell, these sigils change as the devil changes in stature, and some that may once have held power over certain devils have become outdated. It is said that some outsiders have assumed names and that they use the aliases to lure foolish mortals into using for summoning; the outsider pretends to be under the control of the binder, but merely bides its time before it strikes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To discover a single outsider&rsquo;s true name, a spellcaster must spend at least a month in a library or on a quest of discovery to uncover occult mysteries and riddles hidden in the pages of books, scrolls, and glyphs written millennia ago, buried in ancient temples or found among the ravings of madmen&rsquo;s spellbooks. At the end of this month, the GM makes a Knowledge (planes) check for the character. The DC is 10 + the creature&rsquo;s Hit Dice. The GM can increase the DC by +2, +5, or even +10, based on the power of the outsider or the circumstances of the true name search. A failure by 5 or more turns up false information that may expose researchers to unexpected dangers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For most outer-planar outsiders, knowledge of the creature&rsquo;s true name is a powerful weapon. In summoning, if the name is spoken correctly (requiring knowledge of at least one of the outsider&rsquo;s languages, or a Linguistics skill check with a DC equal to 10 + the creature&rsquo;s Hit Dice), the target takes a &ndash;5 penalty on the Will save to resist being conjured, and if its name is inscribed in the protective magic circle, the outsider takes a &ndash;5 penalty on all checks to escape or breach that circle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For elementals (including geniekind), such true names are not binding as they are for fiends and other outsiders, and do not give the creature a penalty to its Will save to resist being summoned. However, if the caster speaks the true name of the elemental, the elemental will most likely be intrigued enough to listen&mdash;a wizard with power and cunning enough to find an elemental&rsquo;s true name is a wizard with guile and strength, and elementals treasure these qualities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not all outsiders have true names. The chaotic and primeval nature of proteans defies the strange logic of true names, as does the writhing chaotic nature of the qlippoth. It is unclear whether aeons have true names. There are those sages who believe each aeon has two true names, and only by finding out both names can a creature gain some control over the aeon, but such matters are purely conjecture.</p>"}

Subraces}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Advanced Player's Guide pg. 72</em></p>\n<p>From the noble paladin to the skillful rogue, each core class in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game draws upon a central archetype. Yet, beyond that basic concept exists the potential for innumerable interpretations, details, and refinements. The fighter class, for example, might easily be sculpted into a dead-eye archer, a fleet-footed duelist, a stealthy jungle hunter, or countless other types of martial masters, all refined by a player&rsquo;s choice of details, class options, and specific rules. Yet some archetypes prove pervasive and exciting enough to see use in play time and time again. To help players interested in creating iconic fantasy characters, the following pages explore new rules, options, and alternate class features for each core class.</p>\n<p>So while most druids wander the woods, some track through the vast desert, reveling in what the wastes have to offer. Such optional features represent a unique view of what a class deliberately designed to capture a specific character archetype might become. While the types of options presented for each core class differ, each subsystem is customized to best serve that class, emulate the abilities and talents of classic fantasy archetypes, and expand players&rsquo; freedom to design exactly the characters they desire.</p>\n<h2>Alternate Class Features</h2>\n<p>Most of the options presented on the following pages include a host of alternate class features. When a character selects a class, he must choose to use the standard class features found in the Core Rulebook or those listed in one of the archetypes presented here. Each alternate class feature replaces a specific class feature from its parent class. For example, the elemental fist class feature of the monk of the four winds replaces the stunning fist class feature of the monk. When an archetype includes multiple class features, a character must take all of them&mdash;often blocking the character from ever gaining certain familiar class features, but replacing them with equally powerful options.</p>\n<p>All of the other class features found in the core class and not mentioned among the alternate class features remain unchanged and are acquired normally when the character reaches the appropriate level (unless noted otherwise). A character who takes an alternate class feature does not count as having the class feature that was replaced when meeting any requirements or prerequisites.<br /><br />A character can take more than one archetype and garner additional alternate class features, but none of the alternate class features can replace or alter the same class feature from the core class as another alternate class feature. For example, a paladin could not be both a hospitaler and an undead scourge since they both modify the smite evil class feature and both replace the aura of justice class feature. A paladin could, however, be both an undead scourge and a warrior of the holy light, since none of their new class features replace the same core class feature.</p>\n<h2>Adapting Existing Characters</h2>\n<p>Players with existing characters should talk with their GM about whether on not these alternate class features are available in her game, and if so, whether they can recreate their characters to adopt them. As alternate class features are designed to be balanced when compared to those in the core class, players who revise their characters shouldn&rsquo;t be gaining any special advantage over other party members.</p>\n<p>As long as the GM is comfortable with retroactively adjusting character specifics, there should be no disruption to future adventures. Typically, the best time for a player to adopt alternate class features and significantly revise his character is when leveling up between adventures, though he should always check with the GM before doing so, as she may wish to work significant changes to a character into the campaign.<br /><br />While the GM might want to make concessions for players who didn&rsquo;t have these alternate class features available to them when creating their characters, PCs should be one of the most constant elements of a campaign. Constantly changing and recreating characters can prove problematic to a campaign. While the GM should be willing to adapt and may allow players who grow bored with their characters to redefine them, alternate class abilities shouldn&rsquo;t feel like exploitable options allowing PCs to build and rebuild their characters in whatever ways seem most advantageous at a given moment.</p>\n<p>Allowing players to remake characters in light of newly adopted rules may be desirable on occasion, but GMs shouldn&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re being unfair or breaking any rule by not allowing players to rebuild characters or by disallowing certain options. While the GM should always strive to help players run the characters they want, ultimately she knows what&rsquo;s best for the campaign.</p>"}

It is the most comfortable and survivable of the Inner Planes and is the home of all manner of airborne creatures. Indeed, flying creatures find themselves at a great advantage on this plane. While travelers without flight can survive easily here, they are at a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>The Plane of Air exists at the edge of the universe&mdash;a &ldquo;skin&rdquo; of wind and clouds where down seems to be in every direction at once. Here, the sky is everything there is, and only those who can fly can ever truly call this reality home.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just beyond the Material Plane floats the immense, seemingly peaceful blue firmament of the Plane of Air. Known to many as the Endless Sky, this plane is shot through with enormous clouds, floating cities of fantastic design, meandering sheets of ice and crystal, strange spheres of brass and iron, and even more astounding features. Towering cloud walls mark the borders it shares with the edge of the Material Plane&rsquo;s universe, and gigantic water bubbles&mdash;oceanic ecosystems in their own right&mdash;pepper the areas abutting the Plane of Water. Although its population is scant in comparison to those of the other Elemental Planes, the Plane of Air is home to a grand djinni society, dozens of mephit kingdoms, and a plentitude of diverse creatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Breathable air is the plane&rsquo;s most dominant substance, making the Plane of Air the most hospitable of all the Elemental Planes for visitors from the Material Plane.</p>\n<p>Flying creatures have great advantages here, though nonnatives of all sorts might find themselves constrained by the lack of solid ground. Such material does exist, in the form of great chunks of drifting ice originating from the adjacent Plane of Water and magically suspended hunks of earth and crystal&mdash;but such places are few and far between.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Denizens</h2>\n<p>Although it is the least populated of the Elemental Planes due to its lack of solid ground, the Plane of Air still teems with life. Unlike on the outer planes, the petitioners of the Plane of Air (vaporous entities known as air pneumas) are not common, as the time it takes for an air pneuma to transition into an air elemental or similar creature is typically quite short. Listed below are several prominent or noteworthy residents whom planar travelers might encounter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Djinn</h3>\n<p>The Plane of Air&rsquo;s native genies are the true lords of the Endless Sky. Powerful beings in their own right, they focus on art, culture, trade, and especially the acquisition of knowledge, which brings them great wealth and even greater influence. Calmer and more peaceful than the genies native to other planes, djinn are nonetheless quick to remind all listeners that they have been the plane&rsquo;s undisputed masters since before the mortal races appeared. This sense of superiority, combined with their paternalism toward nongenies, has earned the djinn a widespread reputation of insufferable self-importance. Despite the djinn&rsquo;s stuffy proclamations, some believe that their superiority has not always been uncontested. Mysterious metal spheres scattered throughout the plane fuel rumors of a long-vanquished foe. A recent theory involves an ancient war between the djinn and a contingent of extraplanar outsiders, or perhaps gods. Some claim that these spheres actually imprison the genies&rsquo; rivals. The djinn&rsquo;s failure to acknowledge these rumors, plus their refusal to build upon or even touch these spheres, has done nothing to quell such speculation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Air Elementals</h3>\n<p>Though just as disorganized as other elementals, air elementals have their own culture and are known for being more gregarious than others of their kind. They are intelligent, but their mind-sets and emotions can change as quickly as the winds from which they are born. The elementals&rsquo; command obedience from all but the most rebellious air elementals. Air elementals are not the realm&rsquo;s only elementals. In the places where the azure sky turns dark with violent storms, lightning elementals dash about like children playing in the sea, unleashing great bolts of electricity. Ice elementals also venture to this plane, despite being native to the Plane of Water.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Cloud Dragons</h3>\n<p>Cloud dragons are natives of the Plane of Air and are known for flitting unhindered through the expanse of the Endless Sky, indulging their fickle whims. They have an innate curiosity and may begin a quest for lore or a lost bauble only to allow a distraction to sidetrack them for years. Cloud dragons&rsquo; whimsical journeys sometimes take them away from their home plane; most cloud dragons on the Material Plane traveled there for a specific but now long-forgotten purpose and, finding the mountain peaks of Material Plane worlds quite hospitable, decided to stay.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Mephits</h3>\n<p>Three types of mephits dwell on the Plane of Air: air, dust, and ice mephits. These miniscule scamps sometimes serve the powerful entities that dwell on the Plane of Air and are often seen flitting about the plane&rsquo;s great cities, delivering messages or running errands. Many mephits, however, choose to remain independent. These mephits create small nations on the plane&rsquo;s scattered islands, and each nation&rsquo;s strictures and social mores depend on the type and personality of its self-proclaimed mephit ruler. Mephit nations often have confusing and contradictory laws and customs, making it easy for visitors to unknowingly break them. Moreover, familiarity with the customs of one nation never provides much help in understanding the rules of another.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Sylphs</h3>\n<p>Although uncommon on their progenitors&rsquo; home plane, highly capable sylphs have left the Material Plane in fair numbers to reside on the Plane of Air. They work often as commanders of airship fleets or as extraplanar diplomats for the djinn&mdash;or, more rarely, the elemental population. Still others are high-priced guides for the plane&rsquo;s most esteemed or influential visitors. Some conspirators posit that such sylphs act as spies for extraplanar forces that wish to eventually challenge the djinn for dominance of the plane, but practically no one&mdash;the air genies included&mdash; gives the theory any credence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Divinities</h2>\n<p>Elemental lords of air</p>"}

Though there are no known dwarven cities in this region, the Garundi dwarves claim the extensive tunnels and caverns they move through are the remains of a once=powerful dwarven kingdom, which was struck down by the gods for some long-forgotten offense. These dwarves travel in caravans of 40 or so family units (though the largest caravans can contain more than 300 families) and engage in sporadic clan-based trade or warfare, but they all respect the neutrality of hidden settlements of dwarves who dwell in underground oases within the mountains. Desert dwarves often have the craftsman, mountaineer, and rock stepper alternate racial traits.

The Mbe&rsquo;ke build cities in the mountains of the Terwa Uplands, while the Taralu live in small clans in the eastern jungle. Although there is little contact between the two groups, they share a reverence for and affinity with dragons&mdash;most especially cloud dragons&mdash; as well as any draconic creature that can be reasoned with, including wyverns. Mwangi dwarves often take the magic resistant or surface survivalist alternate racial traits. Those who form the strongest spiritual bonds to some form of dragon sometimes also have the breath weapon alternate racial trait described below.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Ouat Caste Dwarves</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Heroes from the Fringe pg. 4</em><br />The Ouat caste dwarves are a sect of the Pahmet dwarves of Osirion who pursue self-perfection in the style of Irori. Ouat caste dwarves seek to become closer to divinity by overcoming their mortal limitations. They train themselves and others in the monastic city of Tar Kuata, constantly striving to put aside petty material concerns to focus on spiritual growth. The Ouat&rsquo;s focus on the power of will and self-improvement causes many of them to take the relentless and stubborn alternate racial traits. Those who begin the path to inner awareness very early in their lives also sometimes take the iron within alternate racial trait described below.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Pahmet Dwarves</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Heroes from the Fringe pg. 5</em><br />The Pahmet have been present in Osirion since ancient days and claim to have been sent by the gods to warn the pharaohs of impending crises and disasters. Though most scholars suspect that claim is more legend than history, the ancient pharaohs of Osirion treated the Pahmet with great reverence. In return, the Pahmet guard Erekrus, a necropolis in the mountains of southern Osirion, where the Pahmet interred the bodies of pharaohs deemed particularly worthy. The Pahmet are a rigid and often mistrusting people; it is common for its members who avoid contact with outsiders to have the xenophobic alternate racial trait. Many Pahmet have the lorekeeper, mountaineer, rock stepper, and surface survivalist alternate racial traits. Those who come from long lines of keepers who dedicate themselves to the guarding of tombs also often have the death&rsquo;s end alternate racial trait described below.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Paraheen Dwarves</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Heroes from the Fringe pg. 5</em><br />The Paraheen are a small but important part of the society of Katheer, where they operate numerous forges and weapon shops within the city. Not quite a clan, the Paraheen are a set of related, family-run businesses respected for their great craftsmanship and work ethic. While most Paraheen are not citizens of Qadira, they are treated as a valued subclass of residents, with enough powerful patrons among the upper ranks of Qadiran society to afford them protection that in some cases is greater than citizenship. The Paraheen have operated as an autonomous community for centuries, avoiding local politics and worshiping a combination of traditional dwarven gods and an aspect of Sarenrae who is aligned with the fire of the forge. Nearly all Paraheen have the craftsman alternate racial trait, but in the case of the Paraheen, it replaces hardy rather than greed. Those Paraheen who are involved in trade by river and sea, common in Katheer, also generally have the saltbeard alternate racial trait. Most Paraheen from older families tend to have the iron citizen alternate racial trait described below.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Sky Citadel Dwarves</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Heroes from the Fringe pg. 5</em><br />When the dwarves successfully completed the Quest for Sky, they set about constructing 10 Sky Citadels, massive fortresses that formed the basis for dwarven kingdoms in the Inner Sea region. While several of those Sky Citadels have been lost or overrun, a few&mdash;such as Highhelm, Janderhoff, and Dongun Hold&mdash;remain bastions of dwarven tradition and authority. Because these Sky Citadels often have connections to the Darklands, it is common for the dwarves dwelling in their lower reaches to have the ancient enmity or deep warrior alternate racial traits, while those in lands populated by ogres and hill giants often have the giant hunter alternate racial trait, and those in wealthy areas that attract the attention of dragons sometimes have the sky sentinel or wyrmscourged alternate racial traits. Because of the eon-long histories of the Sky Citadels, their citizens also often have the deep tradition alternate racial trait described below.</p>"}

The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Conscious characters with negative hit point totals are treated as disabled characters (see page 189). If the character remains unconscious, he receives another check every hour to regain consciousness. A natural 20 on this check is an automatic success. Even if unconscious, the character recovers hit points naturally. He automatically regains consciousness when his hit points rise to 1 or higher.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Recovering without Help</h2>\n<p>A severely wounded character left alone usually dies. He has a small chance of recovering on his own. Treat such characters as those attempting to recover with help, but every failed Constitution check to regain consciousness results in the loss of 1 hit point. An unaided character does not recover hit points naturally. Once conscious, the character can make a DC 10 Constitution check once per day, after resting for 8 hours, to begin recovering hit points naturally. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Failing this check causes the character to lose 1 hit point, but this does not cause the character to become unconscious. Once a character makes this check, he continues to heal naturally and is no longer in danger of losing hit points naturally.</p>"}

If the amount of ability damage you have taken equals or exceeds your ability score, you immediately fall unconscious until the damage is less than your ability score. The only exception to this is your Constitution score. If the damage to your Constitution is equal to or greater than your Constitution score, you die.

In addition, multiply your total Hit Dice by this penalty and subtract that amount from your current and total hit points. Lost hit points are restored when the damage to your Constitution is healed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Intelligence</h2>\n<p>Damage to your Intelligence score causes you to take penalties on Intelligence-based skill checks. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on Intelligence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wisdom</h2>\n<p>Damage to your Wisdom score causes you to take penalties on Wisdom-based skill checks and Will saving throws. This penalty also applies to any spell DCs based on Wisdom.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Charisma</h2>\n<p>Damage to your Charisma score causes you to take penalties on Charisma-based skill checks.

Dungeon walls are difficult to break down or through, but they&rsquo;re generally easy to climb.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Masonry Walls</h2>\n<p>The most common kind of dungeon wall, masonry walls are usually at least 1 foot thick. Often, these ancient walls sport cracks and crevices, and sometimes dangerous slimes or small monsters live in these areas and wait for prey. Masonry walls stop all but the loudest noises. It takes a DC 20 Climb check to travel along a masonry wall.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Superior Masonry Walls</h2>\n<p>Sometimes masonry walls are better built (smoother, with tighter-fitting stones and less cracking), and occasionally these superior walls are covered with plaster or stucco. Covered walls often bear paintings, carved reliefs, or other decoration. Superior masonry walls are no more difficult to destroy than regular masonry walls but are more difficult to climb (DC 25).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Reinforced Masonry Walls</h2>\n<p>These are masonry walls with iron bars on one or both sides of the wall, or placed within the wall to strengthen it. The hardness of a reinforced wall remains the same, but its hit points are doubled and the Strength check DC to break through it is increased by 10.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hewn Stone Walls</h2>\n<p>Such walls usually result when a chamber or passage is tunneled out from solid rock. The rough surface of a hewn wall frequently provides minuscule ledges where fungus grows and fissures where vermin, bats, and subterranean snakes live. When such a wall has an &ldquo;other side&rdquo; (meaning it separates two chambers in the dungeon), the wall is usually at least 3 feet thick; anything thinner risks collapsing from the weight of all the stone overhead. It takes a DC 25 Climb check to climb a hewn stone wall.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unworked Stone Walls</p>\n<p>These surfaces are uneven and rarely flat. They are smooth to the touch but filled with tiny holes, hidden alcoves, and ledges at various heights. They&rsquo;re also usually wet or at least damp, since it&rsquo;s water that most frequently creates natural caves. When such a wall has an &ldquo;other side,&rdquo; the wall is usually at least 5 feet thick. It takes a DC 15 Climb check to move along an unworked stone wall.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Iron Walls</h2>\n<p>These walls are placed within dungeons around important places, such as vaults.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Paper Walls</h2>\n<p>Paper walls are placed as screens to block line of sight, but nothing more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wooden Walls</h2>\n<p>Wooden walls often exist as recent additions to older dungeons, used to create animal pens, storage bins, and temporary structures, or just to make a number of smaller rooms out of a larger one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magically Treated Walls</h2>\n<p>These walls are stronger than average, with a greater hardness, more hit points, and a higher break DC. Magic can usually double the hardness and hit points of a wall and add up to 20 to the break DC. A magically treated wall also gains a saving throw against spells that could affect it, with the save bonus equaling 2 + 1/2 the caster level of the magic reinforcing the wall. Creating a magic wall requires the Craft Wondrous Item feat and the expenditure of 1,500 gp for each 10-foot-by-10- foot wall section.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Walls with Arrow Slits</h2>\n<p>Walls with arrow slits can be made of any durable material but are most commonly masonry, hewn stone, or wood. Such a wall allows defenders to fire arrows or crossbow bolts at intruders from behind the safety of the wall. Archers behind arrow slits have improved cover that gives them a +8 bonus to Armor Class, a +4 bonus on Reflex saves, and the benefits of the improved evasion class feature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 13-1: Walls</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 89.7175%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 29.7454%;\" scope=\"col\">Wall Type</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.4899%;\" scope=\"col\">Typical Thickness</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 11.8954%;\" scope=\"col\">Break DC</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.1569%;\" scope=\"col\">Hardness</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.2484%;\" scope=\"col\">Hit Points1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.2876%;\" scope=\"col\">Climb DC</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 29.7454%;\">Masonry</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.4899%;\">1 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 11.8954%;\">35</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.1569%;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.2484%;\">90 hp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.2876%;\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 29.7454%;\">Superior Masonry</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.4899%;\">1 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 11.8954%;\">35</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.1569%;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.2484%;\">90 hp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.2876%;\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 29.7454%;\">Reinforced Masonry</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.4899%;\">1 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 11.8954%;\">45</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.1569%;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.2484%;\">180 hp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.2876%;\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 29.7454%;\">Hewn Stone</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.4899%;\">3 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 11.8954%;\">50</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.1569%;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.2484%;\">540 hp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.2876%;\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 29.7454%;\">Unworked stone</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.4899%;\">5 ft.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 11.8954%;\">65</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.1569%;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.2484%;\">900 hp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.2876%;\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 29.7454%;\">Iron</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.4899%;\">3 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 11.8954%;\">30</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.1569%;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.2484%;\">90 hp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.2876%;\">25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 29.7454%;\">Paper</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.4899%;\">Paper-thin</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 11.8954%;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.1569%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.2484%;\">1 hp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.2876%;\">30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 29.7454%;\">Wood</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.4899%;\">5 in.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 11.8954%;\">20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.1569%;\">5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.2484%;\">60 hp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 29.7454%;\">Magically treated2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 18.4899%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 11.8954%;\">+20</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.1569%;\">&times;2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.2484%;\">&times;23</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 12.2876%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&lt;td21&lt; td=\"\"&gt;&lt;/td21&lt;&gt;1 Per 10-foot-by-10-foot section.<br />2 This modifier can be applied to any of the other wall types.<br />3 Or an additional 50 hit points, whichever is greater.</p>"}

Duel Results}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 150</em></p>\n<p>A duel functions much like ordinary combat, with a few notable exceptions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the start of the duel, each participant makes an initiative check, just like in standard combat. Because duels are always planned and expected, there is never a surprise round. Alternatively, some duels start off with each side facing off, waiting for the other to flinch or break resolve. In such cases, substitute a Bluff, Intimidate, or Sense Motive check in place of the standard initiative check. The skill used is decided by the individual participants and is reflective of their approach to the duel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the beginning of each round, the participants check the status of the duel (the GM may want to mark the beginning of each round in some way during initiative tracking as a reminder to check this status). So long as all participants agree to continue dueling, the duel goes on. If any one of the participants withdraws from the duel, the duel immediately ends for all participants, even those who would see it continue. The participant or side that ended the duel is considered the loser of the duel. The duel&rsquo;s remaining participants can, among themselves, agree to resume the duel, but this is considered a separate duel from the previous one and does not involve those who withdrew from the duel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each participant in a duel can act normally on his turn, but his actions must target or affect either himself or one of the other duel participants (either an ally or an opponent). For example, a warrior might make an attack with his bow against anyone participating in the duel, or he might administer a potion to a wounded ally also involved in the duel, but he could not attack anyone other than a participant. Similarly a dueling wizard could not cast haste on allies outside the duel while excluding himself, but he could cast it on his allies if he was among the targets. The same goes for offensive spells, such as fireball&mdash;the dueling caster must include one of his opponents in the duel among the targets of the spell, and could not affect some nearby creatures to the exclusion of his opponent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to his normal actions, each participant in a duel may use one of a number of special immediate actions, available only to characters participating in a duel. They may take dueling counters, dueling dodges, dueling parries, or dueling resolve actions, each of which is described below.</p>"}

Changing Alignment}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source<em> </em></strong><em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 166</em></p>\n<p>Nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations of the lawful-chaotic axis with the good-evil axis. Each description below depicts a typical character of that alignment. Remember that individuals vary from this norm, and that a given character may act more or less in accord with his alignment from day to day. Use these descriptions as guidelines, not as scripts.</p>\n<p>The first six alignments, lawful good through chaotic neutral, are standard alignments for player characters. The three evil alignments are usually for monsters and villains. With the GM&rsquo;s permission, a player may assign an evil alignment to his PC, but such characters are often a source of disruption and conf lict with good and neutral party members. GMs are encouraged to carefully consider how evil PCs might affect the campaign before allowing them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lawful Good</h2>\n<p>A lawful good character acts as a good person is expected or required to act. She combines a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly. She tells the truth, keeps her word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished.</p>\n<p>Lawful good combines honor with compassion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Neutral Good</h2>\n<p>A neutral good character does the best that a good person can do. He is devoted to helping others. He works with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them.</p>\n<p>Neutral good means doing what is good and right without bias for or against order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Chaotic Good</h2>\n<p>A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he&rsquo;s kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society.</p>\n<p>Chaotic good combines a good heart with a free spirit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lawful Neutral</h2>\n<p>A lawful neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs her. Order and organization are paramount. She may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or she may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government.</p>\n<p>Lawful neutral means you are reliable and honorable without being a zealot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Neutral</h2>\n<p>A neutral character does what seems to be a good idea. She doesn&rsquo;t feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos (and thus neutral is sometimes called &ldquo;true neutral&rdquo;). Most neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than a commitment to neutrality. Such a character probably thinks of good as better than evil&mdash;after all, she would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones. Still, she&rsquo;s not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.</p>\n<p>Some neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality. They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes. They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run.</p>\n<p>Neutral means you act naturally in any situation, without prejudice or compulsion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Chaotic Neutral</h2>\n<p>Achaotic neutral character follows his whims. He is an individualist first and last. He values his own liberty but doesn&rsquo;t strive to protect others&rsquo; freedom. He avoids authority, resents restrictions, and challenges traditions. A chaotic neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy. To do so, he would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those others suffer). A chaotic neutral character may be unpredictable, but his behavior is not totally random. He is not as likely to jump off a bridge as he is to cross it.</p>\n<p>Chaotic neutral represents freedom from both society&rsquo;s restrictions and a do-gooder&rsquo;s zeal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lawful Evil</h2>\n<p>A lawful evil villain methodically takes what he wants within the limits of his code of conduct without regard for whom it hurts. He cares about tradition,loyalty, and order, but not about freedom, dignity, or life. He plays by the rules but without mercy or compassion. He is comfortable in a hierarchy and would like to rule, but is willing to serve. He condemns others not according to their actions but according to race, religion, homeland, or social rank. He is loath to break laws or promises. This reluctance comes partly from his nature and partly because he depends on order to protect himself from those who oppose him on moral grounds. Some lawful evil villains have particular taboos, such as not killing in cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not letting children come to harm (if it can be helped). They imagine that these compunctions put them above unprincipled villains.</p>\n<p>Some lawful evil people and creatures commit themselves to evil with a zeal like that of a crusader committed to good. Beyond being willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in spreading evil as an end unto itself. They may also see doing evil as part of a duty to an evil deity or master.</p>\n<p>Lawful evil represents methodical, intentional, and organized evil.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Neutral Evil</h2>\n<p>A neutral evil villain does whatever she can get away with. She is out for herself, pure and simple. She sheds no tears for those she kills, whether for profit, sport, or convenience. She has no love of order and holds no illusions that following laws, traditions, or codes would make her any better or more noble. On the other hand, she doesn&rsquo;t have the restless nature or love of conf lict that a chaotic evil villain has.</p>\n<p>Some neutral evil villains hold up evil as an ideal, committing evil for its own sake. Most often, such villains are devoted to evil deities or secret societies. Neutral evil represents pure evil without honor and without variation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Chaotic Evil</h2>\n<p>A chaotic evil character does what his greed, hatred, and lust for destruction drive him to do. He is vicious, arbitrarily violent, and unpredictable. If he is simply out for whatever he can get, he is ruthless and brutal. If he is committed to the spread of evil and chaos, he is even worse. Thankfully, his plans are haphazard, and any groups he joins or forms are likely to be poorly organized. Typically, chaotic evil people can be made to work together only by force, and their leader lasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate him.</p>\n<p>Chaotic evil represents the destruction not only of beauty and life, but also of the order on which beauty and life depend.</p>"}

These magic afflictions can have a wide variety of effects, from a simple penalty to certain checks to transforming the victim into a toad. Some even cause the afflicted to slowly rot away, leaving nothing behind but dust. Unlike other afflictions, most curses cannot be cured through a number of successful saving throws. Curses can be cured through magic, however, usually via spells such as remove curse and break enchantment. While some curses cause a progressive deterioration, others inflict a static penalty from the moment they are contracted, neither fading over time nor growing worse. In addition, there are a number of magic items that act like curses.</p>\n<p>See @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.LaZ4cSkdCxMwDnXD]{6.1.18. Cursed Items} for a description of these cursed items.</p>"}

Descriptive Text}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 216</em></p>\n<p>Usually a harmful spell allows a target to make a saving throw to avoid some or all of the effect. The saving throw entry in a spell description defines which type of saving throw the spell allows and describes how saving throws against the spell work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Negates</h2>\n<p>The spell has no effect on a subject that makes a successful saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Partial</h2>\n<p>The spell has an effect on its subject. A successful saving throw means that some lesser effect occurs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Half</h2>\n<p>The spell deals damage, and a successful saving throw halves the damage taken (round down).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>None</h2>\n<p>No saving throw is allowed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Disbelief</h2>\n<p>A successful save lets the subject ignore the spell's effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>(Object)</h2>\n<p>The spell can be cast on objects, which receive saving throws only if they are magical or if they are attended (held, worn, grasped, or the like) by a creature resisting the spell, in which case the object uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own bonus is greater. This notation does not mean that a spell can be cast only on objects. Some spells of this sort can be cast on creatures or objects. A magic item's saving throw bonuses are each equal to 2 + 1/2 the item's caster level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>(Harmless)</h2>\n<p>The spell is usually beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a saving throw if it desires.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Saving Throw Difficulty Class</h2>\n<p>A saving throw against your spell has a DC of 10 + the level of the spell + your bonus for the relevant ability (Intelligence for a wizard, Charisma for a bard, paladin, or sorcerer, or Wisdom for a cleric, druid, or ranger). A spell's level can vary depending on your class. Always use the spell level applicable to your class.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Succeeding on a Saving Throw</h2>\n<p>A creature that successfully saves against a spell that has no obvious physical effects feels a hostile force or a tingle, but cannot deduce the exact nature of the attack. Likewise, if a creature's saving throw succeeds against a targeted spell, you sense that the spell has failed. You do not sense when creatures succeed on saves against effect and area spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Automatic Failures and Successes</h2>\n<p>A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always a failure, and the spell may cause damage to exposed items (see Items Surviving after a Saving Throw, below). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is always a success.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Voluntarily Giving up a Saving Throw</h2>\n<p>A creature can voluntarily forego a saving throw and willingly accept a spell's result. Even a character with a special resistance to magic can suppress this quality.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Items Surviving after a Saving Throw</h2>\n<p>Unless the descriptive text for the spell specifies otherwise, all items carried or worn by a creature are assumed to survive a magical attack. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw against the effect, however, an exposed item is harmed (if the attack can harm objects). Refer to Table 9&ndash;2: Items Affected by Magical Attacks. Determine which four objects carried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected and roll randomly among them. The randomly determined item must make a saving throw against the attack form and take whatever damage the attack dealt. If the selected item is not carried or worn and is not magical, it does not get a saving throw. It simply is dealt the appropriate damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 9-2: Items Affected by Magical Attacks</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 57.5138%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.184%;\" scope=\"col\">Order*</td>\n<td style=\"width: 81.0828%;\" scope=\"col\">Item</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.184%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 81.0828%;\">Shield</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.184%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 81.0828%;\">Armor</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.184%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 81.0828%;\">Magic helmet, hat, or headband</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.184%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 81.0828%;\">Item in hand (including weapon, wand, or the like)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.184%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 81.0828%;\">Magic cloak</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.184%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 81.0828%;\">Stowed or sheathed weapon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.184%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 81.0828%;\">Magic bracers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.184%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 81.0828%;\">Magic clothing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.184%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 81.0828%;\">Magic jewelry (including rings)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.184%;\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 81.0828%;\">Anything else</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

Other Outsiders}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 108</em></p>\n<p>True elementals are simple creatures, thriving spirits animating bodies of pure elemental matter. They regard their lives as an eternal struggle to best themselves and each other. Each elemental type is uniquely suited to adapting to conditions on its particular plane, and is arrogant about its powers when surrounded by its element... and uniquely frightened and cowed when shown a greater power or encased in an element not its own. Most elementals do not bargain for favors&mdash;they respect only strength. Genies are the more human-like denizens of the elemental planes, both in shape and mentality. They consider themselves physically and culturally superior to true elementals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In general, one summons an elemental for brute work and combat, and a genie for magical power or ancient wisdom, and would thus use summon monster and planar binding for those tasks, respectively. However, should a conjurer wish to bind an elemental as he would a genie or fiend, the ritual is one of wrestling with the elemental&rsquo;s creativity in reaching its home element. Elementals are immune to bleed, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning. They are not subject to critical hits, precision-based attacks like sneak attack, or flanking.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Genies seek and value power, though they are more brash and boastful than most. It is said the best way to secure the attentions of a genie is to speak its true name, and to offer it aid in battles against its political enemies&mdash;a wise conjurer researches the inner battles of geniekind before summoning a genie, or else is prepared to cow the genie with strong magic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Air Elemental</h2>\n<p>When summoning an air elemental, inscribe the magic circle with diamond powder, and release the elemental only once it has acquiesced to the caster&rsquo;s power. This costs an additional 2,000 gp but adds +4 to the Charisma check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Belker</h2>\n<p>These dull-witted creatures enjoy expensive incense and exotic green woods that create heavy smoke.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crysmal</h2>\n<p>Unlike other elementals, crysmals do bargain, but agree to a binder&rsquo;s demands only if offered a substantial amount of crystal, which they use for reproduction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Djinni</h2>\n<p>Tomes of knowledge or powerful wondrous items tempt djinn and grant the caster a +2 bonus on the Charisma check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Earth Elemental</h2>\n<p>Prepare the summoning chamber with swirling wind- and air-based spells to prevent the elemental from touching the floor. Maintaining this state for 5 rounds demonstrates the binder&rsquo;s superiority over the elemental, and grants a +4 bonus on the Charisma check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Efreeti</h2>\n<p>These warlike creatures value weapons with enhancement bonuses of at least +2 and scrolls of 4th-level or higher spells; these provide a +2 bonus on the binder&rsquo;s Charisma check. Efreet also appreciate attractive humanoid slaves, which give a +1 bonus on the binder&rsquo;s Charisma check for every 10 slaves offered.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fire Elementals</h2>\n<p>When summoning a fire elemental, enclose the casting chamber with stone, remove flammable materials from the room, and prepare a magic circle and spells to protect against fire. Keeping large blocks of ice in the room saps the elemental&rsquo;s power and cows it into submission more quickly, giving the caster a +4 bonus on the Charisma check to trap the elemental.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ice Elemental</h2>\n<p>Binders use actual fire, fire spells, protections against cold, and sometimes even fire creatures to keep ice elementals at bay during summoning. An ice elemental often yields to its binder as soon as serious melting occurs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Invisible Stalker</h2>\n<p>The tactics used to bind invisible stalkers are similar to those used for binding air elementals. Unlike many elementals, invisible stalkers bargain for their services, which is why they are often summoned by mortal spellcasters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Janni</h2>\n<p>The weakest of the genies, the jann are also proud and prone to insult. Gifts of rich fabrics, gems, or jewelry worth 1,000 gp or more soften their outlook and give the conjurer a +2 bonus on her Charisma check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lightning Elemental</h2>\n<p>Lightning elementals are similar to air elementals in that the same bindings work on them, though binders would do well to reinforce such bindings and themselves with protections against electrical damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Marid</h2>\n<p>Capricious and unpredictable, marids love performance and art&mdash;providing them artwork worth 1,000 gp or playing a DC 30 Perform (any) piece (whether performed by the binder or his ally) piques their interest long enough for the conjurer to gain a +2 Charisma bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magma Elemental</h2>\n<p>Magma elementals are composite elemental creatures, taking some aspects from earth elementals and fire elementals. Unsurprisingly, a mix of binding strategies from those two types of elementals often keeps these savage things at bay.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mihstu (SR 19)</h2>\n<p>The strategy for binding and commanding these creatures is similar to that for an air elemental. Unlike other elementals, mihstu typically bargain with the binder, as many wish to haunt the dark places of the Material Plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mud Elemental</h2>\n<p>While mud elementals vary in consistency, all of them fear becoming too watery or too dry, as both conditions have adverse effects on them. Using air spells and petrification spells as punishments for noncompliance usually makes these elementals more willing to take direction and enter into negotiations for appropriate gifts for services rendered.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sandman</h2>\n<p>Subtle and craftier than other elementals, these creatures nearly always bargain with their binder, but are arrogant and headstrong. Even after their task is done, they voluntarily remain on the Material Plane to wreak as much havoc as possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shaitan</h2>\n<p>As the most dense and brash of the genies, shaitans like games of chance and physical skill best of all. Should the caster offer services in exchange for a throw of the dice or a wrestling match&mdash;and go through with the offer&mdash;he&rsquo;ll receive a +2 bonus on his Charisma check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Thoqqua</h2>\n<p>Natives of the harsh landscape where the Planes of Fire and Earth collide, thoqquas are dangerous creatures to summon and bind, and typically rage against their confines, even when properly bound. Those wishing to bind a thoqqua frequently use mephit intermediaries, as those creatures seem to understand thoqquas enough to calm them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Water Elemental</h2>\n<p>When summoning a water elemental, remove sources of water from the room and prepare a bonfire. A ring of fire around the magic circle exposes the elemental to its hated enemy the instant it appears on the Material Plane, distracting it long enough for the binder to seize control. This is an opposed Will check, granting a +1 bonus to the caster for each large fire in the room; success grants a +4 bonus on the Charisma check.</p>"}

A creature standing in the same square as a tree gains partial cover, which grants a +2 bonus to Armor Class and a +1 bonus on Reflex saves. The presence of a tree doesn&rsquo;t otherwise affect a creature&rsquo;s fighting space, because it&rsquo;s assumed that the creature is using the tree to its advantage when it can. The trunk of a typical tree has AC 4, hardness 5, and 150 hp. A DC 15 Climb check is sufficient to climb a tree. Medium and dense forests have massive trees as well. These trees take up an entire square and provide cover to anyone behind them. They have AC 3, hardness 5, and 600 hp. Like their smaller counterparts, it takes a DC 15 Climb check to climb them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Undergrowth</h2>\n<p>Vines, roots, and short bushes cover much of the ground in a forest. A space covered with light undergrowth costs 2 squares of movement to move into, and provides concealment. Undergrowth increases the DC of Acrobatics and Stealth checks by 2 because the leaves and branches get in the way. Heavy undergrowth costs 4 squares of movement to move into and provides concealment with a 30% miss chance (instead of the usual 20%). It increases the DC of Acrobatics checks by 5. Heavy undergrowth is easy to hide in, granting a +5 circumstance bonus on Stealth checks. Running and charging are impossible. Squares with undergrowth are often clustered together. Undergrowth and trees aren&rsquo;t mutually exclusive; it&rsquo;s common for a 5-foot square to have both a tree and undergrowth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Forest Canopy</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s common for elves and other forest dwellers to live on raised platforms far above the surface floor. These wooden platforms often have rope bridges between them. To get to the treehouses, characters ascend the trees&rsquo; branches (Climb DC 15), use rope ladders (Climb DC 0), or take pulley elevators (which can be made to rise a number of feet equal to a Strength check, made each round as a full-round action). Creatures on platforms or branches in a forest canopy are considered to have cover when fighting creatures on the ground, and in medium or dense forests they have concealment as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Other Forest Terrain Elements</h2>\n<p>Fallen logs generally stand about 3 feet high and provide cover just as low walls do. They cost 5 feet of movement to cross. Forest streams average 5 to 10 feet wide and no more than 5 feet deep. Pathways wind through most forests, allowing normal movement and providing neither cover nor concealment. These paths are less common in dense forests, but even unexplored forests have occasional game trails.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stealth and Detection in a Forest</h2>\n<p>In a sparse forest, the maximum distance at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 3d6 &times; 10 feet. In a medium forest, this distance is 2d8 &times; 10 feet, and in a dense forest it is 2d6 &times; 10 feet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because any square with undergrowth provides concealment, it&rsquo;s usually easy for a creature to use the Stealth skill in the forest. Logs and massive trees provide cover, which also makes hiding possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The background noise in the forest makes Perception checks that rely on sound more difficult, increasing the DC of the check by 2 per 10 feet, not 1.</p>"}

Designing Spells}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 135</em></p>\n<p>When it comes to attack spells, there is a clear hierarchy of what kinds of effects are better than others. Here are the attack effects in order of best effect to worst, assuming all other factors (specific immunities, number of targets affected, and so on) are equal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Control</h2>\n<p>A control spell puts an opponent under your control, turning him into an ally or at least keeping him from being an active enemy for a while. This is the best kind of attack spell because not only does it negate an opponent (the same effect as a kill or incapacitate spell), but it also creates a new ally that the caster can turn against his other opponents. Many of the more powerful enchantment spells are control spells, though their drawback is that they tend to be all-or-nothing (if the creature saves, it&rsquo;s completely unaffected by the spell). Examples of control spells are charm monster, charm person, confusion, dominate monster, and dominate person.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Kill</h2>\n<p>A kill spell kills or destroys an opponent outright, bypassing the target&rsquo;s depletable statistics, typically with a Fortitude saving throw. Kill spells are better than incapacitate spells because they don&rsquo;t wear off and there&rsquo;s no chance another enemy can easily reverse the spell (such as with dispel magic). The best of the kill spells still act as damage spells if the target saves, so the caster is guaranteed some effect. Examples of kill spells are disintegrate, finger of death, phantasmal killer, power word kill, slay living, and wail of the banshee.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Incapacitate</h2>\n<p>An incapacitate spell makes the target unable to act against the caster, effectively removing him from a battle for a period of time (possibly permanently) but at the risk of other opponents reversing the incapacitated target&rsquo;s condition. Spells that cause an enemy to flee count as incapacitate spells. Incapacitate spells are better than damage spells because they allow the caster to bypass a target&rsquo;s depletable statistics, sometimes disabling an opponent with a single spell. Examples of incapacitate spells are fear, flesh to stone, hold monster, hold person, power word stun, and sleep.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Damage</h2>\n<p>A damage spell reduces the target&rsquo;s depletable statistics, bringing the target closer to the point where that damage incapacitates it. Damage spells are reliable spells because all creatures have depletable statistics of some sort and because most nonmagical attacks affect depletable statistics (which means that the caster&rsquo;s fighter and rogue allies are helping overcome the opponent). Damage spells are better than penalize spells because damage always stacks (penalties do not) and if the caster and his allies deal enough damage, they&rsquo;ll eventually disable an opponent, whereas it&rsquo;s possible to add penalties almost indefinitely and still have a somewhat viable opponent. Examples of damage spells are cone of cold, fireball, lightning bolt, magic missile, poison, and sound burst.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Penalize</h2>\n<p>A penalize spell gives the target some penalty not related to its depletable statistics, such as an attack penalty, an Armor Class penalty, restrictions on the kinds of actions it can take, and so on. Penalize spells are the weakest sort of spells because in most cases the caster can&rsquo;t kill an opponent with penalties and the penalties don&rsquo;t stack with themselves, so the caster and his allies have to deal with the penalized opponent in some other way (typically through damage spells and nonmagical attacks). Examples of penalize spells are bane, blindness/deafness, ray of enfeeblement, and slow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are exceptions to the above categories. For example, if dealing with a monster that has a lot of hit points and deals substantial damage but only has a moderate chance of harming the caster&rsquo;s allies, the caster may be better off trying to give the opponent an attack penalty (to decrease the chance of the monster hitting) than trying to wear down its hit points (because during that time the monster may be dealing a lot of damage to the caster&rsquo;s allies). In this case, a penalize spell that reduces its attack bonus is better than a damage spell. As another example, the PCs may need to question a defeated opponent, in which case an incapacitate spell is a better choice than a kill spell (unless the PCs have some really good magic that lets them question the dead more effectively than speak with dead).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spells with variable effects may be more than one type of spell in the hierarchy depending on the results&mdash;a confusion spell that causes a monster to babble incoherently is an incapacitate spell, but if the spell causes it to attack one of its allies, it&rsquo;s a control spell. Likewise, a summon monster spell that summons a fiendish constrictor snake is an incapacitate spell if the snake grapples an enemy, but it&rsquo;s just a damage spell if it summons a fiendish boar, which only deals damage and has no special attacks. Balancing these spells is tricky, as you have to consider their optimal usage.</p>"}

However, every bit of this plane glows brightly with innate power. This power is dangerous to mortal forms, which are not made to handle it. Despite the beneficial effects of the plane, it is one of the most hostile of the Inner Planes. An unprotected character on this plane swells with power as positive energy is forced upon her. Then, because her mortal frame is unable to contain that power, she is immolated, like a mote of dust caught at the edge of a supernova. Visits to the Positive Energy Plane are brief, and even then travelers must be heavily protected.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Planar Traits</h2>\n<p>The Positive Energy Plane has the following traits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Subjective Directional Gravity</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Major Positive-Dominant:</strong>&nbsp;Some regions of the plane have the minor positive-dominant trait instead, and those islands tend to be inhabited.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy are enhanced. Class abilities that use positive energy, such as channel positive energy, gain a +4 bonus to the save DC to resist the ability.</li>\n<li><strong>Impeded Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy (including inflict spells) are impeded.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Occult Adventures pg. 239</em></p>\n<p>The Positive Energy Plane is the source of all life, the Cosmic Fire at the heart of the multiverse that gives birth to mortal souls. The plane has no surface and exists as an emanation of life-giving energy radiating from an incandescent interior that resembles the molten heart of an active star. Ironically for a plane associated with life, the Positive Energy Plane can be extremely deadly to mortal visitors, as its ambient energies are so powerful that a mortal shell cannot absorb them without bursting. At certain vertices, the refraction of the Cosmic Fire&rsquo;s rays create islands of solidity where the plane&rsquo;s energies are not so extreme, and some manner of life as mortals understand it becomes possible. Here, upon vast shimmering fields, phoenix-feathered creatures known as the jyoti tend to orchards of glowing, anemone-like trees as tall as mountains, sprouting immature souls like glossy, liquid fruit. The xenophobic jyoti dwell in complex cities of crystal specially designed to reflect the weird luminescence of the Cosmic Fire. Jyoti seldom venture from these structures, focusing all of their energies on their sacred charge of tending and defending the nascent souls of the multiverse. At the center of each jyoti city is an imposing gate to a star in the cosmos of the Material Plane. New souls pass through these gates and ride waves of light to find incarnation in mortal vessels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the jyoti dedicate themselves to the protection of incubating immature souls, the other primary inhabitants of the Positive Energy Plane, the manasaputras, dedicate their existence to assisting the spiritual development of mortals. These &ldquo;sons of mind&rdquo; are the powerful psychic incarnations of mortals who have endured scores of mortal reincarnations, with each step becoming more attuned to the universal undersoul. The greatest and most powerful of the manasaputras&mdash;the glory-clad solar kumaras&mdash; dwell within the heart of the Cosmic Fire, and claim to be in communication with it. Lesser manasaputras like agnishvattas, barhisads, and manus spread through the Inner Sphere to initiate mortal adepts in the occult nature of the multiverse, so that they too might step once again into the light that birthed them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For reasons unknown even to the eldest natives, divine beings cannot enter the Positive Energy Plane. Refugees from the vengeance of the gods or those hoping to hide important relics from certain divinities sometimes venture to the Positive Energy Plane to negotiate with the jyoti, who over the centuries have amassed an astounding trove of world-shattering artifacts, illegitimate half-mortal bastards, heretics, and other dangers.</p>\n<p>The Positive Energy Plane is a luminous, burning void and the origin of pre-incarnate souls&mdash;the source of all life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Positive Energy Plane is the source of pre-incarnate mortal souls and the wellspring of life&rsquo;s animating force, but despite this, it may well be the single most hostile plane of existence. Blinding, brilliant, and burning, Creation&rsquo;s Forge resembles the heart of a blazing star. There is precious little solid ground except for outcroppings of iridescent crystal composed of solid positive energy, and despite the popular but incorrect association of positive energy with goodness, the force of unrestrained life is relentlessly destructive to mortal flesh.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The bright twin of the Negative Energy Plane&rsquo;s entropic force, the Positive Energy Plane receives raw quintessence devoured by Limbo, forming one pole of the cosmic cycle of souls. It is here that souls originate and begin their journey, in this place paradoxically inimical to most life, often comparatively barren and sterile, but nevertheless having an overwhelming alien beauty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Divinities</h2>\n<p>Among the planes, the Positive Energy Plane is unusual not merely due to the lack of deities who make their domain there but because deities are entirely barred from entry and taking direct action in the realm. Whether this is a self-imposed limitation or something of a fundamental truth of reality is unclear. Among demigods, only kumaras&mdash;incredibly powerful manasaputras&mdash;maintain realms here, and they are quick to explain, when asked, that they are visitors to Creation&rsquo;s Forge; that such visits might last for thousands upon thousands of years is somewhat irrelevant to an ageless entity. Other demigods avoid the plane entirely. Servants of the divine face no such restriction, of course.</p>\n<p>The deep antipathy and suspicion jyoti harbor toward the divine certainly suggests that their race&rsquo;s existence has some unknown link to whatever bars deities from entering the Positive Energy Plane. Some scholars have inferred their own reasons, suggesting that the presence of shackled danavas within the plane speaks to an early attempt by a deity (or maybe even an entire pantheon) to interfere with or regulate the flow of pre-incarnate mortal souls, a concept jyoti find abhorrent. Additional sources (primarily those associated with the Horsemen of the Apocalypse&mdash;although curiously enough, not in the infamous pages of the Book of the Damned) refer to the Positive Energy Plane as &ldquo;the feast that eludes,&rdquo; suggesting early attempts by the Horsemen to investigate the source of mortal souls and potentially short-circuit the system in order to accomplish their goal of ending all mortal life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Denizens</h2>\n<p>The greatest danger of the Positive Energy Plane is the nature of the plane itself, but those who manage to protect themselves from being overwhelmed by raw life force and the blinding vistas can find much to wonder and marvel at within Creation&rsquo;s Forge. There are no astronomical bodies to speak of in the &ldquo;skies&rdquo; of this plane, nor is there a workable analog to north.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That fewer beings dwell upon the Positive Energy Plane than the Negative Energy Plane is one of the oldest ironies of the Great Beyond. At least on the Negative Energy Plane, undead can dwell and prosper&mdash;but on the Positive Energy Plane, the opposite does not hold true. Living creatures are bolstered and energized by brief exposure to the Positive Energy Plane, but those who stay too long are quickly overloaded by raw life force and perish as their souls are absorbed and recycled. Despite this inhospitable feature, a few forms of life have managed to adapt and even flourish in this overwhelming plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Danavas</h3>\n<p>The first danavas came to the Positive Energy Plane near the dawn of creation itself, but though they are among reality&rsquo;s oldest denizens, today they are met with abhorrence and hatred by other natives of the plane. Jyoti view them as a grotesque meddling by the gods in a task that was removed from deific purview and instead granted to jyoti by the nameless presence of their own convoluted religion, which remains opaque to those outside their race. The presence of those few danavas in Creation&rsquo;s Forge, and in the Void as well, may in fact be what sparked jyoti&rsquo;s antipathy towards the divine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Jyoti</h3>\n<p>Often erroneously called phoenix-kin, jyoti are the most populous natives of the Positive Energy Plane. They appear as radiant humanoid birds with glowing auras, but unlike phoenixes, which are benevolent magical beasts, jyoti are cold, secretive, exceptionally xenophobic, and have a severe antipathy and distrust of the divine. Dwelling in towering cities grown of luminous, living crystal, jyoti are guardians and stewards of their plane, and they see themselves as protectors and even cultivators of the Furnace&rsquo;s preincarnate souls. Who or what appointed them is unknown&mdash; the &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; may indeed simply be a perpetuation of their own perceptions of their kind&rsquo;s importance in the Great Beyond. Jyoti are not born, nor do they age. They form spontaneously from their plane&rsquo;s raw and burning essence, and their subsequent activities help to keep the cosmic cycle of souls flowing. More than anything, jyoti abhor negative energy and those who use it, whether directly or indirectly (as in the case of undead). Yet rather than being an antipathy borne of rival energies, jyoti&rsquo;s relationship to sceaduinars on the Negative Energy Plane is strangely complicated; scholars suspect a deep and opaque history exists between the races. Jyoti view sceaduinars not as enemies, but as objects of profound pity, and they embrace the act of destroying them as a mercy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Manasaputras</h3>\n<p>Manasaputras manifest when the reincarnated soul of a mortal who sought perfection and spiritual transcendence in life merges with the raw energy of life itself. Shedding the bonds of mortality, these souls continue on in their new forms, seeking to guide other mortals through the same difficult trek towards enlightenment. Manasaputras share a mutual respect with jyoti, who temper their instinctive xenophobia when they meet (though neither do jyoti actively seek out manasaputras to interact with). Manasaputras welcome visitors, and their acceptance and hospitality typically is accompanied by lessons geared toward the visitor&rsquo;s spiritual maturation and enlightenment. The greatest manasaputras seek out the wisdom of a mysterious presence they call the Logos&mdash;a presence some equate with the same ill-defined object of the aeons&rsquo; worship and perhaps also that which the jyoti claim tasked them with guardianship of souls. of the three, only the manasaputras ever discuss the subject with others, but their teachings come in the form of personal quests geared toward guiding scholars to come to their own conclusions, rather than simply imparting answers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Turuls</h3>\n<p>The relationship these gargantuan and powerful avian outsiders have with jyoti is a curious one indeed&mdash;a relationship that certainly goes beyond mere physical similarity. Some believe the two races to be different incarnations of the same genesis, with others going a step further to suggest turuls represent a higher form of reincarnation than jyoti. Neither turuls nor jyoti speak of the matter. Often, a turul can be found dwelling among jyoti, living alongside them atop great spires of crystal and acting as protectors and advisors even though jyoti tend to ignore their presence. More often, however, turuls prefer isolation. They often watch over places where the boundaries between the Material Plane and the Positive Energy Plane wear thin, roosting amid great crystalline trees or vast mountains of force. While moody and haughty, turuls often select mortal communities and pose as divine figures or beings of prophecy, working to manipulate and shepherd Material Plane societies toward mysterious goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic on the Positive Energy Plane</h2>\n<p>Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy (including cure spells) are enhanced. Class abilities that use positive energy, such as channel energy, gain a +4 bonus to the save DC to resist the ability.</p>\n<p>Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are impeded.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Darkness and Light</h2>\n<p>The process by which pre-incarnate souls migrate from the Positive Energy Plane into the Material Plane is not well understood; likewise, the point at which a soul infuses a life is unknown and subject to great debate across all worlds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One particularly compelling theory holds that at the heart of every star in the universe lies a pinpoint portal to the Positive Energy Plane. Whether these portals are what ignites new stars, or whether they form as a side effect of the cosmic violence of a new star&rsquo;s explosive birth is unclear, and the evidence gives little weight to one side over the other. If stars are the points of access for new souls into the Material Plane, however, this may explain why the Material Plane is the only plane in the entire Great Beyond that is not inhabited primarily by outsiders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some scholars have taken this theory a step further and have proposed that black holes are similar pinpoint portals, connecting instead to the Negative Energy Plane. How the proximity of a black hole to a world might affect the paths taken by souls into the River of Souls is unknown, since such regions of space typically leave nothing behind to learn from&mdash;black holes consume everything, after all!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pre-Incarnate Souls</h2>\n<p>Pre-incarnate souls have no sentience and are more akin to a form of energy than to distinct creatures, as it is the process of life itself that shapes a pre-incarnate soul into an actual soul. At most, a pre-incarnate souls act like natural forces with a minor tendency to mirror the actions of living creatures, moving and flowing with a semblance of life and organization, though this is little more than an illusion.</p>\n<p>New pre-incarnate souls are constantly manifesting, and are almost impossible to destroy. Powerful blasts of negative energy could wipe out a pre-incarnate soul, as could magic like wish or miracle, but not effects that directly target and damage souls, since a pre-incarnate soul lacks the qualities that allow, for example, an astradaemon&rsquo;s devour soul ability or trap the soul to function. Despite these facts, jyoti are ferociously protective of pre-incarnate souls and act like shepherds where they gather, nurturing and singing to them as they slowly mature during their migration toward life on the Material Plane.</p>\n<p>A pre-incarnate soul is a quivering, floating mass of quintessence, spiritual potential, and positive energy, and contact with one can have unusual results. A character who comes into contact with a pre-incarnate soul increases the effects of positive-dominant essence traits currently affecting the character by one step (or doubles the effects of major positive-dominant effects) for as long as the contact persists (minimum of 1 round). In addition, each round of contact with a pre-incarnate soul removes 1 negative level from a creature per round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

It is one of the more hospitable of the Inner Planes once a traveler gets past the problem of breathing the local medium.</p>\n<p>The eternal oceans of this plane vary between ice cold and boiling hot, and between saline and fresh. They are perpetually in motion, wracked by currents and tides. The plane&rsquo;s permanent settlements form around bits of flotsam suspended within this endless liquid, drifting on the tides.</p>\n<p>The Plane of Water is a seemingly endless ocean with neither surface nor floor, a sunken realm that lies between the Planes of Air and Earth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With the Plane of Air serving as a vast sky and the Plane of Earth forming its floor, the Plane of Water is a breathtaking, endless ocean of salt and fresh water alike. Generally growing more saline with increased proximity to the Plane of Earth, the Boundless Sea nonetheless contains within its primeval tides vast pockets of pristine fresh water, salt-choked dead seas, freshwater rivers flowing in tandem with ocean currents, and even enormous bubbles of floating air, all of which contain their own unique and vibrant ecosystems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sprinkled throughout the plane are even stranger features, such as enchanted springs that bubble into underwater pools, warping whatever wildlife lives within them, and pockets of acid and poison that form roiling lagoons and refuse to dilute into the surrounding ocean. Enormous, whirling torrents of blood and chum, too large to have formed through organic means, sustain environments incomprehensibly alien to all but the most savvy natives of this plane. Although the Boundless Sea&rsquo;s temperature is largely tepid, strong currents of ice-cold and boiling-hot water thread throughout it, imperiling those unfamiliar with the terrain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most of the plane is liquid, but foreign elements can be found here as well, having fallen into the plane over the eons. For instance, hunks of rock from the Plane of Earth form vast floating reefs alongside fragments of lost cities and forgotten worlds. Enormous chunks of ice have also meandered into the Boundless Sea from the Plane of Air; on many such solid escarpments natives have constructed bustling cities, often alongside small populations of ice elementals. Jagged spires of solidified magma reach straight into the Endless Sky, while a handful of sunken spheres from the Plane of Fire light some portions of the seas, burning like underwater stars. The Boundless Sea&rsquo;s other light sources include gently filtered light from the Plane of Air and, near where it meets the Plane of Earth, massive, roving schools of luminescent fish.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Denizens</h2>\n<p>Though civilization exists only in pockets of the Boundless Sea, water-breathing life-forms of all types thrive on this elemental plane. Merfolk, sahuagin, and numerous other humanoids dwell in the endless depths, gathering in villages, cities, or even nations, while deadly monsters like krakens and scyllas are less common but much feared. Unlike their kin on the Plane of Air, elementals and mephits native to the Plane of Water do not gather in groups. Water elementals act much like brutal beasts of the wild, while mephits prefer to lurk in the nooks and crannies of other societies. The petitioners known as water pneumas, like other pneumas, are short-lived and swift to make the transition into elementals once they arrive on the Plane of Water. The most significant denizens of the plane are explored below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Brine Dragons</h3>\n<p>Past the Boundless Sea&rsquo;s salinity interchange, the Plane of Water teems with brine dragons. Although most scholars assume that the dragons bask aimlessly in the plane&rsquo;s saltier depths, in reality most live there at the behest of their elemental lord.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Marids</h3>\n<p>The Boundless Sea&rsquo;s water genies claim to be the absolute and rightful rulers of the Plane of Water in its entirety, but in truth, the disparate marid nations have been divided for nearly 10,000 years. Visitors to the Boundless Sea tend to find that the marids are some of its more accessible natives. Marid society follows very strong rules of hospitality, meant to help facilitate peace between members of their notoriously capricious race. Marids also enjoy foreign visitors and performers for their own sake, and the genies go out of their way to invite and support such guests. Many marid cities have a foreign quarter that provides food and breathable air, and nobles eagerly welcome opportunities to do business with surface dwellers. The lack of safe, reliable, and organized transport routes between the marid settlements, however, means such trade is infrequent at best.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Merfolk</h3>\n<p>Merfolk immigrants to the Plane of Water prefer to dwell in dimly lit waters, while their deep merfolk kin keep to the lightless seas near the border with the Plane of Earth. Merfolk are a secretive people, going to great lengths to avoid other races and keep intruders out of their domains. An explorer is more likely to merely feel the presence of merfolk than to actually see one, as merfolk weave complex webs of illusion, build decoy cities, and construct misleading trails to lead curious outsiders miles away from their true homes. They have also been known to relocate or even destroy sites of significance to keep adventurers from finding them. This causes no end of frustration for other denizens of the plane, from knowledgeseekers to travelers who simply need stable landmarks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Sahuagin</h3>\n<p>Often dismissed as simple savages, the sahuagin of the Plane of Water are entrenched planar immigrants whose strength should not be underestimated. The Boundless Sea&rsquo;s sahuagin originated from the Material Plane and, they say, alighted here several thousand years ago to fulfill a prophecy. While well known for quick and vicious invasions of neighboring kingdoms, these sahuagin are even more infamous for fighting among themselves. Most major nobles in their cities claim lineage back to the first sahuagin emperor. Sahuagin warlords are some of the most adaptable residents of the Plane of Water, grasping for any advantages they can find to bring them to greater heights of conquest and power.</p>"}

You can cast such a spell either before or after you take a move action.</p>\n<p>Note: You retain your Dexterity bonus to AC while casting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spell Components</h2>\n<p>To cast a spell with a verbal (V) component, your character must speak in a firm voice. If you&rsquo;re gagged or in the area of a silence spell, you can&rsquo;t cast such a spell. A spellcaster who has been deafened has a 20% chance to spoil any spell he tries to cast if that spell has a verbal component.</p>\n<p>To cast a spell with a somatic (S) component, you must gesture freely with at least one hand. You can&rsquo;t cast a spell of this type while bound, grappling, or with both your hands full or occupied.</p>\n<p>To cast a spell with a material (M), focus (F), or divine focus (DF) component, you have to have the proper materials, as described by the spell. Unless these components are elaborate, preparing them is a free action. For material components and focuses whose costs are not listed in the spell description, you can assume that you have them if you have your spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Concentration</h2>\n<p>You must concentrate to cast a spell. If you can&rsquo;t concentrate, you can&rsquo;t cast a spell. If you start casting a spell but something interferes with your concentration, you must make a concentration check or lose the spell. The check&rsquo;s DC depends on what is threatening your concentration (see Chapter 9). If you fail, the spell fizzles with no effect. If you prepare spells, it is lost from preparation. If you cast at will, it counts against your daily limit of spells even though you did not cast it successfully.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Concentrating to Maintain a Spell</h2>\n<p>Some spells require continued concentration to keep them going. Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action that doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity. Anything that could break your concentration when casting a spell can keep you from concentrating to maintain a spell. If your concentration breaks, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Casting Time</h2>\n<p>Most spells have a casting time of 1 standard action. A spell cast in this manner immediately takes effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Attacks of Opportunity</h2>\n<p>Generally, if you cast a spell, you provoke attacks of opportunity from threatening enemies. If you take damage from an attack of opportunity, you must make a concentration check (DC 10 + points of damage taken + the spell&rsquo;s level) or lose the spell.</p>\n<p>Spells that require only a swift action to cast don&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Casting on the Defensive</h2>\n<p>Casting a spell while on the defensive does not provoke an attack of opportunity. It does, however, require a concentration check (DC 15 + double the spell&rsquo;s level) to successfully cast the spell. Failure means that you lose the spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Touch Spells in Combat</h2>\n<p>Many spells have a range of touch. To use these spells, you cast the spell and then touch the subject. In the same round that you cast the spell, you may also touch (or attempt to touch) as a free action. You may take your move before casting the spell, after touching the target, or between casting the spell and touching the target. You can automatically touch one friend or use the spell on yourself, but to touch an opponent, you must succeed on an attack roll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Touch Attacks</h2>\n<p>Touching an opponent with a touch spell is considered to be an armed attack and therefore does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The act of casting a spell, however, does provoke an attack of opportunity. Touch attacks come in two types: melee touch attacks and ranged touch attacks. You can score critical hits with either type of attack as long as the spell deals damage. Your opponent&rsquo;s AC against a touch attack does not include any armor bonus, shield bonus, or natural armor bonus. His size modifier, Dexterity modifier, and deflection bonus (if any) all apply normally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Holding the Charge</h2>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t discharge the spell in the round when you cast the spell, you can hold the charge indefinitely. You can continue to make touch attacks round after round. If you touch anything or anyone while holding a charge, even unintentionally, the spell discharges. If you cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates. You can touch one friend as a standard action or up to six friends as a full-round action. Alternatively, you may make a normal unarmed attack (or an attack with a natural weapon) while holding a charge.

Adventures that take place in cities have two salient differences from their dungeon counterparts, however. Characters have greater access to resources, and they must contend with law enforcement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Access to Resources</h2>\n<p>Unlike in dungeons and the wilderness, characters can buy and sell gear quickly in a city. A large city or metropolis probably has high-level NPCs and experts in obscure fields of knowledge who can provide assistance and decipher clues. And when the PCs are battered and bruised, they can retreat to the comfort of a room at an inn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The freedom to retreat and ready access to the marketplace means that the players have a greater degree of control over the pacing of an urban adventure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Law Enforcement</h2>\n<p>The other key distinctions between adventuring in a city and delving into a dungeon is that a dungeon is, almost by definition, a lawless place where the only law is that of the jungle: kill or be killed. A city, on the other hand, is held together by a code of laws, many of which are explicitly designed to prevent the sort of killing and looting that adventurers engage in all the time.</p>\n<p>Even so, most cities&rsquo; laws recognize monsters as a threat to the stability the city relies on, and prohibitions about murder rarely apply to monsters such as aberrations or evil outsiders. Most evil humanoids, however, are typically protected by the same laws that protect all the citizens of the city. Having an evil alignment is not a crime (except in some severely theocratic cities, perhaps, with the magical power to back up the law); only evil deeds are against the law.</p>\n<p>Even when adventurers encounter an evildoer in the act of perpetrating some heinous evil upon the populace of the city, the law tends to frown on the sort of vigilante justice that leaves the evildoer dead or otherwise unable to testify at a trial.</p>"}

Water affects a creature&rsquo;s attack rolls, damage, and movement. In some cases a creature&rsquo;s opponents might get a bonus on attacks. The effects are summarized on Table 13&ndash;7. They apply whenever a character is swimming, walking in chest-deep water, or walking along the bottom of a body of water.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ranged Attacks Underwater</h2>\n<p>Thrown weapons are ineffective underwater, even when launched from land. Attacks with other ranged weapons take a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water they pass through, in addition to the normal penalties for range.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Attacks from Land</h2>\n<p>Characters swimming, floating, or treading water on the surface, or wading in water at least chest deep, have improved cover (+8 bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) from opponents on land. Land-bound opponents who have freedom of movement effects ignore this cover when making melee attacks against targets in the water. A completely submerged creature has total cover against opponents on land unless those opponents have freedom of movement effects. Magical effects are unaffected except for those that require attack rolls (which are treated like any other effects) and fire effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fire</h2>\n<p>Nonmagical fire (including alchemist&rsquo;s fire) does not burn underwater. Spells or spell-like effects with the fire descriptor are ineffective underwater unless the caster makes a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level). If the check succeeds, the spell creates a bubble of steam instead of its usual fiery effect, but otherwise the spell works as described. A supernatural fire effect is ineffective underwater unless its description states otherwise. The surface of a body of water blocks line of effect for any fire spell. If the caster has made the caster level check to make the fire spell usable underwater, the surface still blocks the spell&rsquo;s line of effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Spellcasting Underwater</h2>\n<p>Casting spells while submerged can be difficult for those who cannot breathe underwater. A creature that cannot breathe water must make a concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell underwater (this is in addition to the caster level check to successfully cast a fire spell underwater). Creatures that can breathe water are unaffected and can cast spells normally. Some spells might function differently underwater, subject to GM discretion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 13-7: Combat Adjustments Underwater</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 99.0354%; height: 175px;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 23.9167%; height: 16px;\" scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 43.7955%; height: 16px;\" colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\">Attack/Damage</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 31.9188%; height: 16px;\" colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 36px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 23.9167%; height: 36px;\" scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0058%; height: 36px;\" scope=\"col\">Slashing or Bludgeoning</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.7897%; height: 36px;\" scope=\"col\">Piercing</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.9742%; height: 36px;\" scope=\"col\">Movement</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.9446%; height: 36px;\" scope=\"col\">Off Balance?<sup>1</sup></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 33px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 23.9167%; height: 33px;\">Freedom of movement</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0058%; height: 33px;\">normal/normal</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.7897%; height: 33px;\">normal/normal</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.9742%; height: 33px;\">normal</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.9446%; height: 33px;\">No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 23.9167%; height: 16px;\">Has a swim speed</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0058%; height: 16px;\">-2/half</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.7897%; height: 16px;\">normal</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.9742%; height: 16px;\">normal</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.9446%; height: 16px;\">No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 36px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 23.9167%; height: 36px;\">Successful Swim check</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0058%; height: 36px;\">-2/half<sup>2</sup></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.7897%; height: 36px;\">normal</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.9742%; height: 36px;\">quarter or half<sup>3</sup></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.9446%; height: 36px;\">No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 19px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 23.9167%; height: 19px;\">Firm footing<sup>4</sup></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0058%; height: 19px;\">-2/half<sup>2</sup></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.7897%; height: 19px;\">normal</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.9742%; height: 19px;\">half</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.9446%; height: 19px;\">No</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 19px;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 23.9167%; height: 19px;\">None of the above</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 27.0058%; height: 19px;\">-2/half<sup>2</sup></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.7897%; height: 19px;\">-2/half</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 16.9742%; height: 19px;\">normal</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.9446%; height: 19px;\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>1</strong> Creatures flailing about in the water (usually because they failed their @Compendium[pf1.skills.weCPHUuXi9sF5r4E]{Swim} checks) have a hard time fighting effectively.

Breaking Items}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 173</em></p>\n<p>Smashing a weapon or shield with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon is accomplished with the sunder combat maneuver (see Chapter 8). Smashing an object is like sundering a weapon or shield, except that your combat maneuver check is opposed by the object&rsquo;s AC. Generally, you can smash an object only with a bludgeoning or slashing weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Armor Class</h2>\n<p>Objects are easier to hit than creatures because they don&rsquo;t usually move, but many are tough enough to shrug off some damage from each blow. An object&rsquo;s Armor Class is equal to 10 + its size modifier (see Table 7&ndash;11) + its Dexterity modifier. An inanimate object has not only a Dexterity of 0 (&ndash;5 penalty to AC), but also an additional &ndash;2 penalty to its AC. Furthermore, if you take a full-round action to line up a shot, you get an automatic hit with a melee weapon and a +5 bonus on attack rolls with a ranged weapon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hardness</h2>\n<p>Each object has hardness&mdash;a number that represents how well it resists damage. When an object is damaged, subtract its hardness from the damage. Only damage in excess of its hardness is deducted from the object&rsquo;s hit points (see Table 7&ndash;12, Table 7&ndash;13, and Table 7&ndash;14).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hit Points</h2>\n<p>An object&rsquo;s hit point total depends on what it is made of and how big it is (see Table 7&ndash;12, Table 7&ndash;13, and Table 7&ndash;14). Objects that take damage equal to or greater than half their total hit points gain the broken condition (see Appendix 2). When an object&rsquo;s hit points reach 0, it&rsquo;s ruined.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Very large objects have separate hit point totals for different sections.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Energy Attacks</h2>\n<p>Energy attacks deal half damage to most objects. Divide the damage by 2 before applying the object&rsquo;s hardness. Some energy types might be particularly effective against certain objects, subject to GM discretion. For example, fire might do full damage against parchment, cloth, and other objects that burn easily. Sonic might do full damage against glass and crystal objects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ranged Weapon Damage</h2>\n<p>Objects take half damage from ranged weapons (unless the weapon is a siege engine or something similar). Divide the damage dealt by 2 before applying the object&rsquo;s hardness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ineffective Weapons</h2>\n<p>Certain weapons just can&rsquo;t effectively deal damage to certain objects. Likewise, most melee weapons have little effect on stone walls and doors, unless they are designed for breaking up stone, such as a pick or hammer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Immunities</h2>\n<p>Objects are immune to nonlethal damage and to critical hits.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic Armor, Shields, and Weapons</h2>\n<p>Each +1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to the hardness of armor, a weapon, or a shield, and +10 to the item&rsquo;s hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vulnerability to Certain Attacks</h2>\n<p>Certain attacks are especially successful against some objects. In such cases, attacks deal double their normal damage and may ignore the object&rsquo;s hardness.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Damaged Objects</h2>\n<p>A damaged object remains functional with the broken condition until the item&rsquo;s hit points are reduced to 0, at which point it is destroyed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Damaged (but not destroyed) objects can be repaired with the Craft skill and a number of spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Saving Throws</h2>\n<p>Nonmagical, unattended items never make saving throws. They are considered to have failed their saving throws, so they are always fully affected by spells and other attacks that allow saving throws to resist or negate. An item attended by a character (being grasped, touched, or worn) makes saving throws as the character (that is, using the character&rsquo;s saving throw bonus).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Magic items always get saving throws. A magic item&rsquo;s Fortitude, Ref lex, and Will save bonuses are equal to 2 + half its caster level. An attended magic item either makes saving throws as its owner or uses its own saving throw bonus, whichever is better.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Animated Objects</h2>\n<p>Animated objects count as creatures for purposes of determining their Armor Class (do not treat them as inanimate objects).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 7-11: Size and Armor Class of Objects</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 39.5952%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 49.8008%;

Each of these methods gives a different level of flexibility and randomness to character generation.</p>\n<p><br />Racial modifiers (adjustments made to your ability scores due to your character&rsquo;s race&mdash;see Chapter 2) are applied after the scores are generated.</p>\n<h2>Standard</h2>\n<p>Roll 4d6, discard the lowest die result, and add the three remaining results together. Record this total and repeat the process until six numbers are generated. Assign these totals to your ability scores as you see fit. This method is less random than Classic and tends to create characters with above-average ability scores.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Classic</h2>\n<p>Roll 3d6 and add the dice together. Record this total and repeat the process until you generate six numbers. Assign these results to your ability scores as you see fit. This method is quite random, and some characters will have clearly superior abilities. This randomness can be taken one step further, with the totals applied to specific ability scores in the order they are rolled. Characters generated using this method are difficult to fit to predetermined concepts, as their scores might not support given classes or personalities, and instead are best designed around their ability scores.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Heroic</h2>\n<p>Roll 2d6 and add 6 to the sum of the dice. Record this total and repeat the process until six numbers are generated. Assign these totals to your ability scores as you see fit. This is less random than the Standard method and generates characters with mostly above-average scores.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dice Pool</h2>\n<p>Each character has a pool of 24d6 to assign to his statistics. Before the dice are rolled, the player selects the number of dice to roll for each score, with a minimum of 3d6 for each ability. Once the dice have been assigned, the player rolls each group and totals the result of the three highest dice. For more high-powered games, the GM should increase the total number of dice to 28. This method generates characters of a similar power to the Standard method.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Purchase</h2>\n<p>Each character receives a number of points to spend on increasing his basic attributes. In this method, all attributes start at a base of 10. A character can increase an individual score by spending some of his points. Likewise, he can gain more points to spend on other scores by decreasing one or more of his ability scores. No score can be reduced below 7 or raised above 18 using this method. See Table 1&ndash;1 on the next page for the costs of each score. After all the points are spent, apply any racial modifiers the character might have.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The number of points you have to spend using the purchase method depends on the type of campaign you are playing. The standard value for a character is 15 points. Average nonplayer characters (NPCs) are typically built using as few as 3 points. See Table 1&ndash;2 on the next page for a number of possible point values depending on the style of campaign. The purchase method emphasizes player choice and creates equally balanced characters. This system is typically used for organized play events, such as the Pathfinder Society (visit paizo.com/pathfinderSociety for more details on this exciting campaign).</p>\n<h2>Table 1-1: Ability Score Costs</h2>\n<table style=\"height: 300px; width: 33.8623%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.2051%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\" scope=\"col\">Score</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.1538%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\" scope=\"col\">Points</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.2051%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">7</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.1538%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">-4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.2051%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.1538%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">-2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.2051%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.1538%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.2051%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.1538%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.2051%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">11</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.1538%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.2051%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">12</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.1538%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.2051%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">13</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.1538%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.2051%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">14</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.1538%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.2051%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">15</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.1538%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.2051%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">16</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.1538%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.2051%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">17</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.1538%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 16px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 48.2051%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">18</td>\n<td style=\"width: 51.1538%; height: 16px; text-align: center;\">17</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2><br />Table 1-2: Ability Score Points</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 41.943%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 72.6923%;\" scope=\"col\">Campaign Type</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 26.6667%;\" scope=\"col\">Points</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 72.6923%;\">Low Fantasy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 26.6667%;\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 72.6923%;\">Standard Fantasy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 26.6667%;\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 72.6923%;\">High Fantasy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 26.6667%;\">20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 72.6923%;\">Epic Fantasy</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 26.6667%;\">25</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Such weapons overcome every demon&rsquo;s natural resistances, and are one of the few types of weapons that all demons fear equally. When dealing with demons, it is best to remember that they abide by no contract other than power, and displaying power&mdash;or at least hints of it&mdash;is key to keeping them under control. Their magic circle is made of powdered cold iron.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All demons are immune to electricity and poison effects. Many have other resistances based on their forms and chaotic natures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Babau (SR 17)</h2>\n<p>Any sacrifice for a babau must involve an intelligent creature, which the demon must be allowed to rend and utterly destroy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Balor (SR 31)</h2>\n<p>Balors do not come when summoned, and actively resist calls. Only the offer of a bound CR 15 lawful or good outsider, or a helpless paladin or cleric of 15th level or higher, dims their rage at being snatched from their home. Even thus placated, they will surely seek revenge unless the mortal they face demonstrates a greater power.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Dretch</h2>\n<p>As the slave labor of the infinite Abyss, the lot of the dretch would be pitiable if the creature weren&rsquo;t so contemptible. The best sacrifice for a dretch is the promise that it can spend at least a third of its time in servitude resting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Glabrezu (SR 24)</h2>\n<p>These treacherous demons peddle in secrets that destroy, and to bring them to the Material Plane as interested negotiators, the caster must know secrets that can destroy influential families, bring down nations, or otherwise befoul the bedrock of society.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hezrou (SR 22)</h2>\n<p>Expensive poisons and powerful potions worth at least 500 gp can pique the interest of these toadlike demons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Marilith (SR 28)</h2>\n<p>Either powerful magic weapons (+2 enchantment or greater) or the promise of the command of armies of cults can lure a marilith; any offer less than this earns the caster a &ndash;6 penalty on the Charisma check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Kalavakus (SR 21)</h2>\n<p>These horned demons almost always barter for slaves in return of their services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nabasu (SR 19)</h2>\n<p>These demons love nothing more than devouring or enslaving humanoids so they can grow fatter and stronger.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Nalfeshnee (SR 25)</h2>\n<p>These demons love knowledge, especially that within their specialties of manipulation and greed. Nalfeshnees bargain knowledge for knowledge, but never give more than they gain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Omox (SR 23)</h2>\n<p>These slimy demons enjoy the destruction of beautiful things. For their services, they often take &ldquo;gifts&rdquo; that involve the destruction of beautiful things&mdash;in particular an attractive young man or woman as sacrifice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Quasit</h2>\n<p>Even more pathetic than the dretch, the quasit seeks only the assurance that it can return to the Abyss when its task is complete.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shadow Demon (SR 17)</h2>\n<p>The shadow demon asks merely for the shell of a beautiful person to wear for the duration of its servitude. It does not care whether that shell is pure or impure.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shemhazian (SR 27)</h2>\n<p>These powerful demons serve mortal spellcasters for only one price&mdash;when their service is done, they get to kill and devour the binder. This makes attempts to control them very rare. Sometimes they demand the life of the binder&rsquo;s family or friends as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Succubus (SR 18)</h2>\n<p>The primary joy of the succubus is in destroying innocence and love; offering a child, virgin, or a beloved family member of the caster suffices to gain the interest of the succubus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vrock (SR 20)</h2>\n<p>The vrock loves to despoil and befoul things of great beauty. Artwork worth at least 250 gp or a living, intelligent creature to destroy are equally desirable sacrifices. As their dance of ruin attack is more powerful the more vrocks are involved, they are often conjured and bribed in groups.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vrolikai (SR 30)</h2>\n<p>These transformed nabasus hate being summoned to the Material Plane, believing their time there is over and they are meant for greater things. When summoned, they typically ask for twice the normal amount in gifts. These demands are often accompanied by outrageous, sometimes impossible demands. They can eventually be reasoned with, but only when binders demonstrate power over them.</p>"}

How Planes Interact}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 440</em></p>\n<p>While endless adventure awaits out in the game&mdash;there are other worlds beyond these&mdash;other continents, other planets, other galaxies. Yet even beyond this existence of countless planets exist more worlds&mdash;entirely different dimensions of reality known as the planes of existence. Except for rare linking points that allow travel between them, each plane is effectively its own universe with its own natural laws. Collectively, the entirety of these other dimensions and planes is known as the Great Beyond.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although the number of planes is limited only by imagination, they can all be categorized into five general types: the Material Plane, the transitive planes, the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, and the countless demiplanes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Occult Adventures pg. 238</em></p>\n<p>The planes of the Great Beyond encompass all of existence, from the simple and sublime wonders of the material world to the impossibilities of heavens, hells, and everything in between. Arcane tradition conceptualizes this multiverse of planes as a series of nesting spheres, with each layer and the spaces between representing different vistas of reality. At the center of it all, suspended within the silvery seas of the Astral Plane, lies the Inner Sphere of the Elemental and Material Planes. The Elemental Planes are the raw building blocks of the multiverse, while the planes aligned with positive and negative energy govern the forces of life and death, creation and destruction. The invisible mists and eddies of the Ethereal Plane connect and interpenetrate the worlds of the Inner Sphere, just as the Astral Plane connects these worlds in turn to the infinite realms of the Outer Sphere, the domains of gods and the final destination for the souls of the multiverse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The esoteric tradition, sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;ancient wisdom,&rdquo; acknowledges the many planes, demiplanes, and corners of the Inner and Outer Spheres, but tends to focus more on the Inner Sphere than the realms of the deities. Scholars of occultism believe that their investigations reveal a hidden truth behind the multiverse, and that mastering the implications of this secret can give an adept power over not just her mortal life, but also her life after death. She can then enter a cycle of reincarnation that allows, over successive cycles of existence and reflection, the complete mastery of body, mind, and soul, opening up new vistas of consciousness and immortality.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Consequently, the adept does not concern herself with the courts of petitioners enjoying their final reward or laboring eternally under fiendish masters, nor with the raw building blocks of the material world such as air, earth, fire, and water. Her final personal journey into a more evolved existence is loftier than the base elements, and more self-determined than the proscribed fate of the pious petitioner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The orthodox view of the planes sees two opposing forces underlying existence in the multiverse: positive and negative energy. Each of these primal forces commands a vast plane of its own at the core of the Inner Sphere. The Positive Energy Plane is the source of life, and the Negative Energy Plane is the source of death; each exists as antithesis to the other. The great secret of occultism holds that rather than positive and negative energy being conflicting forces, they are in fact two halves of a single whole. Their polarity is not a sign of opposition, but rather two integral aspects of a single dualistic cycle. The positive aspect of this duality is the Cosmic Fire, the breath of life that grants vital force to living creatures. The Negative Energy Plane is the intake of that same breath, a return to dust, the recycling of component parts to pave the way for that which comes next.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Delving deeper into the ancient wisdom reveals even more enticing secrets regarding the nature of existence. Among the oldest creatures in the Great Beyond are the enigmatic outsiders known as aeons, who are said to be the caretakers of reality and the original architects and crafters of the multiverse itself. Befitting the esoteric view of the planes, these primordial beings always manifest a powerful dichotomy sustained in equilibrium: Birth and death. Fate and freedom. Creation and destruction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The aeons believe they are bound in a supreme oneness with the multiverse known as the &ldquo;monad,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;condition of all,&rdquo; the transcendental undersoul of all living creatures. They equate this oneness with both the life-giving Cosmic Fire of the Positive Energy Plane and the destructive void of the Negative Energy Plane. Furthermore, they do not limit this cosmic oneness to themselves, but rather include all of the multiverse&rsquo;s creatures within their concept of the monad. A human and a pleroma aeon are both emanations of the cosmic flame&mdash;the aeon is simply much closer to the source and believes itself to be in communication with it, whereas the monadic soul of a human is esoterically distant from the Fire, being focused primarily on the mortal affairs of the base Material Plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imagine a blazing sphere of brilliant energy blocked by a thick screen. This sphere represents the Cosmic Fire. Now imagine multitudes of tiny holes in the screen, each allowing some of the light to shine through. From the exoteric viewpoint of the uninitiated, each pinpoint of light appears distinct and unique. The esoteric perspective looks behind the screen and understands that all of the individual lights are but rays from a single source. A creature&rsquo;s soul is like one glimmering light in that screen&rsquo;s field of stars, and when mortal scholars speak of &ldquo;a monad,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re usually referring to this individual-seeming expression of the universal undersoul, at once a unique entity and part of the common soul of the multiverse. The greater an adept understands her place in this scheme, the more power she holds over her eternal destiny.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The short summaries below offer an occult viewpoint on the realms generally referred to as the Esoteric Planes. Many prominent planes in the orthodox scheme, such as the Shadow Plane and Elemental Planes, do not feature prominently in the cosmology of the adept concerned with multiversal truths and the journey of the mortal soul. Occultism freely acknowledges the existence of these planes, but does not dwell on them, an approach likewise observed here. For more information on these planes, including their planar traits, see the GameMastery Guide.</p>"}

The earliest authors of fantasy and weird fiction often included guns in their stories. Heroes like Burroughs&rsquo;s John Carter or Howard&rsquo;s Solomon Kane carried pistols alongside their swords, and it&rsquo;s hard to imagine a pirate ship without cannons blazing. These authors likely included guns because they are exciting, but also because the guns they chose were primitive ones&mdash; relatively unpredictable weapons, prone to misfire and malfunction. This made firearms excellent storytelling devices. Such weapons could cause hero or villain to falter or triumph, changing the action within the tale in a flash or a fizzle. Still, a firearm remains an ominous and terrible weapon in the hands of a skilled gunman.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This section presents an anachronistic collection of hand-held black powder weapons. Most of them are singleshot muzzle-loaders with highly inefficient triggering mechanisms&mdash;traditional sword and sorcery firearms. More advanced firearms are also presented for those brave enough to mix their fantasy with a technology much closer to that of the Old West than the slow and unstable weapons that gave musketeers their name. If you are interested in letting such weapons in your game, do so with the following warning: Advanced guns can substantially change the assumptions of your game world, in the same way that they changed the face of warfare in the real world. If you like your fantasy to be of the more traditional variety, stand clear. Or, better yet, run for cover.</p>"}

Hit points, ability scores, and levels are all depletable statistics&mdash;a creature falls unconscious below 0 hit points and eventually dies; objects, undead, and constructs are destroyed at 0 hit points; creatures are made helpless or killed by bringing an ability score to 0; creatures die when their negative levels equal their total Hit Dice. Many magical attacks and most nonmagical attacks reduce a target&rsquo;s depletable statistics in some way, eventually defeating the target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, attack bonuses, saving throw bonuses, Armor Class, hardness, CMB, CMD, initiative, speed, skill modifiers, and most other game statistics are not depletable statistics because no matter how low these statistics get, the affected creature or object is still able to take actions. For example, a spell that gives a target a &ndash;10 attack penalty has little effect on a sorcerer casting fireball, as would a spell that gave her a &ndash;10 penalty on her Will saving throws; despite her poor attack rolls and miserable Will saves, she is still quite capable of blasting her opponents to bits, whether these penalties are &ndash;10 or &ndash;100. Similarly, a fighter with a &ndash;10 penalty on Fortitude saving throws can still swing a sword, as can one with a &ndash;10 penalty to Armor Class; the fighter is still viable despite these penalties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Depletable statistic&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t an official game term, but it is a helpful concept when comparing power levels of spells&mdash;attacking depletable statistics is a war of attrition that can eventually wear down the target, whereas adding penalties to non-depletable statistics may have no effect at all, as the target may have other attacks that allow them to ignore those penalties.</p>"}

The druid's class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to an animal companion for the purpose of determining the companion's statistics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>HD</h2>\n<p>This is the total number of eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice the animal companion possesses, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>BAB</h2>\n<p>This is the animal companion's base attack bonus. An animal companion's base attack bonus is the same as that of a druid of a level equal to the animal's HD. Animal companions do not gain additional attacks using their natural weapons for a high base attack bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fort/Ref/Will</h2>\n<p>These are the animal companion's base saving throw bonuses. An animal companion has good Fortitude and Reflex saves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skills</h2>\n<p>This lists the animal's total skill ranks. Animal companions can assign skill ranks to any skill listed under Animal Skills. If an animal companion increases its Intelligence to 10 or higher, it gains bonus skill ranks as normal. Animal companions with an Intelligence of 3 or higher can purchase ranks in any skill. An animal companion cannot have more ranks in a skill than it has Hit Dice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Feats</h2>\n<p>This is the total number of feats possessed by an animal companion. Animal companions should select their feats from those listed under Animal Feats. Animal companions can select other feats, although they are unable to utilize some feats (such as Martial Weapon Proficiency). Note that animal companions cannot select a feat with a requirement of base attack bonus +1 until they gain their second feat at 3 Hit Dice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Natural Armor Bonus</h2>\n<p>The number noted here is an improvement to the animal companion's existing natural armor bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Str/Dex Bonus</h2>\n<p>Add this modifier to the animal companion's Strength and Dexterity scores.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bonus Tricks</h2>\n<p>The value given in this column is the total number of &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; tricks that the animal knows in addition to any that the druid might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill for more details on how to teach an animal tricks). These bonus tricks don't require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don't count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. The druid selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can't be changed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Special</h2>\n<p>This includes a number of abilities gained by animal companions as they increase in power. Each of these bonuses is described below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Link (Ex)</strong>: A druid can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn't have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Share Spells (Ex)</strong>: The druid may cast a spell with a target of &ldquo;You&rdquo; on her animal companion (as a spell with a range of touch) instead of on herself. A druid may cast spells on her animal companion even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion's type (animal). Spells cast in this way must come from a class that grants an animal companion. This ability does not allow the animal to share abilities that are not spells, even if they function like spells.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Evasion (Ex)</strong>: If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase (Ex)</strong>: The animal companion adds +1 to one of its ability scores.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Devotion (Ex)</strong>: An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Multiattack:</strong> An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second attack with one of its natural weapons, albeit at a &ndash;5 penalty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Improved Evasion (Ex)</strong>: When subjected to an attack that allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an animal companion takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Animal Skills</h2>\n<p>Animal companions can have ranks in any of the following skills:</p>\n<p>Acrobatics* (Dex), Climb* (Str), Escape Artist (Dex), Fly* (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Perception* (Wis), Stealth* (Dex), Survival (Wis), and Swim* (Str). All of the skills marked with an (*) are class skills for animal companions. Animal companions with an Intelligence of 3 or higher can put ranks into any skill.</p>"}

Subraces}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 14</em></p>\n<p>From the sly rogue to the stalwart paladin, the Pathfinder RPG allows you to make the character you want to play. When generating a character, start with your character&rsquo;s concept. Do you want a character who goes toe-to-toe with terrible monsters, matching sword and shield against claws and fangs? Or do you want a mystical seer who draws his powers from the great beyond to further his own ends? Nearly anything is possible.</p>\n<p>Once you have a general concept worked out, use the following steps to bring your idea to life, recording the resulting information and statistics on your Pathfinder RPG character sheet, which can be found at the back of this book and photocopied for your convenience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 1&mdash; Determine Ability Scores</h2>\n<p>Start by generating your character&rsquo;s ability scores. These six scores determine your character&rsquo;s most basic attributes and are used to decide a wide variety of details and statistics. Some class selections require you to have better than average scores for some of your abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 2&mdash;Pick Your Race</h2>\n<p>Next, pick your character&rsquo;s race, noting any modifiers to your ability scores and any other racial traits (see Chapter 2). There are seven basic races to choose from, although your GM might have others to add to the list. Each race lists the languages your character automatically knows, as well as a number of bonus languages. A character knows a number of additional bonus languages equal to his or her Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 3&mdash;Pick Your Class</h2>\n<p>A character&rsquo;s class represents a profession, such as fighter or wizard. If this is a new character, he starts at 1st level in his chosen class. As he gains experience points (XP) for defeating monsters, he goes up in level, granting him new powers and abilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 4&mdash;Pick Skills and Select Feats</h2>\n<p>Determine the number of skill ranks possessed by your character, based on his class and Intelligence modifier (and any other bonuses, such as the bonus received by humans). Then spend these ranks on skills, but remember that you cannot have more ranks than your level in any one skill (for a starting character, this is usually one). After skills, determine how many feats your character receives, based on his class and level, and select them from those presented in Chapter 5.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 5&mdash;Buy Equipment</h2>\n<p>Each new character begins the game with an amount of gold, based on his class, that can be spent on a wide range of equipment and gear, from chainmail armor to leather backpacks. This gear helps your character survive while adventuring. Generally speaking, you cannot use this starting money to buy magic items without the consent of your GM.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Step 6&mdash;Finishing Details</h2>\n<p>Finally, you need to determine all of a character&rsquo;s details, including his starting hit points (hp), Armor Class (AC), saving throws, initiative modifier, and attack values. All of these numbers are determined by the decisions made in previous steps.</p>\n<p>A level 1 character begins with maximum hit points for its Hit Die roll. Aside from these, you need to decide on your character&rsquo;s name, alignment, and physical appearance. It is best to jot down a few personality traits as well, to help you play the character during the game. Additional rules (like age and alignment) are described in Chapter 7.</p>"}

A character can make a touch attack with his hands or a weapon into two adjacent 5-foot squares using a standard action. If an invisible target is in the designated area, there is a 50% miss chance on the touch attack. If successful, the groping character deals no damage but has successfully pinpointed the invisible creature&rsquo;s current location. If the invisible creature moves, its location, obviously, is once again unknown.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If an invisible creature strikes a character, the character struck knows the location of the creature that struck him (until, of course, the invisible creature moves). The only exception is if the invisible creature has a reach greater than 5 feet. In this case, the struck character knows the general location of the creature but has not pinpointed the exact location.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has pinpointed, he attacks normally, but the invisible creature still benefits from full concealment (and thus a 50% miss chance). A particularly large and slow invisible creature might get a smaller miss chance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose location he has not pinpointed, have the player choose the space where the character will direct the attack. If the invisible creature is there, conduct the attack normally. If the enemy&rsquo;s not there, roll the miss chance as if it were there and tell him that the character has missed, regardless of the result. That way the player doesn&rsquo;t know whether the attack missed because the enemy&rsquo;s not there or because you successfully rolled the miss chance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If an invisible character picks up a visible object, the object remains visible. An invisible creature can pick up a small visible item and hide it on his person (tucked in a pocket or behind a cloak) and render it effectively invisible. One could coat an invisible object with flour to at least keep track of its position (until the flour falls off or blows away).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Invisible creatures leave tracks. They can be tracked normally. Footprints in sand, mud, or other soft surfaces can give enemies clues to an invisible creature&rsquo;s location.</p>\n<p>An invisible creature in the water displaces water, revealing its location. The invisible creature, however, is still hard to see and benefits from concealment.</p>\n<p>A creature with the scent ability can detect an invisible creature as it would a visible one.</p>\n<p>A creature with the Blind-Fight feat has a better chance to hit an invisible creature. Roll the miss chance twice, and he misses only if both rolls indicate a miss. (Alternatively, make one 25% miss chance roll rather than two 50% miss chance rolls.)</p>\n<p>A creature with blindsight can attack (and otherwise interact with) creatures regardless of invisibility.</p>\n<p>An invisible burning torch still gives off light, as does an invisible object with a light or similar spell cast upon it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ethereal creatures (such as ghosts from the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary) are invisible. Since ethereal creatures are not materially present, Perception checks, scent, Blind- Fight, and blindsight don&rsquo;t help locate them. Incorporeal creatures are often invisible. Scent, Blind-Fight, and blindsight don&rsquo;t help creatures find or attack invisible, incorporeal creatures, but Perception checks can help.</p>\n<p>Invisible creatures cannot use gaze attacks.</p>\n<p>Invisibility does not thwart divination spells.</p>\n<p>Since some creatures can detect or even see invisible creatures, it is helpful to be able to hide even when invisible.</p>"}

Cold becomes extreme, and the lack of oxygen in the air can wear down even the most hardy of warriors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Acclimated Characters</h2>\n<p>Creatures accustomed to high altitude generally fare better than lowlanders. Any creature with an Environment entry that includes mountains is considered native to the area and acclimated to the high altitude. Characters can also acclimate themselves by living at high altitude for a month. Characters who spend more than two months away from the mountains must reacclimate themselves when they return. Undead, constructs, and other creatures that do not breathe are immune to altitude effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Altitude Zones</h2>\n<p>In general, mountains present three possible altitude bands: low pass, low peak/high pass, and high peak.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Low Pass (lower than 5,000 feet)</h2>\n<p>Most travel in low mountains takes place in low passes, a zone consisting largely of alpine meadows and forests. Travelers might find the going difficult (which is reflected in the movement modifiers for traveling through mountains), but the altitude itself has no game effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Low Peak or High Pass (5,000 to 15,000 feet)</h2>\n<p>Ascending to the highest slopes of low mountains, or most normal travel through high mountains, falls into this category. All non-acclimated creatures labor to breathe in the thin air at this altitude. Characters must succeed on a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or be fatigued. The fatigue ends when the character descends to an altitude with more air. Acclimated characters do not have to attempt the Fortitude save.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>High Peak (more than 15,000 feet)</h2>\n<p>The highest mountains exceed 15,000 feet in height. At these elevations, creatures are subject to both high altitude fatigue (as described above) and altitude sickness, whether or not they&rsquo;re acclimated to high altitudes. Altitude sickness represents long-term oxygen deprivation, and affects mental and physical ability scores. After each 6-hour period a character spends at an altitude of over 15,000 feet, he must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1 point of damage to all ability scores. Creatures acclimated to high altitude receive a +4 competence bonus on their saving throws to resist high altitude effects and altitude sickness, but eventually even seasoned mountaineers must abandon these dangerous elevations.</p>"}

The strong presence of Sarenrae&rsquo;s followers has led to a culture of forgiveness and understanding that is rare in other parts of Golarion, making it easier for half-orcs to thrive. Many desert half-orcs believe they are blessed by Sarenrae and become clerics or paladins of her church.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Feral</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Advanced Race Guide pg. 53</em><br />Half-orc children who are abandoned as infants or small children rarely survive in the wild, but a few manage to scrape out a meager existence as \"wild children,\" tough enough to live but completely uncivilized. Feral half-orcs have the forest walker and toothy alternate racial traits.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Jungle Half-Orcs (Rainkin)</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Heroes from the Fringe pg. 25</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bastards of Golarion pg. 12</em><br />In the jungles of the Mwangi Expanse, the few remaining orc tribes have been largely cut off from others of their kind. Isolated since the orc empires collapsed after the Age of Darkness, only a handful of oral retellings recall the true heritage of these orcs and half-orcs, and their culture diverges greatly from other orc societies. It is said that some early Mwangi tribes participated in arranged marriages with orcs, leading half-orc children to be associated with alliances and prosperity, and true or not, half-orcs have been a major part of these orc tribes for generations. Even in the present day, many orcs are willing to pay a large dowry to bring half-orcs into their villages, and orphaned half-orcs are happily adopted.<br /><br />Because they usually come from rich families, rainkin halforcs often receive better treatment than their orc or human cousins. This can create a self-fulfilling prophecy; because half-orc children receive the best care, protection, and training, they are usually stronger and more skilled than orcs or humans, increasing the desire to have half-orcs in a tribe. While jungle half-orcs typically have great pride and selfworth, many are also resentful of the high expectations placed on them from birth and angry to be treated like a commodity by so many. As a result, rainkin have trouble forming close bonds with non-half-orcs, so they often create close-knit groups between themselves. Some of these groups even grow large enough to break off and form their own tribes.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Mountain Clan</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Advanced Race Guide pg. 53</em><br />Half-orcs from the more mountainous regions tend to be more agile and alert to the echoing sounds of their homeland. Mountain clan half-orcs have the bestial and rock climber racial traits.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Mountain Half-Orcs (Cragkin)</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Heroes from the Fringe pg. 25</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bastards of Golarion pg. 13</em><br />Cragkin are widespread across Golarion, found across all the mountain ranges of western Avistan. Thanks to their thin frames and quick wits, mountain-born half-orcs excel at climbing and acrobatic stunts. Anything less than a vertical cliff face is traversable, and often even that isn&rsquo;t enough to stop them. To mountain half-orcs, obstacles are merely a foothold on their path to the top.<br /><br />Mountain orcs respect bravery, and cragkin have turned fearlessness and reckless abandon into a badge of honor. By using the terrain to their advantage against less surefooted enemies, they can attack from strange angles and gain advantages with just a few quick steps. They often take near-suicidal leaps to strike enemies from above, or trick enemies into falling to their deaths by leading them down impossible paths. Despite their great skill, accidents are common in this treacherous environment, and no one is surprised if one halforc returns after a raid and his companions do not.<br /><br />Many mountain half-orcs find a place among Shoanti and Ulfen settlements, where valor in battle is highly prized. As long as they are willing to respect the traditions of their adopted clans, they usually integrate well into these societies and contribute much to the community.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Mystic</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Advanced Race Guide pg. 53</em><br />Orc shamans are brutal teachers who sometimes kill or maim their most promising students in order to eliminate what could be a potential rival. Half-orcs who survive years of abuse by an orc shaman master are deeply scarred and altered by the experience. Shaman trainees learn early that cunning and luck are often the only things that offer a chance of survival. They have the shaman&rsquo;s apprentice and sacred tattoo alternate racial traits.<br /><br /></p>\n<h2 class=\"framing\"><img title=\"PFS Legal\" src=\"modules/pf-content/assets/PathfinderSocietySymbol.gif\" />&nbsp;Winter Half-Orcs (Frostkin)</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<em>Heroes from the Fringe pg. 26</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bastards of Golarion pg. 13</em><br />At the Crown of the World, nomadic clans of orcs live on the frozen wastes. The winter half-orcs that live among them are treated as the runts of the pack. However, strength in numbers is vital in the north, as many young do not survive the harsh winters. Even the weakest are provided for as long as they can prove their usefulness. Sewing, cooking, and child-rearing are all valued skills, and winter half-orcs who excel at these are treated better than most. Those who would rather prove their worth through their strength do so by hunting, as ritual combat is a frowned upon waste of energy and resources.<br /><br />While half-orcs are not well liked in the Linnorm Kingdoms, they may be able to find homes in the Ironbound Isles. Merchants traveling between Tian Xia and Avistan are often willing to hire on a half-orc as a guide and bodyguard across the Crown of the World. Winter half-orcs who migrate south into Irrisen can find an easier life in the growing half-orc communities, but they are unlikely to find any upward mobility unless they show skill at witchcraft.</p>"}

Driving Devices}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 174</em></p>\n<p>A vehicle in combat can become a target for attacks and can affect combatants with special vehicular maneuvers. The following are the rules for how a vehicle acts in the combat round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Initiative</h2>\n<p>A vehicle moves on its driver&rsquo;s initiative. If a driver delays or readies an action, the vehicle goes out of control, and does nothing except take the uncontrolled action until it stops or someone becomes its new driver.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Movement</h2>\n<p>At the start of the driver&rsquo;s turn, she makes a driving check to control the vehicle as detailed in the Driving Vehicles section. When doing so, she takes whatever action is required before doing anything else that turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vehicles usually ignore difficult terrain due to rubble and foliage, but treat steep inclines as difficult terrain, and depending on the vehicle type and GM judgment, they may be affected by other difficult terrain types as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vehicles and creatures that occupy vehicles can enter the spaces of other vehicles and creatures, though doing so usually provokes a vehicular overrun or ramming maneuver (see Vehicle Combat Maneuvers). A vehicle can even end its turn in the space of a creature or another vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Threatening</h2>\n<p>Vehicles cannot threaten areas, but their non-crew occupants can. A character driving a vehicle still threatens the squares around her, though she may have limited options for attack depending on the requirements of the device used to drive the vehicle. Creatures used as propulsion do not threaten areas, and are treated as part of the vehicle for purposes of vehicular combat maneuvers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Line of Sight and Cover</h2>\n<p>Vehicles typically grant their occupants partial cover (+2 to AC and +1 on Reflex saving throws) against those outside the vehicle, and may grant partial cover against opponents within the vehicles as well. Vehicles with more protection or internal chambers can offer greater cover and can even block line of sight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Jumping On or Off a Vehicle</h2>\n<p>Jumping on a vehicle is a normal jump of its distance assuming the vehicle has a deck or handholds within the character&rsquo;s height from the ground. Increase the DC of the Acrobatics check by 5 for every 30 feet of the vehicle&rsquo;s current speed. If the jumping creature is on a moving vehicle, calculate the increase in the Acrobatics skill check DC by calculating the difference between the current speeds of the two vehicles. For every difference of 30 feet (round up), the DC increases by 5.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, jumping onto a vehicle with a current speed of 90 feet increases the DC by 15 if the jumper is not also on a moving vehicle. If the jumper is on a moving vehicle, and that vehicle is moving at the same current speed as the vehicle the jumper wants to jump to, there is no increase to the DC. If the difference between their speeds is less than 30 feet, the DC of the Acrobatics check increases by 5. If it&rsquo;s between 30 and 60, it increases by 10, and so on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jumping off a vehicle onto the ground is considered a fall, and treated as if the fall were an additional 10 feet farther for every 30 feet of the vehicle&rsquo;s movement for the purposes of determining damage. Acrobatics can be used to soften this fall, and magic abilities such as feather fall can be used to negate the effects of jumping off a vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Taking Control of a VehicleIf a vehicle has no driver, any creature can take control of the vehicle as long as the creature is within the driving space of the vehicle and makes a driving check as a free action. The vehicle&rsquo;s driver can always give over control to another adjacent creature that is within the driving space of the vehicle as a free action. When a new creature becomes the driver, the vehicle moves on the new driver&rsquo;s turn, but not on the new driver&rsquo;s first turn after taking control of the vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a creature wants to take control of a vehicle from another forcefully, it must pull the driver off the controls as part of a grapple and take over the driving device as part of a pin. When a creature successfully pins a vehicle&rsquo;s driver, it can choose to end the grapple immediately. When it does, the creature moves the current driver 5 feet to any unoccupied space within the vehicle (this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity) and becomes the vehicle&rsquo;s new driver.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Attacks against Vehicles</h2>\n<p>A vehicle has a base Armor Class based on its size and other defenses the vehicle has. To calculate the vehicle&rsquo;s actual AC, add the current driver&rsquo;s driving skill modifier (or Wisdom modifier, if it is using that ability to drive the vehicle) to the vehicle&rsquo;s base AC. Touch attacks against a vehicle ignore its driver&rsquo;s driving skill or ability modifier; thus a vehicle&rsquo;s base AC is its touch AC. A vehicle is never considered flat-footed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A vehicle has a base saving throw listed in its stat block. This determines its base Fortitude and Reflex saving throw. A vehicle is immune to effects that require a Will saving throw (though drivers, crew members, passengers, and creatures providing muscle propulsion typically are not). To determine the vehicle&rsquo;s actual Fortitude and Reflex saving throws, add half the driver&rsquo;s driving skill modifier (or half the driver&rsquo;s Wisdom modifier) to the vehicle&rsquo;s base saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vehicles have hit points, but do not have ability scores, and are immune to ability score damage or drain. They are also immune to bleed damage. A vehicle that takes damage in excess of half its total hit points gains the broken condition. When a vehicle reaches 0 or fewer hit points, but has not yet reached negative hit points equal to the number of squares of its space, it is wrecked. When a vehicle reaches a negative number of hit points equal to the number of squares it takes up, it is destroyed (see Damaging a Vehicle).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unlike other objects, vehicles do not take half damage from energy attacks, but do take half damage from all ranged weapons except siege weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When attacking a vehicle, you can attack the vehicle&rsquo;s structure, occupant, propulsion, driving device, or conveyance (if any).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Attacking the Structure</h2>\n<p>This is an attack against the vehicle itself. If successful, the vehicle takes damage normally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Attacking an Occupant</h2>\n<p>This is a normal attack against an occupant creature. Occupants get partial cover or greater if the attack is coming from outside of the vehicle. Grappling the driver is one method for taking control of the vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Attacking Propulsion</h2>\n<p>Propulsion often has its own set of statistics, while creatures propelling a vehicle use their own statistics. Other types of propulsion have hit points and hardness determined by multiplying the values listed in the Propulsion Devices sidebar by the vehicle&rsquo;s total number of squares of that type. Individual vehicle stat blocks also detail their propulsion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a vehicle is being pulled by creatures, and any of those creatures is killed, dazed, stunned, or becomes unconscious, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop (see Sudden Stops). If a vehicle has a crew, and half or more of that crew is killed, dazed, stunned, or rendered unconscious, the vehicle can no longer be controlled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Attacking the Driving Device</h2>\n<p>A driving device is its own object with its own statistics. When a driving device gains the broken condition or is disabled, all driving checks are increased by 10. When a driving device is destroyed, the vehicle can no longer be driven. Driving devices are typically objects with object immunities and resistances. Attacking Conveyance: An attack against wheels, rudders, or similar forms of conveyance takes a &ndash;10 penalty on the attack roll, but does maximum damage to the vehicle (no roll necessary). If the attack is a critical hit, multiply this maximum damage by the critical multiplier of the attack. Conveyances are typically objects with object immunities and resistances.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 4-5: Vehicle AC and CMB Modifier by Size</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 55.7247%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 45.1983%;\" scope=\"col\">Vehicle Size</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1789%;\" scope=\"col\">AC</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.7246%;\" scope=\"col\">CMB Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 45.1983%;\">Large vehicle</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1789%;\">9</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.7246%;\">+1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 45.1983%;\">Huge vehicle</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1789%;\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.7246%;\">+2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 45.1983%;\">Gargantuan vehicle</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1789%;\">6</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.7246%;\">+4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 45.1983%;\">Colossal vehicle</td>\n<td style=\"width: 16.1789%;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 37.7246%;\">+8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vehicle Combat Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>Vehicles typically don&rsquo;t have attacks, though some can be fitted with siege weapons. A vehicle can make, and is often required to make, a vehicular bull rush, vehicular overrun, or ramming maneuver as part of its movement. Unlike creatures, a vehicle can enter the space of creatures or objects smaller than it, and when it does, it makes either a vehicular overrun or vehicular bull rush. When a vehicle hits a creature or a vehicle that is its size or larger, or it hits a solid object (a wall or structure that is immobile and has a hardness of 5 or more), it makes a ramming maneuver.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vehicular Overrun</h2>\n<p>Any time any part of a vehicle (including any creatures used as propulsion) enters the space of a creature or vehicle smaller than it, the driver must make a vehicular overrun combat maneuver against the creature or vehicle. This may require the driver to make vehicular overrun checks against the same creature numerous times as new parts of the vehicle enter its square.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When performing a vehicular overrun, the driver uses the base CMB of the vehicle plus her driving skill modifier (or Wisdom skill modifier if she is using that ability to drive the vehicle) as the CMB of the vehicular overrun. If the driver has feats that improve her CMB when overrunning, like the Improved Overrun feat, she may also add those modifiers and benefits to the vehicular overrun. Like a normal overrun, this action provokes an attack of opportunity from the creature being overrun, unless the driver has the Improved Overrun feat. The creature being overrun can make this attack of opportunity on any part of the vehicle that is within reach.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When a vehicular overrun is attempted, the target of the overrun may choose to avoid the vehicle, allowing the vehicle to pass through its space without requiring a vehicular overrun maneuver check. The creature or vehicle cannot avoid a maneuver check if the driver has the Improved Overrun feat, the vehicle is two or more size categories larger than the target, or the target creature is confused, dazed, entangled, flat-footed, helpless, paralyzed, prone, or stunned. If the target does not avoid the vehicle, make the combat maneuver check as normal. If the maneuver is successful, the vehicle moves through the target&rsquo;s space, and the target of the overrun takes the vehicle&rsquo;s ramming damage (see Table 4&ndash;3 for base ramming damage by size, and individual vehicle stat blocks for their own ramming damage). If the driver&rsquo;s combat maneuver check exceeds the target&rsquo;s CMD by 5 or more, the target takes twice the vehicle&rsquo;s ramming damage. If the target is a creature, it is also knocked prone. If the target has more than two legs, it gets a +2 bonus to its CMD for each additional leg it has. Vehicles that are overrun are knocked prone if the opposing driver&rsquo;s combat maneuver check result exceeds the vehicle&rsquo;s CMD by 10 or more. A vehicle that is knocked prone makes a sudden stop (see Sudden Stops).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It takes at least 5 full-round actions and a DC 25 Strength check from creatures adjacent to the vehicle to push a Large land or water vehicle up from being prone. For every size category that the vehicle is larger than size Large, increase the number of full-round actions by three and the Strength check DC by 5.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The driver of a prone air vehicle must succeed at a DC 25 Fly check immediately to avoid falling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A vehicle equipped with a ram deals +2d8 points of damage with a vehicular overrun.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vehicular Bull Rush</h2>\n<p>As a swift action, taken when the driver takes all but the &ldquo;uncontrolled&rdquo; action while driving the vehicle, a driver can choose to substitute all or some of her vehicular overruns with vehicular bull rush maneuvers until the end of the vehicle&rsquo;s movement that turn. A vehicular bull rush pushes a creature or a vehicle away without doing harm. If the driver does not have the Improved Bull Rush feat or a similar ability, initiating a vehicular bull rush provokes an attack of opportunity from the creature being bull rushed with the vehicle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the bull rush is successful, the target of the bull rush is pushed 5 feet away from the vehicle. If you succeed at the check for the vehicular bull rush by 5 or more, you can deal the vehicle&rsquo;s ramming damage to the creature. For every 5 by which your attack exceeds your opponent&rsquo;s CMD, you push the target an additional 5 feet away. A creature being moved by a vehicular bull rush does not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the driver possesses the Greater Bull Rush feat. You cannot bull rush a creature or vehicle into a square that is occupied by an object (including a vehicle). If there is another creature in the way of a bull rush, the driver must immediately make a combat maneuver check to bull rush that creature, taking a &ndash;4 penalty on this check for each creature being pushed beyond the first. If successful, the driver can continue to push the creature or vehicle a distance equal to the lesser result.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ramming</h2>\n<p>Any time any part of a vehicle (including any creatures used as propulsion) enters the space of a creature or vehicle of its size or larger, or the space of a solid sturdy object (like a wall or a building) no matter the size of that object, it makes a ramming maneuver against that creature or object. There is no maneuver check for a ramming maneuver; its effects happen automatically. When a vehicle makes a ramming maneuver against a creature or an object, the vehicle deals its ramming damage to the creature or object, and the vehicle takes half that damage. The base amount of damage that a ramming vehicle does and takes is determined by its size (see Table 4&ndash;3).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When a vehicle makes a ramming maneuver against a solid object, to determine how much damage both the solid object and the vehicle take, allow the vehicle to enter the solid object&rsquo;s space. The vehicle will only travel through that space if the damage is enough to destroy the solid object; in all other cases the vehicle takes the damage and then comes to a sudden stop directly in front of the solid object.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When a vehicle makes a ramming maneuver against a creature, a nonsolid object, or another vehicle, it can enter the space of the object or the creature, and even end its move within that space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A vehicle can have a ram or similar ramming device on its forward facing. If it does, it ignores the damage for the first square it enters of a solid object, and all squares for other objects and creatures. A ram can be added to a Large vehicle for 50 gp, a Huge vehicle for 100 gp, a Gargantuan vehicle for 200 gp, and a Colossal vehicle for 400 gp. A vehicle cannot have a ram if it uses muscle propulsion (pulled).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a vehicle is being pulled by a creature or creatures when the vehicle takes damage due to a ramming maneuver, the creatures that are pulling it are damaged as well, and are knocked prone. A successful Reflex saving throw (DC 10 + 1 for every 10 feet of the speed the vehicle was moving when it hit the vehicle, structure, or creature) halves the damage and the creatures pulling it are not knocked prone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the vehicle making the ramming maneuver is a muscle-propelled (pulled) vehicle, the creatures pulling the vehicle attempt to avoid making a ramming maneuver. If a ramming maneuver is imminent, those creatures decelerate at a rate of up to twice their acceleration as an immediate action or attempt to swerve out of the way (automatically moving diagonally to avoid the vehicle or structure even if they were not driven to do so), avoiding the vehicle or structure if possible. The driver chooses which of these options occurs. A skilled driver can attempt to force the creature to continue the ramming maneuver, but doing so requires a DC 30 Handle Animal, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check, depending on the type and intelligence of the creature. The driver makes this check as an immediate action when the creature tries to decelerate or swerve out of the way.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 4-3: Ramming Damage by Size</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 39.5465%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 58.0181%;\" scope=\"col\">Vehicle Size</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.2334%;\" scope=\"col\">Damage</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 58.0181%;\">Large vehicle</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.2334%;\">1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 58.0181%;\">Huge vehicle</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.2334%;\">2d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 58.0181%;\">Gargantuan vehicle</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.2334%;\">4d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 58.0181%;\">Colossal vehicle</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.2334%;\">8d8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Damaging a Vehicle</h2>\n<p>Vehicles have hit points and hardness based on their primary components. Most vehicles are made of wood. Heavier construction materials are possible, but they at least double the number of squares of propulsion a vehicle requires. Materials like stone or heavy metals quadruple the number of squares of propulsion needed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A vehicle has a total number of hit points equal to its base material hit point value times its vehicle&rsquo;s number of squares (see Table 4&ndash;4). When it is reduced to below half hit points, it becomes broken. When it reaches 0 hit points, it becomes wrecked. When it reaches negative hit points equal to its number of squares, it is destroyed&mdash;it is so damaged it cannot even be used for scrap material.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 4&ndash;4: Vehicle Hit Points by Material</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 51.9797%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 58.4799%;\">Leather</td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.1754%;\">10</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.4464%;\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 58.4799%;\">Wood</td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.1754%;\">15</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.4464%;\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 58.4799%;\">Stone</td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.1754%;\">20</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.4464%;\">8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 58.4799%;\">Metal</td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.1754%;\">20</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.4464%;\">10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 58.4799%;\">Magically treated</td>\n<td style=\"width: 21.1754%;\">x2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 19.4464%;\">x2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Broken Condition</h2>\n<p>Vehicles, and sometimes their methods of propulsion, are objects, and like any other object, when they take damage in excess of half their hit points, they gain the broken condition. When a vehicle gains the broken condition, it takes a &ndash;2 penalty to AC, on saving throws, and on combat maneuver checks, and the DC to drive the vehicle increases by 2. If a vehicle or its means of propulsion becomes broken, both the maximum speed and the acceleration of the vehicle are halved until repaired. If the vehicle is in motion, and is traveling faster than its new maximum speed, it automatically decelerates to its new maximum speed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Wrecked Condition</h2>\n<p>A vehicle gains the wrecked condition if its hit points are reduced to 0 or fewer. A wrecked vehicle cannot be driven and gains the sinking condition (if in the water) or falls (if in the air). An air vehicle that begins to fall does so at a rate of half its maximum speed each round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a means of propulsion is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, it does not gain the wrecked condition. It is instead destroyed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sinking</h2>\n<p>A water vehicle that is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points or a vehicle that is not seaworthy that is plunged into water gains the sinking condition. For a water vehicle, this condition ends when a vehicle is brought to 1 or more hit points, but other vehicles must be removed from the water. A sinking ship fully sinks and is destroyed 10 rounds after gaining the sinking condition. Each additional hit on a sinking ship reduces the remaining time for it to sink by 1 round. Alternatively, when a water vehicle is reduced to a negative number of hit points equal to its number of squares, it sinks immediately.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Destroyed</h2>\n<p>A vehicle is destroyed when it is reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to its number of squares. A destroyed vehicle cannot be repaired, and is nothing more than junk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a vehicle&rsquo;s means of propulsion is an object, it is destroyed when it reaches 0 hit points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If either the means of propulsion or the vehicle is destroyed, it comes to a sudden stop if it is not stopped already. Water vehicles sink and drop to the bottom of the body of water. Air vehicles fall.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sudden Stops</h2>\n<p>When a vehicle comes to a sudden stop&mdash;its movement is reduced to 0 in some way other than the driver using a drive action to slow the vehicle&mdash;both creatures and items on the vehicle are violently pushed toward the vehicle&rsquo;s forward facing a number of squares equal to 1/2 the vehicle&rsquo;s current speed before it came to the sudden stop. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At the end of this movement, creatures and objects take 1d6 points of damage, and creatures must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex saving throw or be knocked prone. If the movement pushes creatures or objects into solid objects, that creature or object takes an additional 1d6 points of damage for each 5-foot square the push was reduced by the solid object.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For instance, if a vehicle with a movement of 60 feet makes a sudden stop due to hitting a brick wall, its driver is thrown 30 feet toward the brick wall. If the brick wall was only 5 feet away from the driver at the point of impact, the driver moves forward 5 feet, hits the wall, and takes 5d6 points of damage. She then takes the original 1d6 points of damage, after which she makes a Reflex saving throw to see if she falls prone for the sudden stop.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Repairing a Vehicle</h2>\n<p>The fastest and easiest way to repair a vehicle is with the mending and make whole spells, but more mundane methods can also be used. Craft (carpentry) can be used to repair most vehicles made of wood; because of their specialized construction, water vehicles require Craft (ships) to repair. Depending on the nature of the damage, such skills like Craft (cloth), Craft (alchemy), Knowledge (engineering), and even various professions can be used to repair vehicles, if the GM approves. In general, a day&rsquo;s worth of work by a single person using the appropriate skill to repair a vehicle requires 10 gp of raw material and a DC 10 skill check, and repairs 10 points of damage on a success, or 5 hit points on a failure.</p>"}

While avalanches of snow and ice are common, it&rsquo;s also possible to have an avalanche of rock and soil.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An avalanche can be spotted from as far away as 1d10 &times; 500 feet by a character who makes a DC 20 Perception check, treating the avalanche as a Colossal creature. If all characters fail their Perception checks to determine the encounter distance, the avalanche moves closer to them, and they automatically become aware of it when it closes to half the original distance. It&rsquo;s possible to hear an avalanche coming even if you can&rsquo;t see it. Under optimum conditions (no other loud noises occurring), a character who makes a DC 15 Perception check can hear the avalanche or landslide when it is 1d6 &times; 500 feet away. This check might have a DC of 20, 25, or higher in conditions where hearing is difficult (such as in the middle of a thunderstorm).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A landslide or avalanche consists of two distinct areas: the bury zone (in the direct path of the falling debris) and the slide zone (the area the debris spreads out to encompass). Characters in the bury zone always take damage from the avalanche; characters in the slide zone might be able to get out of the way. Characters in the bury zone take 8d6 points of damage, or half that amount if they make a DC 15 Reflex save. They are subsequently buried. Characters in the slide zone take 3d6 points of damage, or no damage if they make a DC 15 Reflex save.

If a buried character falls unconscious, he must make a DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute thereafter until freed or dead.

The bury zone in the center of the avalanche is half as wide as the avalanche&rsquo;s full width.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To determine the precise location of characters in the path of an avalanche, roll 1d6 &times; 20; the result is the number of feet from the center of the path taken by the bury zone to the center of the party&rsquo;s location.

Mounts that do not possess combat training (see the Handle Animal skill) are frightened by combat. If you don&rsquo;t dismount, you must make a DC 20 Ride check each round as a move action to control such a mount. If you succeed, you can perform a standard action after the move action. If you fail, the move action becomes a full-round action, and you can&rsquo;t do anything else until your next turn.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your mount acts on your initiative count as you direct it. You move at its speed, but the mount uses its action to move. A horse (not a pony) is a Large creature and thus takes up a space 10 feet (2 squares) across. For simplicity, assume that you share your mount&rsquo;s space during combat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Combat while Mounted</h2>\n<p>With a DC 5 Ride check, you can guide your mount with your knees so as to use both hands to attack or defend yourself. This is a free action.</p>\n<p>When you attack a creature smaller than your mount that is on foot, you get the +1 bonus on melee attacks for being on higher ground. If your mount moves more than 5 feet, you can only make a single melee attack. Essentially, you have to wait until the mount gets to your enemy before attacking, so you can&rsquo;t make a full attack. Even at your mount&rsquo;s full speed, you don&rsquo;t take any penalty on melee attacks while mounted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your mount charges, you also take the AC penalty associated with a charge. If you make an attack at the end of the charge, you receive the bonus gained from the charge. When charging on horseback, you deal double damage with a lance (see Charge).</p>\n<p>You can use ranged weapons while your mount is taking a double move, but at a &ndash;4 penalty on the attack roll. You can use ranged weapons while your mount is running (quadruple speed) at a &ndash;8 penalty. In either case, you make the attack roll when your mount has completed half its movement. You can make a full attack with a ranged weapon while your mount is moving. Likewise, you can take move actions normally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Casting Spells While Mounted</h2>\n<p>You can cast a spell normally if your mount moves up to a normal move (its speed) either before or after you cast. If you have your mount move both before and after you cast a spell, then you&rsquo;re casting the spell while the mount is moving, and you have to make a concentration check due to the vigorous motion (DC 10 + spell level) or lose the spell. If the mount is running (quadruple speed), you can cast a spell when your mount has moved up to twice its speed, but your concentration check is more difficult due to the violent motion (DC 15 + spell level).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>If Your Mount Falls in Battle</h2>\n<p>If your mount falls, you have to succeed on a DC 15 Ride check to make a soft fall and take no damage. If the check fails, you take 1d6 points of damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>If You Are Dropped</h2>\n<p>If you are knocked unconscious, you have a 50% chance to stay in the saddle (75% if you&rsquo;re in a military saddle). Otherwise you fall and take 1d6 points of damage. Without you to guide it, your mount avoids combat.</p>"}

Some characters are born under extraordinary circumstances, heralded by prophecy and omen; others live completely ordinary lives until some dramatic event casts them onto the dangerous roads traveled by heroes and monsters.</p>\n<p>A character&rsquo;s background forms the basis for complex motivations and emotional vulnerabilities, and these past experiences guide the way the character responds to circumstances in his or her present life. As the child of a goddess and a mortal, do you view ordinary creatures as inferior beings? Having grown up in abject poverty, how do you react when someone steals from you? If a militant theocracy burned your siblings as heretics, how do you respond to clerics of other religions?</p>\n<p>When playing a new character, the details in your background give you a quick handle on your past, making it easier to slip into the character&rsquo;s skin and embrace this mind-set in play. As the campaign proceeds, your early adventures gradually become part of that background&mdash;a seamless chain of events that make up your life and contribute to your constantly changing and evolving persona.</p>\n<h2>How to Create a Background</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Campaign pg. 8</em></p>\n<p>There are several ways you can approach character background using Ultimate Campaign. One approach is an organic method&mdash;brainstorming character details, guided by the questions in the following sections of this chapter. Alternatively, you might use the background generator, to compile your history randomly. You can also use the charts and tables in the background generator as a springboard for your imagination, deliberately selecting background elements that inspire you or fit the direction you wish to explore.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For published Pathfinder Adventure Paths, you often have the option of selecting campaign traits that tie your character thematically into a specific storyline relevant to that Adventure Path. Check with your GM to see if she can point you to official campaign traits or other traits that may help link your character to the campaign or adventure she&rsquo;s running. Such traits provide a good foundation upon which you can add details from this book, either by rolling randomly or by manually selecting background details that mesh well with your campaign&rsquo;s themes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No matter how you go about developing your character&rsquo;s background, the next step is to quantify that background in terms of game mechanics. Select two traits (or three traits and a drawback) that capture the background you imagined. Traits and drawbacks are listed here. These traits provide small bonuses that reflect skills and knowledge gained from your life experiences. The drawback, if you choose to take one, represents an emotional vulnerability or character flaw that should not only provide a slight mechanical disadvantage, but also (more importantly) serve as a roleplaying tool for making interesting choices. After all, nobody&rsquo;s perfect!</p>\n<h2>Using this Section</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Campaign pg. 9</em></p>\n<p>The rest of this section dives deep into your background, starting from birth and early childhood through adolescence and into early adulthood. Each bit has a number of questions to think (or write) about. As you go through them, you might find a question doesn&rsquo;t apply you. That&rsquo;s an opportunity to instead think about why it doesn&rsquo;t apply, and what that means about your relationship to the rest of the world. Likewise, if you find you have a short answer to a question, especially &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s an opportunity to dig deeper into why that&rsquo;s the case.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Above all, don&rsquo;t let creating a background become a burden for you. The goal is to help you play a character, not to paralyze you with decisions you don&rsquo;t want to make right now.</p>\n<h2>Early Life</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Campaign pg. 9</em></p>\n<p>Experiences in childhood have a monumental impact on the person you become later in life. Family, social class, region, family trade or profession, religion, culture, and major events that occur during your life have a formative influence on your character development and the worldview that you adopt as an adult.</p>\n<p>As you think about your early life, consider the following questions and imagine your roots in a time long before you gained the knack for the character class you have chosen&mdash;after all, almost nobody starts life with their future profession already laid out for them. This information will influence your choice of skills, traits, story feats, and penalties, and help to ground you in the campaign world.</p>\n<h2>Adolescence</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Campaign pg. 12</em></p>\n<p>Adolescence is the physical and psychological transition from childhood to adulthood in which you start to become more conscious of the world around you. This is the time when you grow in body and mind, take greater risks, question the rules and structures under which you&rsquo;ve lived, and test the boundaries and authorities that put those structures in place. It&rsquo;s also when many key events happen that influence you toward the path of the character class you will one day adopt.</p>\n<p>Now that you know something of your childhood circumstances, imagine the kinds of risks and choices you might have taken upon entering adolescence. Conversely, imagine the kinds of risks and choices you would avoid because of ethics, family, customs, tradition, religion, pride, or fear. As you read through the following categories, consider the questions and take some time to visualize the experiences you encountered during this turbulent time.</p>\n<h2>Adulthood</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Campaign pg. 13</em></p>\n<p>When you reach biological maturity, undergo the final initiation rites of adolescence, or reach the age of legal responsibility in your culture, you&rsquo;re considered an adult. At this point, you&rsquo;re the sum of all the feelings, experiences, and choices you have made from birth through adolescence. You are capable of analyzing your past, and your emotional and intellectual response to your experiences shapes your moral and ethical view of the world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In adulthood, you likely adopt your character class&mdash; although some people might assume full careers in the military, academia, the seminary, or a trade years before they begin adventuring, just as others pass through adolescence swiftly and reach maturity at an extremely young age. Playing an older or younger character can vary the party dynamic, and may warrant one extra or one fewer trait during character creation in order to reflect the character&rsquo;s greater or narrower life experience, at the GM&rsquo;s discretion. (See Young Characters) No matter your age, the experiences of your earlier life are a prologue to the character class you&rsquo;ve chosen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The following categories explore character conflicts and vulnerability that shape your worldview, philosophy, and alignment&mdash;the results of your journey to adulthood. As you read through this section, consider the amount of life experience you have upon entering the campaign.</p>\n<h2>Two Quirks and a Flaw: Quick and Dirty Character Establishement</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Campaign pg. 15</em></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re pressed for time or you&rsquo;re looking to create the basics of a character as simply as possible, establish the essence of your personality by thinking of two quirks and a flaw. Quirks are specific attributes of your personality or psyche: character traits, compulsions, eccentricities, or uncommon physical features.</p>\n<p>These shouldn&rsquo;t be commonplace or mundane. &ldquo;Tall&rdquo; is a poor one, but &ldquo;too big for my body&rdquo; could be great. &ldquo;Charismatic&rdquo; is weak, but &ldquo;flirts with nearly everybody I meet&rdquo; is specific and actionable. &ldquo;Homebody&rdquo; is not as good a quirk as &ldquo;feels tired, uncomfortable, and hungry away from home.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Add a flaw the same way. Instead of merely being &ldquo;arrogant,&rdquo; maybe you &ldquo;believe I&rsquo;m smarter than anyone I know.&rdquo; Perhaps you&rsquo;re not so much &ldquo;proud&rdquo; as &ldquo;afraid of being wrong and looking stupid.&rdquo; Rather than &ldquo;greedy,&rdquo; you may be &ldquo;terrified of dying poor and hungry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you choose an attribute or trait to use as a quirk or flaw, you can dig deeper into the concept by asking yourself how and why. If you&rsquo;re shy, how shy are you? So shy that you can never look anyone directly in the eye? If you&rsquo;re paranoid, why are you paranoid? Maybe everyone you&rsquo;ve ever trusted betrayed you? Homing in on desires and fears will help answer those questions. For the sake of brevity, the background generator uses basic descriptors for quirks and flaws.</p>\n<p>Take a little time to further build on those bare-bones descriptors with these sort of details, which will help color in an otherwise simple, nondescript character.</p>"}

Combining Magic Effects}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 208</em></p>\n<p>Many special spell effects are handled according to the school of the spells in question. Certain other special spell features are found across spell schools.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Attacks</h2>\n<p>Some spell descriptions refer to attacking. All offensive combat actions, even those that don&rsquo;t damage opponents, are considered attacks. Attempts to channel energy count as attacks if it would harm any creatures in the area. All spells that opponents resist with saving throws, that deal damage, or that otherwise harm or hamper subjects are attacks. Spells that summon monsters or other allies are not attacks because the spells themselves don&rsquo;t harm anyone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bonus Types</h2>\n<p>Usually, a bonus has a type that indicates how the spell grants the bonus. The important aspect of bonus types is that two bonuses of the same type don&rsquo;t generally stack. With the exception of dodge bonuses, most circumstance bonuses, and racial bonuses, only the better bonus of a given type works (see Combining Magical Effects). The same principle applies to penalties&mdash;a character taking two or more penalties of the same type applies only the worst one, although most penalties have no type and thus always stack. Bonuses without a type always stack, unless they are from the same source.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bringing Back the Dead</h2>\n<p>Several spells have the power to restore slain characters to life.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When a living creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature&rsquo;s deity resides. If the creature did not worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. Bringing someone back from the dead involves magically retrieving his soul and returning it to his body. For more information on the planes, see Chapter 13.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Negative Levels</h2>\n<p>Any creature brought back to life usually gains one or more permanent negative levels (see Appendix 1). These levels apply a penalty to most rolls until removed through spells such as restoration. If the character was 1st level at the time of death, he loses 2 points of Constitution instead of gaining a negative level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Preventing Revivification</h2>\n<p>Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from the dead. Keeping the body prevents others from using raise dead or resurrection to restore the slain character to life. Casting trap the soul prevents any sort of revivification unless the soul is first released.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Revivification against One&rsquo;s Will</h2>\n<p>A soul can&rsquo;t be returned to life if it doesn&rsquo;t wish to be. A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and may refuse to return on that basis.</p>"}

Creatures that take lethal damage from a fall land in a prone position.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a character deliberately jumps instead of merely slipping or falling, the damage is the same but the first 1d6 is nonlethal damage. A DC 15 Acrobatics check allows the character to avoid any damage from the first 10 feet fallen and converts any damage from the second 10 feet to nonlethal damage. Thus, a character who slips from a ledge 30 feet up takes 3d6 damage. If the same character deliberately jumps, he takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and 2d6 points of lethal damage. And if the character leaps down with a successful Acrobatics check, he takes only 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and 1d6 points of lethal damage from the plunge.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Falls onto yielding surfaces (soft ground, mud) also convert the first 1d6 of damage to nonlethal damage. This reduction is cumulative with reduced damage due to deliberate jumps and the Acrobatics skill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A character cannot cast a spell while falling, unless the fall is greater than 500 feet or the spell is an immediate action, such as feather fall. Casting a spell while falling requires a concentration check with a DC equal to 20 + the spell&rsquo;s level. Casting teleport or a similar spell while falling does not end your momentum, it just changes your location, meaning that you still take falling damage, even if you arrive atop a solid surface.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Falling into Water</h2>\n<p>Falls into water are handled somewhat differently. If the water is at least 10 feet deep, the first 20 feet of falling do no damage. The next 20 feet do nonlethal damage (1d3 per 10-foot increment). Beyond that, falling damage is lethal damage (1d6 per additional 10-foot increment).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Characters who deliberately dive into water take no damage on a successful DC 15 Swim check or DC 15 Acrobatics check, so long as the water is at least 10 feet deep for every 30 feet fallen. The DC of the check, however, increases by 5 for every 50 feet of the dive.</p>"}

They believe in transformation from within, whether through wholesale, systematic change of governance or personal epiphany.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All archons are immune to electricity and petrification attacks, and all have DR 10/evil. The magic circle used to summon them is made of powdered silver.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hound (SR 15)</h2>\n<p>Disciplined soldiers and vigilant sentinels, hound archons are valiant defenders of all that is good and holy. They value movement and swift yet thoughtful action, and delight in crushing evil; therefore, the best sacrifices when summoning a hound archon are magical shields imbued with holy power, ensorcelled rings or boots that grant swift or unfettered movement, or weaponry of great power.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Lantern</h2>\n<p>The least of the archons, lantern archons are friendly, and their greatest ambition is to see the cause of good advanced. To gain their favor, one should engage in a week&rsquo;s worth of charity or make a sincere offering worth 100 gp to a good cause in the name of Heaven.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shield (SR 21)</h2>\n<p>Solid, stoic, and often defensive even in personality, shield archons are highly skeptical of those who attempt to bind them, but if they can work in the defense of the common good or opposed to the machinations of fiends, they commonly ask their binder to care for and protect a shrine or temple as a gift for their service.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Star (SR 30)</h2>\n<p>Brilliant, wise, and constantly strategizing the protection of Heaven or the defeat of the forces of evil, star archons often chafe under the bindings of mortal spellcasters. Negotiations often devolve into the star archon blasting his binder for shortsightedness and wasting the archon&rsquo;s time. Star archons demand outrageous gifts even when the cause is just. Only when the archon&rsquo;s and the binder&rsquo;s goals work in close concert are the gifts the archon demands nearly attainable.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Trumpet (SR 25)</h2>\n<p>Mighty warriors and messengers, trumpet archons are the leaders of Heaven&rsquo;s strike forces and the heralds of gods. To gain their favor, one must prove worthy of their presence; rather than making offerings of things, trumpet archons ask for sacrifices of service and time, and any binder who offers an exchange of services&mdash;and intends to keep her word&mdash;gains a +2 Charisma bonus. Those who renege on their bonds see their fortunes begin to vanish, and take a &ndash;2 Charisma penalty when dealings with good extraplanar creatures until they set matters right.</p>"}

An initiative check is a Dexterity check. Each character applies his or her Dexterity modifier to the roll, as well as other modifiers from feats, spells, and other effects. Characters act in order, counting down from the highest result to the lowest. In every round that follows, the characters act in the same order (unless a character takes an action that results in his or her initiative changing; see @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.K9b3WAUD63Up5YM2]{2.08. Special Initiative Actions}).</p>\n<p>If two or more combatants have the same initiative check result, the combatants who are tied act in order of total initiative modifier (highest first). If there is still a tie, the tied characters should roll to determine which one of them goes before the other.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Flat-Footed</h2>\n<p>At the start of a battle, before you have had a chance to act (specifically, before your first regular turn in the initiative order), you are flat-footed. You can&rsquo;t use your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) while flat-footed. Barbarians and rogues of high enough level have the uncanny dodge extraordinary ability, which means that they cannot be caught flat-footed. Characters with uncanny dodge retain their Dexterity bonus to their AC and can make attacks of opportunity before they have acted in the first round of combat. A flat-footed character can&rsquo;t make attacks of opportunity, unless he has the @Compendium[pf-content.pf-feats.Rc5rGOpYGM2jHKjS]{Combat Reflexes} feat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Inaction</h2>\n<p>Even if you can&rsquo;t take actions, you retain your initiative score for the duration of the encounter.</p>"}

One dragon produces enough hide to make a single suit of masterwork hide armor for a creature one size category smaller than the dragon. By selecting only choice scales and bits of hide, an armorsmith can produce one suit of masterwork banded mail for a creature two sizes smaller, one suit of masterwork half-plate for a creature three sizes smaller, or one masterwork breastplate or suit of full plate for a creature four sizes smaller. In each case, enough hide is available to produce a light or heavy masterwork shield in addition to the armor, provided that the dragon is Large or larger. If the dragonhide comes from a dragon that had immunity to an energy type, the armor is also immune to that energy type, although this does not confer any protection to the wearer. If the armor or shield is later given the ability to protect the wearer against that energy type, the cost to add such protection is reduced by 25%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because dragonhide armor isn&rsquo;t made of metal, druids can wear it without penalty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dragonhide armor costs twice as much as masterwork armor of that type, but it takes no longer to make than ordinary armor of that type (double all Craft results).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dragonhide has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 10.

Shadow Plane}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 440</em></p>\n<p>A silvery void that connects the Material and Inner Planes to the Outer Planes, the astral plane is the medium through which the souls of the departed travel to the afterlife. A traveler in the Astral Plane sees the plane as a vast empty void periodically dotted with tiny motes of physical reality calved off of the countless planes it overlaps. Powerful spellcasters utilize the Astral Plane for a tiny fraction of a second when they teleport, or they can use it to travel between planes with spells like astral projection.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>GameMastery Guide pg. 191</em></p>\n<p>The Astral Plane is the space between the Inner and Outer Planes, and coterminous with all of the planes. When a character moves through a portal or projects her spirit to a different plane of existence, she travels through the Astral Plane. Even spells that allow instantaneous movement across a plane brief ly touch the Astral Plane. The Astral Plane is a great, endless expanse of clear silvery sky, both above and below. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Planar Traits</h2>\n<p>The Astral Plane has the following traits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Subjective Directional Gravity</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Timeless</strong>: Age, hunger, thirst, aff lictions (such as diseases, curses, and poisons), and natural healing don&rsquo;t function in the Astral Plane, though they resume functioning when the traveler leaves the Astral Plane.</li>\n<li><strong>Mildly Neutral-Aligned</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Magic</strong>: All spells and spell-like abilities used within the Astral Plane may be employed as if they were improved by the Quicken Spell or Quicken Spell-Like Ability feats. Already quickened spells and spell-like abilities are unaffected, as are spells from magic items. Spells so quickened are still prepared and cast at their unmodified level. As with the Quicken Spell feat, only one quickened spell or spell-like ability can be cast per round.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Occult Adventures pg. 243</em></p>\n<p>The Astral Plane is the great silvery sky that connects all planes to one another, the realm of pure thought and expanded consciousness. Occasional islands of solid matter float in astral space, but most of the plane is an enormous, seemingly eternal void of silver radiance. As a gateway between the Inner and Outer Spheres, the Astral Plane teems with travelers, from entities venturing between planes to explorers searching for one of the numerous demiplanes secreted here or looking for the one of the countless marooned spirits that dwell within the expanse. Its nature as a crossroads makes the Astral Plane very dangerous. Although it&rsquo;s possible to visit the plane bodily via plane shift or by using an item such as a robe of stars, most travelers prefer to play it safe by manifesting their souls in an astral body created by spells such as astral projection.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A creature&rsquo;s astral body looks like a translucent version of its physical form, usually limned with a soft nimbus of blue or violet light. A slim tether of resilient incorporeal energy known as a silver cord connects a creature&rsquo;s astral body to its unconscious physical body. If the astral body dies, the silver cord retracts into the physical body, returning the soul to its familiar seat (albeit at the cost of two permanent negative levels due to the resultant trauma). A silver cord resists most attempts to damage it, but if it somehow manages to break, the creature immediately dies, and the astral form housing its soul is cast adrift on the astral currents, pulled inexorably toward the enormous spire of the Boneyard, which extends up into the Astral Plane from the surface of the Outer Sphere. As a realm of thought, the Astral Plane is home to entities that represent concepts, myths, and legends spawned from mortal thoughtforms. Mediums open their consciousness to these denizens of the Astral Plane, inviting them to reside in a physical form and spread their influence on the Material Plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Travel through the Astral Plane is a strange affair, as the plane&rsquo;s subjective directional gravity means that each traveler chooses the direction of gravity&rsquo;s pull. Creatures can move normally in any direction by imagining &ldquo;down&rdquo; near their feet and &ldquo;falling&rdquo; in that direction. In this way a creature &ldquo;falls&rdquo; 150 feet the first round and 300 feet on each successive round. Movement is straight-line only. A character can attempt a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of gravity or stop as a free action; this check can be attempted once per round. Any character who fails this Wisdom check on successive rounds receives a +6 bonus on subsequent checks until he succeeds. When moving in this manner, the traveler does not have the sensation of physical movement. Rather, the landscape of the Astral Plane (such as it is) seems to come toward, through, and past him. Scintillations of light are thrown off by the astral body as it moves along at great speed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The untethered astral bodies of the dead flow toward the Boneyard along the River of Souls. During this process, the dross of mortality is shed, leaving behind only the soul&rsquo;s core self, its memories, and the refined character of its prior life. The gods of the Outer Sphere consider the River of Souls inviolate, often sending celestial and infernal outsiders to help steward wayward souls toward judgment and eventual delivery to their afterlife of reward or punishment. Soul-collecting or soul-devouring predators such as night hags and astradaemons prey on the dead of the Astral Plane, usually limiting themselves to picking off isolated incorporeal undead but all too often raiding parties of disembodied souls as they make their way toward eternity. Pharasma, the goddess of the dead, hates this perversion of the natural order of the multiverse, and the entities known as psychopomps often act as guides to deliver souls safely to their final destinations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other inhabitants of the Astral Plane include enormous astral leviathans that float through the silvery seas, sometimes with passengers or even semi-permanent settlements upon their backs; strange caulborn who harvest knowledge and psychic energy from astral travelers; formless nirmanakaya manasaputras who seek to guide Material Plane adepts through telepathy; and the lean humanoid outsiders known as the shulsaga, multiplanar hunters who ride magical disks and view intruders to their astral realm with xenophobic disdain.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Denizens</h1>\n<p>For most, the Astral Plane is merely a Transitive Planes&mdash;a means of reaching more desirable destinations, be it via teleportation or traveling through the Silver Sea. However, those who call this realm home live and die here, all the while contesting with the plane&rsquo;s timeless quality; while these species never hunger or age, neither do they heal naturally or truly grow in ways familiar to those from other realms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Aeons</h2>\n<p>The multiverse may sustain itself through the cycle of souls, yet there are so many moving parts that could fall out of alignment that the system as a whole requires constant maintenance. The inscrutable aeons serve this role; the Astral Plane is not only their highway for reaching the far corners of the cosmos, but also where they originate. Just as astral material can aggregate to form demiplanes, so too do stray thoughts broadcast from other planes sometimes coalesce on this plane. As diametrically opposite ideas grind against one another, they form energized drifts that flash with momentary bursts of emotional auras and crackle in metaphysical debates. Referred to as aeonic nebulae, these colorful fields eventually reach a critical mass, whereupon the clashing concepts&rsquo; eddies take permanent form as new aeons, each often embodying the same dichotomy as the nebula from which it was born. From there, most aeons disperse to wherever they&rsquo;re needed in the multiverse; the Astral Plane&rsquo;s relatively high concentration of aeons is due almost exclusively to their creation here and to their use of the realm for transportation. The only aeons who are otherwise regularly found on the plane are bythos, guardians of time and planar travel. These cloud-like beings vigilantly patrol the Astral Plane, watching for those who would exploit the plane&rsquo;s timeless quality and connectivity to distort the flow of time elsewhere or to unite two realms best kept separate&mdash;at least according to their silent judgment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Astral Dragons</h2>\n<p>Much as mortal legends can imprint themselves on the Astral Plane as legendary spirits, so too did dragonkind brand itself upon this timeless sea. Astral dragons are descendants of several especially powerful draconic echoes that awoke within the Astral Plane and began acting autonomously. The astral dragons of today strive for excellence, much as their progenitors did, continuing to clash with one another to carry on conflicts both new and impossibly old. Astral dragons exist in a timeless realm and do not age in the same way true dragons do. Astral dragons&rsquo; contests, experiences, and inspirations refine each individual&rsquo;s psychic potential, granting it a greater presence on the Astral Plane and allowing it to grow gradually in size and power. Those astral dragons that travel to other planes can age several categories spontaneously as both the passage of time and accrued self-confidence trigger an explosive growth spurt in a matter of seconds&mdash;which is particularly troubling if a dragon suddenly becomes too large to fit back through the portal from which it came.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Astral Leviathans</h2>\n<p>The Astral Plane&rsquo;s greatest wanderers are astral leviathans, massive whalelike beings with asymmetrical eyes, a multitude of overlapping jaws, and warped, skinless muscles. Astral leviathans require little sustenance&mdash;even without the plane&rsquo;s timeless trait&mdash;but prioritize variety in their diet. This drives them to open rifts, where food particles or even hapless creatures might fall into the Silver Sea. Like elephants seeking water, astral leviathans have an unerring sense of where they&rsquo;ve been before and what they can find there&mdash;a quality that the nomadic shulsagas value when they befriend and recruit leviathans as traveling companions. The immense beasts in turn appreciate shulsagas&rsquo; companionship and ability to sense nearby planar breaches where the leviathans might sample some new cuisine or culture. Other species tend to be more forceful in their dealings with astral leviathans, trapping or enchanting them and rigging them with cargo harnesses to carry freight across the plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Danavas</h2>\n<p>Like most titans, danavas trace their origins to the earliest days of creation when they served as peacekeepers of reality. The same titan wars that saw their evil kin banished to the Outer Planes also resulted in danavas&rsquo; imprisonment, for their methods of policing the cosmos were deemed too severe. Although they are sealed across a variety of planes, most reside in perpetual captivity in a handful of cities that float through the Astral Plane. From there, they scry upon distant worlds, agonize over the ways in which mortals unbalance existence, and convene to discuss how best to restore cosmic order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Devourers</h2>\n<p>Those fiends and evil spellcasters who find a break in the Astral Plane and escape beyond the Outer Sphere sometimes return, twisted and transformed into devourers. Many of these undead linger on the Astral Plane, where they compete with night hags and astradaemons in plucking victims from the River of Souls. But other outsiders vigilantly guard the river, so devourers often wander to other realms or traverse the Astral Plane in search of easier prey.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Elohim</h2>\n<p>The powerful elohim are virtually silent about their own origins, yet they are the source of life on countless worlds. The prevailing hypothesis is that the gods crafted elohim as impartial servitors who would then create mortal forms to help populate reality&rsquo;s initial draft in the Fey World, only to cast elohim aside when the gods moved on with the Material Plane&rsquo;s creation. No matter their original purpose, elohim today predominantly inhabit the Astral Plane. There they build new demiplanes seeded with never-before-seen species and possibilities before departing to begin the process again elsewhere. For all their powers of creation, elohim seem incapable of reproducing, and most shulsagas believe that elohim created them as a form of proxy children. While many shulsagas have since spurned their creators, others believe that by attaining a truly enlightened state, a shulsaga can transcend its simple form and metamorphose into a new elohim. Enduring shulsaga tales of their paragons support this idea; however, elohim&rsquo;s dwindling numbers suggest otherwise&mdash;that elohim are on the path to extinction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ouroboroses</h2>\n<p>The cycles of divine creation and destruction that created the multiverse echo eternally through the Astral Plane, slowed by neither time nor matter. This never-ending process has coagulated into serpentine beasts known as ouroboroses, forever left to consume themselves and be reborn in an unending loop.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Psychementals</h2>\n<p>Just as souls can cross planar boundaries, so too can powerful thoughts echo outward like ripples in the astral sea. Particularly exuberant, passionate, or traumatic thoughts can gather quintessence as they travel, gradually developing sentience as they collide with other ideas and memories. From these clashes develop psychementals, intellects formed from hundreds of consciences that lack the context they knew in life. These fragmented personalities can war with one another for centuries before coming to an uneasy consensus, and although the collective can behave as a unified whole, surprises can shock the entire system into a fury of unpredictable internal squabbling and even violence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shining Children</h2>\n<p>The accretion of metaphysical material not only begets demiplanes, but also emits intense pulses of light and energy. Quintessence adheres to the brightest of these sparks, creating life in a painful process that forever imprints itself on the anthropomorphic creature that results: a shining child. Born out of cosmic trauma, these beings seethe with spite, and their telepathic communications echo with the furious roar of their birth. Every demiplane leaves a different imprint on its &ldquo;offspring,&rdquo; who seem capable of identifying others of their own cohort by some sixth sense. Not every demiplane spawns shining children, but the greatest demiplanes can create cohorts that are scores strong. Forever trapped in apparently adolescent bodies, these children dedicate themselves to scholarship in a futile effort to understand their role in the multiverse and the burning injustice of their births.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Shulsagas</h2>\n<p>Although the spindly shulsagas are among the more anthropomorphically relatable species native to the Astral Plane, they rarely welcome visitors. Their isolationist preferences aren&rsquo;t just for their own peace, but more importantly for the sake of their charges: the nascent demiplanes that they guard. Just as formative demiplanes can absorb the influences of nearby Outer Planes, so too can stray moral influences, power-hungry manipulators, and other forms of meddling (accidental or otherwise) contaminate a new world.</p>\n<p>Casual travelers often describe shulsagas as hunters, though as outsiders on a timeless plane, these creatures have virtually no need for conventional sustenance. Instead, their tracking, territorial behavior, and ability to sense planar rifts ensure that their adopted nurseries remain sacrosanct. Shulsaga tribes act as planar shepherds, departing each demiplane in their care once they&rsquo;re certain it has coalesced completely and isn&rsquo;t at immediate risk from stray philosophies.</p>\n<p>Shulsagas take it upon themselves to practice moral moderation so that they do not corrupt their charges themselves. Those who demonstrate discernible alignment extremes are often cast out to fend for themselves, ideally using their travels to rediscover a neutral outlook and return to the tribe. Rarely, shulsagas decide to cultivate a particular planar trait or ethical foundation for a demiplane, and when they do, their envoys travel far across the Astral Plane in search of strong-willed individuals (often adventurers) who become honored guests of the tribe and serve as mental templates to shape a new realm. Likewise, shulsagas sometimes reach out to strangers to help them fend off a confirmed threat, whether that means destroying shining children spawned by a demiplane or discouraging an errant elohim&rsquo;s unsolicited attempt to populate a demiplane.</p>\n<p>The only creatures that shulsagas implicitly trust are aeons, whom they view as divine messengers. When an aeon expresses its desire to impose change on something in the shulsagas&rsquo; territory, shulsagas typically stand aside or even shift their priorities to aid the aeon&mdash;even if that seems to reverse the tribe&rsquo;s previously held beliefs. It is this mutability that can cause a previously friendly tribe of suddenly seem xenophobic or hostile.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Divinities</h2>\n<p>Although the Astral Plane is often traveled by divinities (particularly demigods in astral form) or used as a neutral meeting ground.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Exploration</h2>\n<p>The Astral Plane is a disorienting realm with directional subjective gravity, allowing each creature to &ldquo;fall&rdquo; at great speed in the direction of its choice.</p>\n<p>No day-night cycle exists on the Astral Plane. The light of the Plane of Fire surrounding the Inner Sphere, along with the flow of souls from life to death (or the flow of recycled quintessence back to the Positive Energy Plane) can aid in navigation if these energies can be detected, but no truly workable analog to north exists on the Astral Plane.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Magic on the Astral Plane</h2>\n<p>All spells and spell-like abilities used within the Astral Plane can be employed as if they were improved by the Quicken Spell or Quicken Spell-Like Ability feats, though this has no effect on spells and abilities that have already been quickened or on spells from magic items. Spells thus quickened are prepared and cast at their unmodified level. As with the Quicken Spell feat, only one quickened spell or ability can be cast per round.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Silver Squalls (CR 10) </strong></h3>\n<p>Weather is virtually nonexistent on the Astral Plane, but drifts of aggregating thoughts can turn violent when sparked by competing ideas. These trigger chain reactions known as silver squalls, which erupt into clouds of obfuscating chatter punctuated by arcing bolts of psychic energy. A silver squall&rsquo;s effects target all creatures in the area and vary by the debate the squall represents, dealing 2d6 points of ability damage to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (depending on the nature of the debate), causing the confused condition for 1d10 rounds, or striking victims permanently blind, deaf, or mute. A silver squall generally fills a 300-foot-diameter sphere and lasts for 2d6 rounds. Each round a creature is exposed to a silver squall, it must succeed at a DC 20 Will save to resist the squall&rsquo;s effect; once a creature has been affected by a particular squall, it cannot be affected by that same squall again.</p>\n<p>Sentient beings caught within a squall can calm the storm as a full-round action by discerning its constituent ideas (typically with a successful DC 30 Knowledge [planes] check) to dismantle the controversy. Larger squalls exist that can last for days; quelling these storms can require complex arguments better represented by the verbal duels system. Silver squalls are mind-affecting effects.</p>"}

Driving Devices}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 173</em></p>\n<p>Controlling a vehicle takes common sense, awareness, intuition, and often some amount of skill in its method of propulsion. In the case of muscle propulsion, it is about guiding the creatures to move the vehicle. In the case of current propulsion, it is about using the current and tools like sails, oars, or a rudder to move the vehicle. With magic, it is typically about understanding the magic device that powers the propulsion and using the device properly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Driving Actions</h2>\n<p>A driver can, at the start of her turn, before taking any other action, take any of the following actions (except the &ldquo;uncontrolled&rdquo; action) to control a vehicle. If the driver does not take an action, takes another action, or delays or readies an action, she loses control of the vehicle and the vehicle takes the &ldquo;uncontrolled&rdquo; action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Accelerate (standard action)</strong></h3>\n<p>With a successful driving check, the vehicle&rsquo;s current speed increases up to its acceleration (in 5-foot increments; minimum 5 feet), but no higher than its maximum speed. The vehicle can move forward or forward diagonally. In other words, each time a vehicle enters a new 5-foot square, it can choose any of its forward-facing squares&mdash;the ones directly in front or either of the squares directly forward and diagonal. This allows the vehicle to swerve. A driver who fails her driving check can only move into squares directly in front of the vehicle&rsquo;s forward facing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Decelerate (standard action)</strong></h3>\n<p>With a successful driving check, the vehicle&rsquo;s current speed decreases by a rate up to its acceleration (in 5-foot increments; minimum 5 feet). On a failed check, the vehicle does not decelerate. Either way, the vehicle can move forward diagonally. If deceleration reduces a vehicle&rsquo;s speed to 0, some amount of inertia will continue to move the vehicle forward. The vehicle moves forward (either directly forward or forward diagonally) 1d4 &times; 5 feet before coming to a complete stop. Having the Expert Driver feat (see page 100) reduces this distance by 10 feet (minimum 0 feet).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Keep It Going (move action)</strong></h3>\n<p>With a successful driving check, the driver can move the vehicle forward on its current facing at its current speed, and it can move forward diagonally. Failing the check keeps the speed constant, but you cannot move the vehicle forward diagonally.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Reverse (standard action)</strong></h3>\n<p>A vehicle may only be moved in reverse if it is at a full stop (movement of 0 feet). On a successful driving check, a vehicle can move backward at half its acceleration, moving either directly backward (the reverse of its forward facing) or backward diagonally. On a failed check, it does not move backward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Turn (standard action)</strong></h3>\n<p>The driver takes this action to turn a vehicle&rsquo;s forward facing 90 degrees. The vehicle moves its current speed. If a vehicle&rsquo;s current speed is twice its acceleration, the driving check DC increases by 5. If a vehicle&rsquo;s movement is three times its acceleration, the driving check DC increases by 10. If it is four or more times its acceleration, the DC increases by 20. With a successful driving check, the vehicle changes its facing either left or right by 90 degrees at any point during its movement. Do this by pivoting the vehicle so that the left rear or right rear side of the vehicle takes the place of the vehicle&rsquo;s former forward facing side. On a failed check, the vehicle does not turn, but can be moved forward diagonally during its movement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Uncontrolled (no action)</strong></h3>\n<p>When the driver does nothing or there is no driver, the vehicle is uncontrolled. An uncontrolled vehicle moves forward only (it cannot move forward diagonally). If a vehicle has muscle propulsion, it decelerates at a rate equal to its acceleration. If a vehicle is powered by an air current, water current, or some form of weird current, it slows by 10 feet. These decelerations are cumulative. If a vehicle does nothing, it cannot perform vehicular bull rushes, but can still perform a vehicular overrun or a ramming maneuver (see Vehicle Combat Maneuvers).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Driving a Vehicle Outside of Combat</h2>\n<p>Since driving a vehicle outside of combat is easily accomplished by taking 10 on the skill check, driving checks are not normally needed. Almost every character can do it with relative ease; the DCs are given only to adjudicate special situations that may come up in your game.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Driving a Vehicle with Magic Propulsion</h2>\n<p>Typically, a vehicle with magic propulsion requires actions but no driving checks in order to drive it. When driving a vehicle with magic propulsion, treat every action as though the driver succeeded at the driving check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Driving a Vehicle without the Proper Skill</h2>\n<p>If a driver lacks the proper skill to drive a vehicle, the driver can always make a Wisdom ability check instead of the appropriate skill check. The driver can even take 10 or gain the benefits of aid another when using Wisdom instead of the vehicle&rsquo;s normal driving skill.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Vehicle Crews</h2>\n<p>Some vehicles require a crew. A vehicle with a full crew complement is as easy to control as any other vehicle. A vehicle without a full crew complement, but with at least half its crew, increases all driving check DCs by 10. A vehicle needs at least half its crew complement in order to be driven at all. Crew members can take no action while the vehicle is in motion except to aid in that vehicle&rsquo;s movement. A crew member does not threaten an area.</p>"}

Most spells in the Core Rulebook have verbal and somatic components, and new spells should follow this trend.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The advantage of spells that don&rsquo;t require verbal components is they can be cast in an area of silence, and thus there is the temptation to create silent versions of common combat spells. However, doing so devalues the Silent Spell feat, just like making swift-action spells devalues Quicken Spell, though not to such a great extent (casting two spells per round is a more serious problem than having a backup spell to counteract an unexpected silence). If casters decide they&rsquo;d rather prepare a silent magic missile instead of acid arrow, or a silent acid arrow instead of fireball, they&rsquo;ve deliberately chosen weaker options, and that&rsquo;s fine.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The advantage of spells that don&rsquo;t require somatic components is they can be cast when bound, grappled, or when both hands are full or occupied, and arcane spell failure doesn&rsquo;t apply. Just as creating silent versions of spells devalues Silent Spell, making non-somatic spells devalues the Still Spell feat. The premise of the game is that most spells require words and gestures, and new spells should stick with that unless the theme of the spell suggests it wouldn&rsquo;t require a somatic component, or it was specifically designed to escape bindings or grapples.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The advantage of spells that don&rsquo;t require material components is they don&rsquo;t require a spell component pouch (and in the rare circumstance in which if you&rsquo;re grappled, you needn&rsquo;t already have your material components in hand to cast the spell). Most material components are part of a spell for flavor rather than to satisfy rules. The guano and sulfur material components of fireball are there because early gunpowder (black powder) was made from guano and sulfur. The fur and glass rod material components of lightning bolt come from the ability to create a buildup of static electricity by rubbing fur against a glass rod. The game could present those spells without material components at all, and it would have a negligible effect on how the game plays (as proven by the &ldquo;it has whatever I need&rdquo; spell component pouch, and the sorcerer class getting Eschew Materials as a bonus feat)&mdash;they&rsquo;re just in the spell for fun. Balance your spell assuming it has no material components or free material components, and then add them in if the flavor seems appropriate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Costly material components should be used to prevent overzealous players from casting the spell as often as they want, because the spell either makes adventuring too easy if everyone in the party has it (such as stoneskin), allows the PCs to bypass key adventuring experiences like exploring and investigating (such as augury, divination, and commune), or allows the PCs to trivialize certain threats (such as raise dead and restoration). Balance a spell without costly material components if possible, usually by raising the spell level if it is too good for the intended level. Sometimes the power level of a spell is on target (like augury, as it makes sense to have a low-level divination spell for clerics), but the spell is valuable enough that players will overuse it if it&rsquo;s free, so you have to apply a gp cost to moderate how often the PCs use it. Long-lasting defensive spells such as glyph of warding also fit into this category; if they were free, every spellcaster would cover her lair in them, casting one per day for the weeks or months of planning the NPC has before the PCs arrive. By giving glyph of warding a gp cost, it allows for more traditional adventuring&mdash;otherwise every square the PCs walk on is a potential trap, slowing play to a crawl as the PCs are forced to slowly and carefully search every square to notice the glyphs (given that a typical 5th-level rogue has +14 to Perception against a DC 28 glyph, meaning she fails most searches unless she takes 20).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Focus components are governed by the same rules as material components&mdash;in most cases they&rsquo;re just there for flavor, and are only relevant if costly. A costly focus is like a costly material component, except it&rsquo;s a one-time expenditure rather than a repeat expenditure, a barrier to entry that you can ignore once you&rsquo;ve crossed the threshold. A costly focus is a good way to delay when PCs gain access to the spell, but once they have the materials, it&rsquo;s essentially just like any other spell without a costly focus. As with material components, balance the spell for its level, and if it seems like the spell is too good and delaying access to it would help moderate it, consider adding a costly focus component.</p>"}

Magic Item Creation}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 496</em></p>\n<p>A wand is a thin baton that contains a single spell of 4th level or lower. A wand has 50 charges when created&mdash;each charge allows the use of the wand&rsquo;s spell one time. A wand that runs out of charges is just a stick. The price of a wand is equal to the level of the spell &times; the creator&rsquo;s caster level &times; 750 gp. If the wand has a material component cost, it is added to the base price and cost to create once for each charge (50 &times; material component cost). Table 15&ndash;17 gives sample prices for wands created at the lowest possible caster level for each spellcasting class. Note that some spells appear at different levels for different casters. The level of such spells depends on the caster crafting the wand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>A wand is 6 to 12 inches long, 1/4 inch thick, and weighs no more than 1 ounce. Most wands are wood, but some are bone, metal, or even crystal. A typical wand has AC 7, 5 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 16.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Activation</h2>\n<p>Wands use the spell trigger activation method, so casting a spell from a wand is usually a standard action that doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity. (If the spell being cast has a longer casting time than 1 action, however, it takes that long to cast the spell from a wand.) To activate a wand, a character must hold it in hand (or whatever passes for a hand, for nonhumanoid creatures) and point it in the general direction of the target or area. A wand may be used while grappling or while swallowed whole.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Special Qualities</h2>\n<p>Roll d%. A 01&ndash;30 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides some clue to the wand&rsquo;s function, and 31&ndash;100 indicates no special qualities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 15-17: Wands</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 67.617%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.5803%;\" scope=\"col\">Minor</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.806%;\" scope=\"col\">Medium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.2623%;\" scope=\"col\">Major</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 23.5294%;\" scope=\"col\">Spell Level</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 26.5501%;\" scope=\"col\">Caster Level</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.5803%;\">01-05</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.806%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.2623%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 23.5294%;\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 26.5501%;\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.5803%;\">06-60</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.806%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.2623%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 23.5294%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 26.5501%;\">1st</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.5803%;\">61-100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.806%;\">01-606</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.2623%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 23.5294%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 26.5501%;\">3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.5803%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.806%;\">61-100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.2623%;\">01-60</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 23.5294%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 26.5501%;\">5th</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.5803%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 17.806%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.2623%;\">61-100</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 23.5294%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 26.5501%;\">7th</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>@Compendium[pf1.ultimate-equipment.TeMae6GRt7G53JVJ]{Common Level 0 Wands} @Compendium[pf1.ultimate-equipment.VKYvNo9t1wQ3pCEk]{Uncommon Level 0 Wands}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf1.ultimate-equipment.Kxtzw02nxm5GWPb9]{Common Level 1 Wands} @Compendium[pf1.ultimate-equipment.2UQtiEKX67vy7gUT]{Uncommon Level 1 Wands}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf1.ultimate-equipment.qeC9fgOka2MItT2A]{Common Level 2 Wands} @Compendium[pf1.ultimate-equipment.visy19CsXY2jpABp]{Uncommon Level 2 Wands}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf1.ultimate-equipment.dB3WvGIjmNmuI0kP]{Common Level 3 Wands} @Compendium[pf1.ultimate-equipment.tQ3dzkGqsrzhzHKl]{Uncommon Level 3 Wands}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf1.ultimate-equipment.tZRMfjJerg5a9O5N]{Common Level 4 Wands} @Compendium[pf1.ultimate-equipment.AoVoLFKJpX4bPUqh]{Uncommon Level 4 Wands}</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Wand Costs</h2>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">Spell Level</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" scope=\"col\">Cleric, Druid, Wizard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" scope=\"col\">Sorcerer</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" scope=\"col\">Bard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" scope=\"col\">Paladin, Ranger</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">375 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">375 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">375 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">750 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">750 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">750 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">750 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">4,500 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">6,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">6,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">6,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">11,250 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">13,500 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">15,750 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">15,750 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">21,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">24,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">30,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">30,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

Centuries ago, a sahuagin nation from the Inner Sea mobilized a city-sized saltwater bolus for an overland assault on a merfolk state located near modern-day Korvosa. The merfolk learned of this ambitious plan and sent an elite group of soldiers in saltwater tanks to intercept the ocean-bubble. The two sides clashed in Lake Encarthan and eventually worked their way up into what is now the River Kingdoms. In this battle, many of the wizards maintaining the sahuagin&rsquo;s briny mobile fortress perished, and the two sides ended up stranded hundreds of miles from any ocean. Begrudgingly putting aside their grievances, the merfolk and sahuagin worked together to prevent their mutual extinction, holding back the fresh water with spells and building the settlement of Outsea to serve as a permanent home. Now Outsea is a thriving city, home to all kinds of peoples. Centuries of coexistence have worn down the merfolk and sahuagin&rsquo;s hatred for each other, and now they live and work together in peace.

Negative Energy Plane}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Two energy planes exist&mdash;the Positive Energy Plane (from which the animating spark of life hails) and the Negative Energy Plane (from which the sinister taint of undeath hails). Energy from both planes infuses reality, the ebb and flow of this energy running through all creatures to bear them along the journey from birth to death. Clerics utilize power from these planes when they channel energy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>GameMastery Guide pg. 188</em></p>\n<p>To an observer, there&rsquo;s little to see on the Negative Energy Plane. It is a dark, empty place, an eternal pit where a traveler can fall until the plane itself steals away all light and life. The Negative Energy Plane is the most hostile of the Inner Planes, the most uncaring and intolerant of life. Only creatures immune to its life-draining energies can survive there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Planar Traits</h2>\n<p>The Negative Energy Plane has the following traits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Subjective Directional Gravity</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Major Negative-Dominant</strong>: Some areas within the plane have only the minor negative-dominant trait, and these islands tend to be inhabited.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities that use negative energy are enhanced. Class abilities that use negative energy, such as channel negative energy, gain a +4 bonus to the save DC to resist the ability.</li>\n<li><strong>Impeded Magic</strong>: Spells and spell-like abilities that use positive energy (including cure spells) are impeded. Characters on this plane take a &ndash;10 penalty on saving throws made to remove negative levels bestowed by an energy drain attack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Occult Adventures pg. 240</em></p>\n<p>The orthodox view of the Inner Sphere casts the Negative Energy Plane as the jealous rival of its positive-energy twin, an empty infinite void of entropic darkness antithetical to creation, fit only to consume and destroy. Negative energy is itself a dark opposite of life-giving positive energy, yet while it is most often a source or tool of destruction, it is also the animating force of the undead. The ancient wisdom of occultism seizes on this seemingly paradoxical association with creation and posits that entropy clears the slate for what&rsquo;s next as the multiverse inexorably marches along an unimaginably vast evolutionary cycle of its own. Perfection is not a fixed state. It is always growing and changing. To say that there is one &ldquo;natural&rdquo; state&mdash;for instance, utter oblivion&mdash;that constitutes perfection is as impossible as imposing a limit on the infinite. Occultists believe that this destruction allows for and drives change.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, negative energy sustains the undead, who throng to the sterile and desolate gulfs of nothingness that compose the overwhelming expanse of this dark and terrifying realm. The plane offers few solid surfaces, so the undead present here tend to be incorporeal and capable of taking flight on the soul-chilling currents that seem inexorably to guide visitors toward the absolute darkness at the plane&rsquo;s heart. This inner blackness connects via portals to the black holes scattered about the cosmos of the Material Plane. Records of astral voyages to the Material Plane side of these portals relate tales of the accretion disks of black holes swarming with incorporeal undead trapped within the event horizon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Within the plane, where the concentration of negative energy reaches an absolute, it begins to manifest a crystalline material that grows into beautiful and deadly structures of absolute entropy. When these crystals form strange angles, the plane gives birth to a sceaduinar. These vile creatures hate life and unlife alike, and exist only to sow entropy and destruction. Somehow, their manifestation seems to drain a measure of the plane&rsquo;s entropic energies, ironically making the regions around these haunting snowflake structures the most stable and survivable regions in the otherwise hostile plane. While negative energy is less of a concern, the sceaduinar themselves represent a significant threat to visitors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ancient wisdom suggests that the jyoti hate the sceaduinar for their knowledge of the role destruction plays in the creation of souls, and the jyoti fear the exposure of that information. The Negative Energy Plane&rsquo;s most terrible and hateful residents, the undead abominations known as nightshades, care little for this squabbling between the planes. Theirs is a quest to eradicate all life in the cosmos, to cloak the stars of the Material Plane in darkness, and to quench the Cosmic Fire, no matter the consequences.</p>\n<p>The Negative Energy Plane is the realm of constant entropy and never-ending destruction, a lightless void of nothingness that destroys the raw force of life and gives rise to the animating force of undeath.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vacuous and barren, devoid of any natural path for souls after judgment, the Negative Energy Plane has no divinity who calls it home. The goddesses and gods have little interest in the plane as a whole, barring occasional attention from servitors and priests of various gods of undeath and entropy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Denizens</h2>\n<p>The Negative Energy Plane destroys life and most forms of matter, yet still, there are denizens of the realm. By far the most common are undead&mdash;particularly those without physical bodies. Wraiths are the most commonly encountered, for when a mortal creature dies on the Negative Energy Plane, a wraith often spawns during the process of death. In this case, the mortal&rsquo;s actual soul is not completely corrupted&mdash;what forms the wraith is scraped from the dying soul in a process that is metaphysically and emotionally excruciating. The resulting wraiths are almost mindless and have little other desire than to destroy any other form of life they come across in their aimless drifting through the Void. Other undead exist here as well, although most tend to manifest in isolated areas&mdash;only those present in significant numbers are mentioned on the encounter table.</p>\n<p>Few creatures call the negative energy plane home. Even fewer have travelers&rsquo; best interests at heart.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Liches, vampires, and other corporeal undead who come to bask in the negative energy plane&rsquo;s deadly energies soon grow horrified by the constant gnawing of entropy on their decaying bodies and worldly possessions. Of necessity, most gather in small floating-island city-states under authoritarian monarchs, pooling their resources to stave off the Nothing while engaging in research, trade, and what sybaritic pleasures their lord allows. Petty rivalries and resentments abound, but all differences are cast aside to fend off sceaduinar incursions or the impressment efforts of ambitious nightshades. Ironically, the safeguards that preserve these settlements also make them some of the safest places for living creatures in the negative energy plane as well. Adventurers who prove they&rsquo;re not cattle can earn outlandish fees as bodyguards, couriers, and sceaduinar hunters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nightshades lord over the negative energy plane&rsquo;s dead worlds and swim its rivers of entropy. Drawn to their power, spectral dead congregate around them like pilot fish around sharks. Nightshades rarely cooperate; instead, individual nightshades scheme against the realms of the living, ever looking for vulnerable worlds to colonize and raze.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The one true society of the negative energy plane belongs to the sceaduinars. Born divorced from existence&mdash;and out of geometrical errors at that&mdash;sceaduinars have an instinctive loathing for all creatures born with a spark of positive energy. This is reinforced by a xenophobic culture that calls them to repel any stain on the negative energy plane&rsquo;s purity: in particular, the parasitic abomination of undeath. Slaying undead is the closest thing sceaduinars have to a holy obligation, and they pursue it with fervor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sceaduinar society is also marked by ancestral hatred for the Positive Energy Plane&rsquo;s birdlike jyoti. According to their lore, sceaduinars and jyoti used to be equal shepherds of creation, tending the ebb and flow of positive and negative energy throughout the multiverse. Then the jyoti betrayed the sceaduinars, slamming shut the doors to the Cosmic Fire and hoarding the secrets of creation for themselves. Now the sceaduinars are locked in darkness while the multiverse marches inexorably from positive to negative, life to death, till the end of time. Yet they dream of a multiverse flowering with crystal negative life&mdash;and some sceaduinars plot to see this vision come to pass.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Corporeal Undead</h3>\n<p>Intelligent undead of all kinds make pilgrimages to the negative energy plane, particularly liches and graveknights.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Daemons</h3>\n<p>Driven by their all-consuming hatred for life, many daemons visit the Negative Energy Plane to study and conduct experiments. They rarely settle for long, however&mdash;there is scant mortal suffering to feed upon, and sceaduinars resent their presence. Of the daemons that persevere, most find their fates in becoming nightshades.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Danavas</h3>\n<p>At least one of these ancient titans is known to inhabit the negative energy plane, ruminating over strange artifacts and the deepest concentrations of captured crystalline energy. Moreover, this nameless titan is one of that race&rsquo;s great pillars&mdash;powerful beings who have evolved to become anchors of reality itself. Any action by this pillar would have multiverse-shaking implications, and his destruction might well hasten the end of existence. Danavas of lesser power may hide deeper in the negative energy plane as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Devourers</h3>\n<p>Transformed by fell energies at the edge of reality, devourers are held in suspicion by the negative energy plane&rsquo;s corporeal undead, yet they have no place among the spectral dead or the courts of the nightshades. Despite&mdash; or perhaps because of&mdash;their perennial outsider status, they often serve as emissaries and diplomats. They may also be heralds of darker forces deeper in the negative energy plane, including lesser deaths, grim reapers, and worse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Hunduns</h3>\n<p>Extradimensional beings from an unreality beyond the multiverse, these hooded monks come to the negative energy plane to study entropy and the destruction of existence. Often found on the highest perches along the Escarpment, their silent ruminations can last for eons. Hunduns are obsessive students of their hated foes, the danavas, and reward news of their enemies&rsquo; movements with occult secrets&mdash;revelations that, while true, set travelers on a path to ruin.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Incorporeal Undead</h3>\n<p>Wraiths are the plane&rsquo;s most common threat&mdash;spirit shreds sheared off mortals slain by the negative energy plane. Fortunately, these wraiths are merely imprints born of agony, while the original soul goes on to its ordained rest. But other victims of the plane are not so lucky. Souls stained by significant evil sometimes form dread wraiths, while those who perish in great anger rise as spectres, and victims consumed by madness or who commit suicide rise as allips. The plane&rsquo;s occasional consumption of whole realms can spawn other spirits&mdash;including banshees, callers in darkness, festering spirits, poltergeists, shadows, and wyrmwraiths. Most of these remain bound near the sites of their death until their eventual absorption into the Nothing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Movanic Devas</h3>\n<p>Detached from celestial infantries, these angelic volunteers see themselves as the multiverse&rsquo;s first line of defense against the negative energy plane&rsquo;s spectral hordes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Nightshades</h3>\n<p>Fiends of all stripes seek the power concentrated in the gulf between the Shadow and Negative Energy Planes. They rarely survive to regret their hubris. The Chasm breaks them down utterly, stripping them apart and refashioning them out of shadowstuff as new undead creatures. Collectively known as nightshades, these monstrosities seem to be manifestations of the negative energy plane itself, empowered by fiendish malice and sense of purpose. Able to cast plane shift daily, only their hatred for sunlight keeps them from obliterating world after world. Nightshades travel freely throughout the negative energy plane, gravitating toward environs that favor their umbral forms. Nightwalkers and nightprowlers lead shadow armies across dead worlds, as nightcrawlers bore beneath the surface, accelerating their eventual destruction. Nightskitters weave necromantic webs to ensnare prey along the Escarpment, while nightwings flock like bats above the plane&rsquo;s few landmarks. Practically demigods, the deadly nightwaves swim in rivers of entropy in the Chasm&rsquo;s depths. If there is a supreme intelligence that guides the nightshade race, as some sages postulate, it is likely found there.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Oblivions</h3>\n<p>Oblivions are the purest expression of the negative energy plane: roiling thunderclouds of negative energy that work to unmake creation. Each is independent, commands a crude intelligence, and seeks to lay waste to entire globes. Reality&rsquo;s saving grace is that oblivions cannot travel the planes on their own; when one does, it is often an extinction-level event. Oblivions manipulate spheres of annihilation with consummate skill. Indeed, far from being magical artifacts, these spheres may in fact be the eggs of the oblivion race&mdash;if such a term even applies to the oozes&rsquo; indecipherable life cycle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Sceaduinars</h3>\n<p>Resembling spindly gargoyles made of dark purple crystal, these outsiders dwell upon the negative energy plane&rsquo;s crystalline knots. Sceaduinars&rsquo; origins are unique, for unlike other creatures, they are born without positive energy. Instead they spontaneously generate from flaws in the crystal structure of their homes, shearing into being at odd angles and intersections that would otherwise mar the knot&rsquo;s integrity. Their skittering, wolfish mounts, sceazirs, originate in a similar manner. Sceaduinars create shard cities of glass along the arms of their snowflake homes, decorating them with smoky mirrors and filling them with the empty sound of chimes. They tend strange treelike outgrowths of negative energy crystal, coaxing spheres of annihilation to bud from jagged branches. They then use these orbs to defend against wraith attacks or set them drifting into the negative energy plane like deadly balloons&mdash;some of which make their way to other planes of existence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sceaduinars also send out death squads, parties of up to a dozen hunters and several sceazir mounts, using their supernatural invisibility to undead to pounce upon any such creatures they find. These raiding parties serve another function too: industrial espionage. Sceaduinars&rsquo; divorce from the Positive Energy Plane robs them of the ability to create. They can guide natural processes&mdash;hence their careful husbandry of nascent spheres&mdash;and they can copy or mimic, but they never truly invent.</p>\n<p>It is a cruel irony that, over time, sceaduinar cities tend to resemble the nearest dead world or undead redoubt. In spite of the sceaduinars&rsquo; best efforts to forge a destiny unique to themselves, their works inevitably mirror those of living beings they despise.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Umbral Dragons</h3>\n<p>Infused with negative energy while still in the egg, umbral dragons are one of the few living species that can tolerate the bleak essence of the negative energy plane. Most dwell along the Escarpment or on floating islands picked clean of undead and sceaduinars.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Void-Ravaged Creatures</h3>\n<p>Living creatures who survive in the negative energy plane eventually become acclimated, but not unchanged. They live on as the void-ravaged (Planar Adventures 117), creatures suspended between life and undeath. Most are lone individuals, but a few colonies of void-ravaged harpies and yrthaks squabble along the Escarpment. Elsewhere in the negative energy plane, an outpost of void-ravaged elves clings to the thicket that was their nation-tree, guarded by banshee ancestors.</p>"}

Designing Spells}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 129</em></p>\n<p>Low-level damage spells are not as good as medium- or high-level damage spells&mdash;the game is designed so lowerlevel spells eventually reach a maximum amount of damage they can deal. This is because if low-level spells continued to increase in damage without hitting a maximum amount, they&rsquo;d rival some higher-level spells for effectiveness, and the game isn&rsquo;t as interesting if casters are using the same spells at 20th level as they were at 1st.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The maximum damage depends on the level of the spell and whether the spell is arcane or divine. This is because arcane magic is deliberately designed to be better at dealing damage to balance the fact that divine magic is better at healing. A &ldquo;single target&rdquo; spell only damages one creature (like shocking grasp), or divides its damage among several creatures (like burning hands or magic missile). A &ldquo;multiple target&rdquo; spell applies its full damage to several creatures (like fireball).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, a 1st-level single-target wizard spell like shocking grasp can deal a maximum of 5 dice of damage (specifically 5d6). Magic missile can be used against a single target, or the caster can split up the missiles to affect multiple creatures, dividing the single-target damage among them. Burning hands initially looks like it doesn&rsquo;t obey the damage cap table because it deals multiple dice of damage against multiple creatures, but this is offset by the fact that it only deals d4s instead of d6s, and it has an extremely close and limited area of effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When looking at the Maximum Damage tables, also keep in mind that arcane spells usually use d6s for damage and divine spells usually use d8s, and these tables assume d6s; when looking at the damage caps for divine spells, count each d8 as 2d6. Thus, searing light is a 3rd-level single-target cleric spell that deals up to 5d8 points of damage; treating each d8 as 2d6, that counts as 10d6, which is on target for a 3rd-level cleric spell. (Note that the 1d6 per level and maximum 10d6 points of damage against undead are still correct for a spell of this level, and the slightly higher damage against light-vulnerable undead is offset by the reduced damage against constructs).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tip: If your spell does more damage than the amount defined on the table, you should reduce the damage or increase the spell&rsquo;s level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tip: If your spell does less damage than the amount defined on the table, you should increase the damage or add another effect to the spell. An example of this is sound burst, which only deals 1d8 points of damage (this amount never increases), but can stun creatures in the area.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 2-5: Maximum Damage for Arcane Spells</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 69.2156%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.5867%;\" scope=\"col\">Spell Level</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.858%;\" scope=\"col\">Max Damage (Single Target)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.7334%;\" scope=\"col\">Max Damage (Multiple Targets)</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.5867%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.858%;\">5 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.7334%;\">-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.5867%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.858%;\">10 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.7334%;\">5 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.5867%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.858%;\">10 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.7334%;\">10 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.5867%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.858%;\">15 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.7334%;\">10 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.5867%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.858%;\">15 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.7334%;\">15 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.5867%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.858%;\">20 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.7334%;\">15 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.5867%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.858%;\">20 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.7334%;\">20 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.5867%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.858%;\">25 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.7334%;\">20 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 18.5867%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 38.858%;\">25 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 41.7334%;\">25 dice</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Table 2-6: Maximum Damage for Divine Spells</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 73.8756%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15.6164%;\" scope=\"col\">Spell Level</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.4521%;\" scope=\"col\">Max Damage (Single Target)</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1096%;\" scope=\"col\">Max Damage (Multiple Targets)</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15.6164%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.4521%;\">1 die</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1096%;\">-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15.6164%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.4521%;\">5 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1096%;\">1 die</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15.6164%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.4521%;\">10 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1096%;\">5 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15.6164%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.4521%;\">10 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1096%;\">10 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15.6164%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.4521%;\">15 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1096%;\">10 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15.6164%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.4521%;\">15 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1096%;\">15 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15.6164%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.4521%;\">20 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1096%;\">15 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15.6164%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.4521%;\">20 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1096%;\">20 dice</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 15.6164%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"width: 39.4521%;\">25 dice</td>\n<td style=\"width: 44.1096%;\">20 dice</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}

Air Vehicles}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Combat pg. 170</em></p>\n<p>What follow are the basic rules for using vehicles in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. They give an overview of the rules that all vehicles use.</p>\n<h2>Drivers</h2>\n<p>Drivers control vehicles. A driver is a creature with an Intelligence score of at least 3 who is physically able to manipulate a vehicle&rsquo;s driving device and who is both within the driving spaces of a vehicle and actively manipulating the driving device.</p>\n<h2>Occupants</h2>\n<p>Any creature riding, driving, serving as crew on, or providing propulsion for a vehicle is considered its occupant.</p>\n<h2>Facing</h2>\n<p>Unlike characters, vehicles have a forward facing. A vehicle moves best when it moves in the direction of its forward facing.</p>\n<h2>Acceleration/Deceleration</h2>\n<p>Vehicles must accelerate to reach their maximum speed. Each round, with the proper driving action and a successful check, the driver can increase the vehicle&rsquo;s movement by its rate of acceleration, as long that value is no greater than the vehicle&rsquo;s maximum speed. Vehicles must decelerate to slow down and are hard to stop at an exact point.</p>\n<h2>Initiative</h2>\n<p>A vehicle moves at the start of its driver&rsquo;s turn. If a vehicle has no driver, it moves on the turn of the last creature that was its driver, or on a turn determined by the GM.</p>\n<h2>Controlling a Vehicle</h2>\n<p>If a vehicle has a driver, before the driver does anything else on her turn, she must determine what drive action she is taking, and take that action. If the driver takes no action, takes some other action instead of driving the vehicle, or delays or readies an action&mdash;or if there is no driver&mdash;the vehicle takes the &ldquo;uncontrolled&rdquo; action. A driver can only take one action each turn to control a vehicle. Once the driver has selected the action, or takes some other action forcing the vehicle to become uncontrolled, the vehicle moves.</p>\n<h2>Driving Check</h2>\n<p>When a driver takes a driving action, she must make a driving check to determine the maneuverability and speed of the vehicle that round. The vehicle&rsquo;s propulsion determines what skill is used for the driving check. A driver can always make a Wisdom check in place of a driving check. The base DCs for all driving checks are DC 5 and DC 20. Use the lower DC when the driver is not in combat and the higher DC when the driver is in combat.</p>\n<h2>In Combat</h2>\n<p>Vehicles, creatures used as propulsion, and crew members do not threaten any area around them, but their drivers and their non-crew occupants do. Vehicles can enter the spaces of objects and creatures smaller than themselves. Vehicles do not have attacks, but they can&mdash;and may be required to&mdash; make vehicular bull rush, vehicular overrun, and ramming combat maneuvers.</p>"}

Trip}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 199</em></p>\n<p>As a standard action, you can attempt to grapple a foe, hindering his combat options. If you do not have Improved Grapple, grab, or a similar ability, attempting to grapple a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from the target of your maneuver. Humanoid creatures without two free hands attempting to grapple a foe take a &ndash;4 penalty on the combat maneuver roll. If successful, both you and the target gain the grappled condition (see the Appendices). If you successfully grapple a creature that is not adjacent to you, move that creature to an adjacent open space (if no space is available, your grapple fails).</p>\n<p>Although both creatures have the grappled condition, you can, as the creature that initiated the grapple, release the grapple as a free action, removing the condition from both you and the target. If you do not release the grapple, you must continue to make a check each round, as a standard action, to maintain the hold. If your target does not break the grapple, you get a +5 circumstance bonus on grapple checks made against the same target in subsequent rounds. Once you are grappling an opponent, a successful check allows you to continue grappling the foe, and also allows you to perform one of the following actions (as part of the standard action spent to maintain the grapple).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Move</h2>\n<p>You can move both yourself and your target up to half your speed. At the end of your movement, you can place your target in any square adjacent to you. If you attempt to place your foe in a hazardous location, such as in a wall of fire or over a pit, the target receives a free attempt to break your grapple with a +4 bonus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Damage</h2>\n<p>You can inflict damage to your target equal to your unarmed strike, a natural attack, or an attack made with armor spikes or a light or one-handed weapon. This damage can be either lethal or nonlethal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Pin</h2>\n<p>You can give your opponent the pinned condition (see Appendix 2). Despite pinning your opponent, you still only have the grappled condition, but you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Tie Up</h2>\n<p>If you have your target pinned, otherwise restrained, or unconscious, you can use rope to tie him up. This works like a pin effect, but the DC to escape the bonds is equal to 20 + your Combat Maneuver Bonus (instead of your CMD). The ropes do not need to make a check every round to maintain the pin. If you are grappling the target, you can attempt to tie him up in ropes, but doing so requires a combat maneuver check at a &ndash;10 penalty. If the DC to escape from these bindings is higher than 20 + the target&rsquo;s CMB, the target cannot escape from the bonds, even with a natural 20 on the check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>If You Are Grappled</h2>\n<p>If you are grappled, you can attempt to break the grapple as a standard action by making a combat maneuver check (DC equal to your opponent&rsquo;s CMD; this does not provoke an attack of opportunity) or Escape Artist check (with a DC equal to your opponent&rsquo;s CMD). If you succeed, you break the grapple and can act normally. Alternatively, if you succeed, you can become the grappler, grappling the other creature (meaning that the other creature cannot freely release the grapple without making a combat maneuver check, while you can). Instead of attempting to break or reverse the grapple, you can take any action that doesn&rsquo;t require two hands to perform, such as cast a spell or make an attack or full attack with a light or one-handed weapon against any creature within your reach, including the creature that is grappling you. See the grappled condition for additional details. If you are pinned, your actions are very limited. See the pinned condition in Appendix 2 for additional details.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Multiple Creatures</h2>\n<p>Multiple creatures can attempt to grapple one target. The creature that first initiates the grapple is the only one that makes a check, with a +2 bonus for each creature that assists in the grapple (using the Aid Another action). Multiple creatures can also assist another creature in breaking free from a grapple, with each creature that assists (using the Aid Another action) granting a +2 bonus on the grappled creature&rsquo;s combat maneuver check.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Grapple Flow Chart</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a7/d0/a1/a7d0a156d385b7f0763d90fe99be106a.png\" alt=\"Grapple Flow Chart\" width=\"708\" height=\"937\" /></p>"}

Spells that create nonmagical materials that then strike or impede creatures (such as ice storm and sleet storm) do not normally require a saving throw.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spells that require the caster to make an attack roll to hit (even if it&rsquo;s a ranged touch attack) may or may not require a saving throw (enervation and searing light do not, disintegrate does). Attack effects that do not require rolling damage should always allow a saving throw to reduce or negate the effect; otherwise, the spell becomes an obvious choice for anyone of the level to cast it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tip: When deciding whether or not the spell should have a saving throw, consider how you&rsquo;d feel if someone used the spell on your favorite PC. If your PC didn&rsquo;t get any chance to resist the effect with a save or to dodge it entirely because of a failed attack roll, would you be annoyed, embarrassed, or angry? If so, you should give the spell some kind of save or attack roll, just so it&rsquo;s not an always-effective option.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Fortitude Saves</h2>\n<p>Spells with Fortitude saves usually physically transform the target, apply an effect you&rsquo;d normally resist with a Fortitude save (such as disease or poison), or are a form of attack that sheer physical toughness is enough to resist. In general, making a successful Fortitude save means the effect hits, but the target toughs it out, like a bear shrugging off the stinky musk sprayed by a skunk. Note that if your spell only affects creatures&mdash;not objects&mdash;then nonliving creatures such as constructs and undead are immune to the spell. For example, this makes them immune to creature-oriented polymorphing spells, but not spells such as disintegrate, which can attack objects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Reflex Save</h2>\n<p>Spells with Reflex saves usually create a physical burst or spread in an area, like an explosion, which the target is able to dodge with a successful saving throw. In general, making a successful Reflex save means the target dodged the effect, or the effect rolled over or around the target with a lesser effect. Note that you shouldn&rsquo;t build a spell where the caster makes an attack roll and the target also makes a Reflex saving throw; doing so brings Dexterity into play twice for the same spell (once for the target&rsquo;s AC, once for the target&rsquo;s Reflex save modifier).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Will Saves</h2>\n<p>Spells with Will saves are mental, mind-affecting attacks; the target resists with pure mental power, by using evasive thoughts or noticing flaws in the spell&rsquo;s assault that can negate its effectiveness. A Will save is like a mental version of a Fortitude save; the effect &ldquo;hits&rdquo; the target, and whether or not it succeeds depends on the target&rsquo;s willpower. Most direct-attack Will-save spells (such as sleep and phantasmal killer) are mind-affecting effects (see Descriptors, below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some spells can be cast on objects, and the object only gets a saving throw if it is a magic item or is held by a creature; these spells should have &ldquo;(object)&rdquo; listed after the type of saving throw (see shrink item).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Helpful spells and spells that do not harm the target in any way either should have no saving throw, or should allow a saving throw but have &ldquo;(harmless)&rdquo; listed after the type of saving throw (see fly).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spells that only affect the caster never require a saving throw (you&rsquo;d never try to resist a beneficial spell you&rsquo;re casting on yourself ), so you don&rsquo;t list a saving throw for those spells at all (see true strike).</p>"}

They tend to move in the direction of their forward facing, and do so quickly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Facing</h2>\n<p>Unlike creatures, most vehicles have a forward facing. The facing of the vehicle determines its best path of propulsion. Vehicles are very good at moving in the direction of their forward facing, but it takes time and skill to move them in other directions. A horse-pulled wagon moves forward quickly and with ease, but turning a corner requires proper timing and a crack of the whip. A ship propelled by an air current can take a great deal of effort to stop, especially once it has reached top speed. Vehicle facing represents the effect of inertia on vehicles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When driven correctly, vehicles can move straight ahead, diagonally, or a mix of both within the same movement. Skilled drivers can make a vehicle zigzag in a forward direction with ease.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Movement</h2>\n<p>Vehicles have a maximum speed and an acceleration listing. The speed is the fastest rate the vehicle can travel. When a creature or creatures pull a vehicle, the vehicle&rsquo;s maximum speed is equal to twice the speed of the creature providing the propulsion, and its acceleration is the creature&rsquo;s speed. (Teams of mixed creature types use the slowest creature&rsquo;s speed.) A vehicle cannot start at its maximum speed, unless it has some form of high-level magic propulsion. Each round, the driver can attempt to accelerate the vehicle or decelerate it by a rate equal to its acceleration (see Driving Vehicles below). The rate at which a vehicle is currently moving is called its current speed.</p>"}

When you design a spell, you have to take those power levels into account by comparing the new spell to existing spells in the Core Rulebook&mdash;a spell has to fall into the narrow range of power for one of the nine spell levels (plus cantrips or orisons). In contrast, prices for magic items are strongly granular, and are calculated to the gold piece based on precisely what features the item possesses. In other words, if you add more power to a magic item, you just increase its price to compensate, but if you add too much power to a spell, you have to make it a higher-level spell, which means you then have to compare it to a different set of example spells.</p>"}

Aquatic Terrain}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 432</em></p>\n<p>Aquatic terrain is the least hospitable to most PCs, because they can&rsquo;t breathe there. Aquatic terrain doesn&rsquo;t offer the variety that land terrain does. The ocean floor holds many marvels, including undersea analogues of any of the terrain elements described earlier in this section, but if characters find themselves in the water because they were bull rushed off the deck of a pirate ship, the tall kelp beds hundreds of feet below them don&rsquo;t matter. Accordingly, these rules simply divide aquatic terrain into two categories: flowing water (such as streams and rivers) and non-flowing water (such as lakes and oceans).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.r4t1MHGGd6myKln7]{3.2.8.1. Underwater Combat}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.AlMWpchX9rOkfomx]{3.2.8.2. Floods}</p>\n<h2>Flowing Water</h2>\n<p>Large, placid rivers move at only a few miles per hour, so they function as still water for most purposes. But some rivers and streams are swifter; anything floating in them moves downstream at a speed of 10 to 40 feet per round. The fastest rapids send swimmers bobbing downstream at 60 to 90 feet per round. Fast rivers are always at least rough water (Swim DC 15), and whitewater rapids are stormy water (Swim DC 20). If a character is in moving water, move her downstream the indicated distance at the end of her turn. A character trying to maintain her position relative to the riverbank can spend some or all of her turn swimming upstream.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Swept Away</h2>\n<p>Characters swept away by a river moving 60 feet per round or faster must make DC 20 Swim checks every round to avoid going under. If a character gets a check result of 5 or more over the minimum necessary, she arrests her motion by catching a rock, tree limb, or bottom snag&mdash;she is no longer being carried along by the flow of the water. Escaping the rapids by reaching the bank requires three DC 20 Swim checks in a row. Characters arrested by a rock, limb, or snag can&rsquo;t escape under their own power unless they strike out into the water and attempt to swim their way clear. Other characters can rescue them as if they were trapped in quicksand (described in Marsh Terrain).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Non-Flowing Water</h2>\n<p>Lakes and oceans simply require a swim speed or successful Swim checks to move through (DC 10 in calm water, DC 15 in rough water, DC 20 in stormy water). Characters need a way to breathe if they&rsquo;re underwater; failing that, they risk drowning. When underwater, characters can move in any direction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stealth and Detection Underwater</h2>\n<p>How far you can see underwater depends on the water&rsquo;s clarity. As a guideline, creatures can see 4d8 &times; 10 feet if the water is clear, and 1d8 &times; 10 feet if it&rsquo;s murky. Moving water is always murky, unless it&rsquo;s in a particularly large, slow-moving river.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find cover or concealment to hide underwater (except along the sea floor).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Invisibility</h2>\n<p>An invisible creature displaces water and leaves a visible, body-shaped &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; where the water was displaced. The creature still has concealment (20% miss chance), but not total concealment (50% miss chance).</p>"}

Spell Resistance}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 555</em></p>\n<p>From curses to poisons to diseases, there are a number of afflictions that can affect a creature. While each of these afflictions has a different effect, they all function using the same basic system. All afflictions grant a saving throw when they are contracted. If successful, the creature does not suffer from the affliction and does not need to make any further rolls. If the saving throw is Table must deal with its effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Afflictions require a creature to make a saving throw after a period of time to avoid taking certain penalties. With most afflictions, if a number of saving throws are made consecutively, the affliction is removed and no further saves are necessary. Some afflictions, usually supernatural ones, cannot be cured through saving throws alone and require the aid of powerful magic to remove.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each affliction is presented as a short block of information to help you better adjudicate its results.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Name</h2>\n<p>This is the name of the affliction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Type</h2>\n<p>This is the type of the affliction, such as curse, disease, or poison. It might also include the means by which it is contracted, such as contact, ingestion, inhalation, injury, spell, or trap.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Save</h2>\n<p>This gives the type of save necessary to avoid contracting the affliction, as well as the DC of that save. Unless otherwise noted, this is also the save to avoid the affliction&rsquo;s effects once it is contracted, as well as the DC of any caster level checks needed to end the affliction through magic, such as remove curse or neutralize poison.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Onset</h2>\n<p>Some afflictions have a variable amount of time before they set in. Creatures that come in contact with an affliction with an onset time must make a saving throw immediately. Success means that the affliction is avoided and no further saving throws must be made. Failure means that the creature has contracted the affliction and must begin making additional saves after the onset period has elapsed. The affliction&rsquo;s effect does not occur until after the onset period has elapsed and then only if further saving throws are failed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Frequency</h2>\n<p>This is how often the periodic saving throw must be attempted after the affliction has been contracted (after the onset time, if the affliction has any). While some afflictions last until they are cured, others end prematurely, even if the character is not cured through other means. If an affliction ends after a set amount of time, it will be noted in the frequency. For example, a disease with a frequency of &ldquo;1/ day&rdquo; lasts until cured, but a poison with a frequency of &ldquo;1/ round for 6 rounds&rdquo; ends after 6 rounds have passed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Afflictions without a frequency occur only once, immediately upon contraction (or after the onset time if one is listed).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Effect</h2>\n<p>This is the effect that the character suffers each time if he fails his saving throw against the affliction. Most afflictions cause ability damage or hit point damage. These effects are cumulative, but they can be cured normally. Other afflictions cause the creature to take penalties or other effects. These effects are sometimes cumulative, with the rest only affecting the creature if it failed its most recent save. Some afflictions have different effects after the first save is failed. These afflictions have an initial effect, which occurs when the first save is failed, and a secondary effect, when additional saves are failed, as noted in the text. Hit point and ability score damage caused by an affliction cannot be healed naturally while the affliction persists.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cure</h2>\n<p>This tells you how the affliction is cured. Commonly, this is a number of saving throws that must be made consecutively. Even if the affliction has a limited frequency, it might be cured prematurely if enough saving throws are made. Hit point damage and ability score damage is not removed when an affliction is cured. Such damage must be healed normally. Afflictions without a cure entry can only be cured through powerful spells, such as neutralize poison and remove curse. No matter how many saving throws are made, these afflictions continue to affect the target.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p>Valeros has been exposed to the red ache disease. He failed a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid contracting it, so after the onset period of 1d3 days has passed, he must make another DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid taking 1d6 points of Strength damage. From this point onward, he must make a DC 15 Fortitude save each day (according to the disease&rsquo;s frequency) to avoid further Strength damage. If, on two consecutive days, he makes his Fortitude saves, he is cured of the disease and any damage it caused begins to heal as normal.</p>"}

Traits}</strong></li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.CgVqFS1fjMtDuoH0]{1.2.7. Subraces}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Advanced Player's Guide pg. 326</em></p>\n<p>Character traits are abilities that are not tied to your character&rsquo;s race or class. They can enhance your character&rsquo;s skills, racial abilities, class abilities, or other statistics, enabling you to further customize him. At its core, a character trait is approximately equal in power to half a feat, so two character traits are roughly equivalent to a bonus feat. Yet a character trait isn&rsquo;t just another kind of power you can add on to your character&mdash;it&rsquo;s a way to quantify (and encourage) building a character background that fits into your campaign world.</p>\n<p>Think of character traits as &ldquo;story seeds&rdquo; for your background; after you pick your two traits, you&rsquo;ll have a point of inspiration from which to build your character&rsquo;s personality and history. Alternatively, if you&rsquo;ve already got a background in your head or written down for your character, you can view picking his traits as a way to quantify that background, just as picking race and class and ability scores quantifies his other strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many traits grant a new type of bonus: a &ldquo;trait&rdquo; bonus. Trait bonuses do not stack&mdash;they&rsquo;re intended to give player characters a slight edge, not a secret backdoor way to focus all of a character&rsquo;s traits on one type of bonus and thus gain an unseemly advantage. It&rsquo;s certainly possible, for example, that somewhere down the line, a &ldquo;Courageous&rdquo; trait might be on the list of dwarf race traits, but just because this trait is on both the dwarf race traits list and the basic combat traits list doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re any more brave if you choose both versions than if you choose only one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Character traits are only for player characters. If you want an NPC to have traits, that NPC must &ldquo;buy&rdquo; them with the Additional Traits feat. Player characters are special; they&rsquo;re the stars of the game, after all, and it makes sense that they have an advantage over the NPCs of the world in this way.</p>\n<h2>Gaining Traits</h2>\n<p><strong>Source </strong><em>Advanced Player's Guide pg. 326</em></p>\n<p>When you create your character for a campaign, ask your GM how many traits you can select. In most cases, a new PC should gain two traits, effectively gaining what amounts to a bonus feat at character creation.</p>\n<p>Some GMs may wish to adjust this number somewhat, depending upon their style of play; you may only be able to pick one trait, or your GM might allow three or more. Even if your GM normally doesn&rsquo;t allow bonus traits, you might still be able to pick up some with the Additional Traits feat.</p>\n<h2>Types of Traits</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Advanced Player's Guide pg. 326</em></p>\n<p>There are five types of character traits to choose from: basic (split among four categories: Combat, Faith, Magic, and Social), campaign, race, regional, and religion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Basic Traits</strong></h3>\n<p>There are a total of 40 basic traits, which are split evenly among the categories of Combat, Faith, Magic, and Social. Note that each of these four categories roughly equates to the four modes of adventuring, but aren&rsquo;t tied to specific classes. It&rsquo;s perfectly possible to have a religious rogue, for example, or a magic-obsessed fighter. Basic traits are &ldquo;generic,&rdquo; and should be able to fit into any campaign setting with a minimum of customization.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Campaign Traits</strong></h3>\n<p>These traits are specifically tailored to give new characters an instant hook into a new campaign. Campaign traits tailored to a specific Pathfinder Adventure Path can always be found in that Adventure Path&rsquo;s Player&rsquo;s Guide.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Race Traits</strong></h3>\n<p>Race traits are keyed to specific races or ethnicities, which your character must belong to in order to select the trait. If your race or ethnicity changes at some later point (perhaps as a result of polymorph magic or a reincarnation spell), the benefits gained by your race trait persist&mdash;only if your mind and memories change as well do you lose the benefits of a race trait.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Regional Traits</strong></h3>\n<p>Regional traits are keyed to specific regions, be they large (such as a nation or geographic region) or small (such as a city or a specific mountain). In order to select a regional trait, your PC must have spent at least a year living in that region. At 1st level, you can only select one regional trait (typically the one tied to your character&rsquo;s place of birth or homeland), despite the number of regions you might wish to write into your character&rsquo;s background.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Religion Traits</strong></h3>\n<p>Religion traits indicate that your character has an established faith in a specific deity; you need not be a member of a class that can wield divine magic to pick a religion trait, but you do have to have a patron deity and have some amount of religion in your background to justify this trait. Unlike the other categories of traits, religion traits can go away if you abandon your religion, as detailed below under Restrictions on Trait Selection.</p>\n<h2>Restrictions on Trait Selection</h2>\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Advanced Player's Guide pg. 326</em></p>\n<p>There are a few rules governing trait selection. To begin with, your GM controls how many bonus traits a PC begins with; the default assumption is two traits. When selecting traits, you may not select more than one from the same list of traits (the four basic traits each count as a separate list for this purpose). Certain types of traits may have additional requirements, as detailed in the section above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Remember also that traits are intended to model events that were formative in your character&rsquo;s development, either events from before he became an adventurer, or (in the case of additional traits gained via the Additional Traits feat) ones that happened while adventuring. Even if your character becomes a hermit and abandons society, he&rsquo;ll still retain his legacy of growing up an aristocrat if he took the relevant social trait. The one exception to this is religion traits&mdash;since these traits require continued faith in a specific deity, your character can indeed lose the benefits of these traits if he switches religions.</p>\n<p>In this case, consult your GM for your options. She may simply rule that your character loses that trait, or she might allow him to pick a new religion trait tied to his new deity. Another option is that if your character abandons a religion, he loses the associated religion trait until he gains an experience level, at which point he may replace a lost religion trait with a basic faith trait.</p>"}

In addition, whenever a character gains a level, she earns an additional hero point. Aside from these basic rules, awarding additional hero points is up to the GM. The following options are just some of the ways that a GM might award additional hero points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Character Story</h2>\n<p>GMs can award a hero point for the completion of a written character backstory. This reward encourages players to take an active role in the history of the game. In addition, the GM can use this backstory to generate a pivotal moment for your character concerning his past. When this key event is resolved, the GM can reward another hero point. Alternatively, the GM might award a hero point for painting a miniature or drawing a character portrait in the likeness of your character, helping the rest of the group visualize your hero.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Completing Plot Arcs</h2>\n<p>The GM might award a hero point to each of the PCs who were involved in completing a major chapter or arc in the campaign story. These hero points are awarded at the conclusion of the arc if the PCs were successful or advanced the story in a meaningful way.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Faith</h2>\n<p>In a campaign where the gods play an important role in every character&rsquo;s life, hero points might represent their favor. In such a setting, the GM can award hero points to characters whenever they uphold the tenets of their faith in a grand way, or whenever they take on one of the faith&rsquo;s major enemies. Such hero points might be temporary, and if not spent on the task at hand, they fade away.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Group Service</h2>\n<p>The GM can award hero points for acts outside the game as well. Buying pizza for the group, helping to clean up afterwards, or even hosting the game for a night might be worth a hero point. This sort of hero point should be given out of generosity, not as a payment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Heroic Acts</h2>\n<p>Whenever a character performs an exceptionally heroic act, she can be awarded a hero point. This might include anything from slaying an evil dragon when the rest of the group has f led to rescuing townsfolk from a burning building despite being terribly wounded. It does not have to be related to combat. Convincing the reticent king to send troops to help with a bandit problem or successfully jumping a wide chasm might earn a character a hero point, depending on the circumstances.

Common Terms","flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_e2u03yzpxzl"}},"content":"<p>@Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.8scSEgBEtJZj0suf]{(Index) Basic Rules}</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 11</em></p>\n<p>The Pathfinder RPG uses a number of terms, abbreviations, and definitions in presenting the rules of the game. The following are among the most common.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Ability Score</strong>: Each creature has six ability scores: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These scores represent a creature&rsquo;s most basic attributes. The higher the score, the more raw potential and talent your character possesses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Action</strong>: An action is a discrete measurement of time during a round of combat. Using abilities, casting spells, and making attacks all require actions to perform. There are a number of different kinds of actions, such as a standard action, move action, swift action, free action, and full-round action (see Chapter 8).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Alignment represents a creature&rsquo;s basic moral and ethical attitude. Alignment has two components: one describing whether a creature is lawful, neutral, or chaotic, followed by another that describes whether a character is good, neutral, or evil. Alignments are usually abbreviated using the first letter of each alignment component, such as LN for lawful neutral or CE for chaotic evil. Creatures that are neutral in both components are denoted by a single &ldquo;N.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Armor Class (AC)</strong>: All creatures in the game have an Armor Class. This score represents how hard it is to hit a creature in combat. As with other scores, higher is better.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Base Attack Bonus (BAB)</strong>: Each creature has a base attack bonus and it represents its skill in combat. As a character gains levels or Hit Dice, his base attack bonus improves. When a creature&rsquo;s base attack bonus reaches +6, +11, or +16, he receives an additional attack in combat when he takes a full-attack action (which is one type of full-round action&mdash;see Chapter 8).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: Bonuses are numerical values that are added to checks and statistical scores. Most bonuses have a type, and as a general rule, bonuses of the same type are not cumulative (do not &ldquo;stack&rdquo;)&mdash;only the greater bonus granted applies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Caster Level (CL)</strong>: Caster level represents a creature&rsquo;s power and ability when casting spells. When a creature casts a spell, it often contains a number of variables, such as range or damage, that are based on the caster&rsquo;s level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Class</strong>: Classes represent chosen professions taken by characters and some other creatures. Classes give a host of bonuses and allow characters to take actions that they otherwise could not, such as casting spells or changing shape. As a creature gains levels in a given class, it gains new, more powerful abilities. Most PCs gain levels in the core classes or prestige classes, since these are the most powerful (see Chapters 3 and 11). Most NPCs gain levels in NPC classes, which are less powerful (see Chapter 14).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> A check is a d20 roll which may or may not be modified by another value. The most common types are attack rolls, skill checks, ability checks, and saving throws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Maneuver</strong>: This is an action taken in combat that does not directly cause harm to your opponent, such as attempting to trip him, disarm him, or grapple with him (see Chapter 8).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Maneuver Bonus (CMB)</strong>: This value represents how skilled a creature is at performing a combat maneuver. When attempting to perform a combat maneuver, this value is added to the character&rsquo;s d20 roll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Combat Maneuver Defense (CMD)</strong>: This score represents how hard it is to perform a combat maneuver against this creature. A creature&rsquo;s CMD is used as the difficulty class when performing a maneuver against that creature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Concentration Check</strong>: When a creature is casting a spell, but is disrupted during the casting, he must make a concentration check or fail to cast the spell (see Chapter 9).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Creature:</strong> A creature is an active participant in the story or world. This includes PCs, NPCs, and monsters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Damage Reduction (DR)</strong>: Creatures that are resistant to harm typically have damage reduction. This amount is subtracted from any damage dealt to them from a physical source. Most types of DR can be bypassed by certain types of weapons. This is denoted by a &ldquo;/&rdquo; followed by the type, such as &ldquo;10/cold iron.&rdquo; Some types of DR apply to all physical attacks. Such DR is denoted by the &ldquo;&mdash;&rdquo; symbol. See Appendix 1 for more information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Difficulty Class (DC):</strong> Whenever a creature attempts to perform an action whose success is not guaranteed, he must make some sort of check (usually a skill check). The result of that check must meet or exceed the Difficulty Class of the action that the creature is attempting to perform in order for the action to be successful.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Extraordinary Abilities (Ex):</strong> Extraordinary abilities are unusual abilities that do not rely on magic to function.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Experience Points (XP):</strong> As a character overcomes challenges, defeats monsters, and completes quests, he gains experience points. These points accumulate over time, and when they reach or surpass a specific value, the character gains a level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Feat</strong>: A feat is an ability a creature has mastered. Feats often allow creatures to circumvent rules or restrictions. Creatures receive a number of feats based off their Hit Dice, but some classes and other abilities grant bonus feats.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Game Master (GM):</strong> A Game Master is the person who adjudicates the rules and controls all of the elements of the story and world that the players explore. A GM&rsquo;s duty is to provide a fair and fun game.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Dice (HD)</strong>: Hit Dice represent a creature&rsquo;s general level of power and skill. As a creature gains levels, it gains additional Hit Dice. Monsters, on the other hand, gain racial Hit Dice, which represent the monster&rsquo;s general prowess and ability. Hit Dice are represented by the number the creature possesses followed by a type of die, such as &ldquo;3d8.&rdquo; This value is used to determine a creature&rsquo;s total hit points. In this example, the creature has 3 Hit Dice. When rolling for this creature&rsquo;s hit points, you would roll a d8 three times and add the results together, along with other modifiers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points (hp)</strong>: Hit points are an abstraction signifying how robust and healthy a creature is at the current moment. To determine a creature&rsquo;s hit points, roll the dice indicated by its Hit Dice. A creature gains maximum hit points if its first Hit Die roll is for a character class level. Creatures whose first Hit Die comes from an NPC class or from his race roll their first Hit Die normally. Wounds subtract hit points, while healing (both natural and magical) restores hit points. Some abilities and spells grant temporary hit points that disappear after a specific duration. When a creature&rsquo;s hit points drop below 0, it becomes unconscious. When a creature&rsquo;s hit points reach a negative total equal to its Constitution score, it dies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Initiative</strong>: Whenever combat begins, all creatures involved in the battle must make an initiative check to determine the order in which creatures act during combat. The higher the result of the check, the earlier a creature gets to act.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Level:</strong> A character&rsquo;s level represents his overall ability and power. There are three types of levels. Class level is the number of levels of a specific class possessed by a character. Character level is the sum of all of the levels possessed by a character in all of his classes. In addition, spells have a level associated with them numbered from 0 to 9. This level indicates the general power of the spell. As a spellcaster gains levels, he learns to cast spells of a higher level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Monster</strong>: Monsters are creatures that rely on racial Hit Dice instead of class levels for their powers and abilities (although some possess class levels as well). PCs are usually not monsters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Multiplying</strong>: When you are asked to apply more than one multiplier to a roll, the multipliers are not multiplied by one another. Instead, you combine them into a single multiplier, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. For example, if you are asked to apply a &times;2 multiplier twice, the result would be &times;3, not &times;4.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Nonplayer Character (NPC)</strong>: These are characters controlled by the GM.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Penalty:</strong> Penalties are numerical values that are subtracted from a check or statistical score. Penalties do not have a type and most penalties stack with one another.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Player Character (Character, PC)</strong>: These are the characters portrayed by the players.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Round:</strong> Combat is measured in rounds. During an individual round, all creatures have a chance to take a turn to act, in order of initiative. A round represents 6 seconds in the game world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Rounding:</strong> Occasionally the rules ask you to round a result or value. Unless otherwise stated, always round down. For example, if you are asked to take half of 7, the result would be 3.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Throw:</strong> When a creature is the subject of a dangerous spell or effect, it often receives a saving throw to mitigate the damage or result. Saving throws are passive, meaning that a character does not need to take an action to make a saving throw&mdash;they are made automatically. There are three types of saving throws: Fortitude (used to resist poisons, diseases, and other bodily ailments), Ref lex (used to avoid effects that target an entire area, such as fireball), and Will (used to resist mental attacks and spells).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skill</strong>: A skill represents a creature&rsquo;s ability to perform an ordinary task, such as climb a wall, sneak down a hallway, or spot an intruder. The number of ranks possessed by a creature in a given skill represents its proficiency in that skill. As a creature gains Hit Dice, it also gains additional skill ranks that can be added to its skills.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Spell</strong>: Spells can perform a wide variety of tasks, from harming enemies to bringing the dead back to life. Spells specify what they can target, what their effects are, and how they can be resisted or negated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</strong>: Spell-like abilities function just like spells, but are granted through a special racial ability or by a specific class ability (as opposed to spells, which are gained by spellcasting classes as a character gains levels).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Resistance (SR)</strong>: Some creatures are resistant to magic and gain spell resistance. When a creature with spell resistance is targeted by a spell, the caster of the spell must make a caster level check to see if the spell affects the target. The DC of this check is equal to the target creature&rsquo;s SR (some spells do not allow SR checks).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Stacking</strong>: Stacking refers to the act of adding together bonuses or penalties that apply to one particular check or statistic. Generally speaking, most bonuses of the same type do not stack. Instead, only the highest bonus applies. Most penalties do stack, meaning that their values are added together. Penalties and bonuses generally stack with one another, meaning that the penalties might negate or exceed part or all of the bonuses, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Supernatural Abilities (Su)</strong>: Supernatural abilities are magical attacks, defenses, and qualities. These abilities can be always active or they can require a specific action to utilize. The supernatural ability&rsquo;s description includes information on how it is used and its effects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Turn</strong>: In a round, a creature receives one turn, during which it can perform a wide variety of actions. Generally in the course of one turn, a character can perform one standard action, one move action, one swift action, and a number of free actions. Less-common combinations of actions are permissible as well, see Chapter 8 for more details.</p>"}

A character must pay the full cost for scribing each spell scroll no matter how many times she previously has scribed the same spell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The creator must have prepared the spell to be scribed (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) and must provide any material component or focus the spell requires. A material component is consumed when she begins writing, but a focus is not. (A focus used in scribing a scroll can be reused.) The act of writing triggers the prepared spell, making it unavailable for casting until the character has rested and regained spells. (That is, that spell slot is expended from the caster&rsquo;s currently prepared spells, just as if it had been cast.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Scribing a scroll requires 1 day per 1,000 gp of the base price. Although an individual scroll might contain more than one spell, each spell must be scribed as a separate effort, meaning that no more than 1 spell can be scribed in a day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Item Creation Feat Required</h2>\n<p>Scribe Scroll.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Used in Creation</h2>\n<p>Spellcraft, Craft (calligraphy), or Profession (scribe).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Scroll Base Costs (By Scriber's Class)</h2>\n<table style=\"width: 78.7935%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.7186%;\" scope=\"col\">Spell Level</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.6407%;\" scope=\"col\">Cleric, Druid, Wizard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\" scope=\"col\">Sorcerer</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\" scope=\"col\">Bard</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 24.7006%;\" scope=\"col\">Paladin, Ranger*</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.7186%;\">0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.6407%;\">12 gp 5 sp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">12 gp 5 sp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">12 gp 5 sp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 24.7006%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.7186%;\">1st</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.6407%;\">25 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">25 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">25 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 24.7006%;\">25 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.7186%;\">2nd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.6407%;\">150 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">200 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">200 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 24.7006%;\">200 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.7186%;\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.6407%;\">375 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">450 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">525 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 24.7006%;\">525 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.7186%;\">4th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.6407%;\">700 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">800 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">1,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 24.7006%;\">1,000 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.7186%;\">5th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.6407%;\">1,125 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">1,250 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">1,625 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 24.7006%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.7186%;\">6th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.6407%;\">1,650 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">1,800 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">2,400 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 24.7006%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.7186%;\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.6407%;\">2,275 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">2,450 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 24.7006%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.7186%;\">8th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.6407%;\">3,000 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">3,200 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 24.7006%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 15.7186%;\">9th</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 29.6407%;\">3,825 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">4,050 gp</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 14.3713%;\">&mdash;</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 24.7006%;\">&mdash;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>* Caster level is equal to class level &ndash;3.<br />Prices assume that the scroll was made at the minimum caster level.

(That is, those spell slots are expended from the caster&rsquo;s currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Creating some rings may entail other prerequisites beyond or other than spellcasting.

Many PCs are content to live as mercenaries or treasure hunters, no interest in being responsible for the health and well-being of subjects; for these characters, a kingdom is simply a place they pass through on the way to the next adventure. However, characters who are keen to spread their wings and forge a place of power and influence in the world can use this chapter to create a different sort of campaign. If the PCs are interested in ruling only a single town or castle and the small region around it, kingdom building can focus primarily on the settlement and the PCs&rsquo; personal demesne. If the PCs have larger goals, such as carving out a new, independent kingdom, these rules allow them to build cities and engage in trade, diplomacy, and war.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These rules assume that all of the kingdom&rsquo;s leaders are focused on making the kingdom prosperous and stable, rather than oppressing the citizens and stealing from the treasury. Likewise, the rules assume that the leaders are working together, not competing with each other or working at odds. If the campaign begins to step into those areas, the GM is free to introduce new rules to deal with these activities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Like the exploration system, the kingdom-building rules measure terrain in hexes. Each hex is 12 miles from corner to corner, representing an area of just less than 95 square miles. The hex measurement is an abstraction; the hexes are easy to quantify and allow the GM to categorize a large area as one terrain type without having to worry about precise borders of forests and other terrain features.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See <strong>Kingdom Building Rules - GM </strong>and <strong>Kingom Builing Rules - Player</strong> Compendiums:</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.kingdom-building-gm.2ss67fBvXwoLdqgU]{(Index) Kingdom Building - GM}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.kingdom-building-player.Y0OJmV3hlTwQtpIE]{(Index) Kingdom Building - Player}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}

Oracles are chosen without their consent, far-roving rangers pick up magical tricks and traps, druids channel the will of nature, sorcerers get their abilities as dubious presents from philandering ancestors, and bards find magical inspiration in performance and art.

Basic hedge wizards may make a fine living crafting glowing swords, and a priest with the ability to heal broken bones is a must for any church that wants to win itself a congregation, but such everyday spellcasters are hardly the stuff of legend. Instead, those magic users who get remembered as heroes and legends&mdash;rather than simply magical craftsmen and merchants&mdash;take these same techniques and build upon them, seeking out ever-more-elusive knowledge and crafting new spells of magnificent power. It is with these esoteric practices that the greatest make names for themselves; these potent arts set the masters apart from mundane practitioners.</p>"}

It costs 2 squares of movement to move into a square with a shallow bog, and the DC of Acrobatics checks in such a square increases by 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A square that is part of a deep bog has roughly 4 feet of standing water. It costs Medium or larger creatures 4 squares of movement to move into a square with a deep bog, or characters can swim if they wish. Small or smaller creatures must swim to move through a deep bog. Tumbling is impossible in a deep bog.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The water in a deep bog provides cover for Medium or larger creatures. Smaller creatures gain improved cover (+8 bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves). Medium or larger creatures can crouch as a move action to gain this improved cover. Creatures with this improved cover take a &ndash;10 penalty on attacks against creatures that aren&rsquo;t underwater.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Deep bog squares are usually clustered together and surrounded by an irregular ring of shallow bog squares. Both shallow and deep bogs increase the DC of Stealth checks by 2.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Undergrowth</h2>\n<p>The bushes, rushes, and other tall grasses in marshes function as undergrowth does in a forest. A square that is part of a bog does not also have undergrowth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Quicksand</h2>\n<p>Patches of quicksand present a deceptively solid appearance (appearing as undergrowth or open land) that might trap careless characters. A character approaching a patch of quicksand at a normal pace is entitled to a DC 15 Survival check to spot the danger before stepping in, but charging or running characters don&rsquo;t have a chance to detect a hidden patch before blundering into it. A typical patch of quicksand is 20 feet in diameter; the momentum of a charging or running character carries him 1d2 &times; 5 feet into the quicksand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Effects of Quicksand</h2>\n<p>Characters in quicksand must make a DC 10 Swim check every round to simply tread water in place, or a DC 15 Swim check to move 5 feet in whatever direction is desired. If a trapped character fails this check by 5 or more, he sinks below the surface and begins to drown whenever he can no longer hold his breath (see the @Compendium[pf1.skills.weCPHUuXi9sF5r4E]{Swim} skill ).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Characters below the surface of quicksand may swim back to the surface with a successful Swim check (DC 15, +1 per consecutive round of being under the surface).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Rescue</h2>\n<p>Pulling out a character trapped in quicksand can be difficult. A rescuer needs a branch, spear haft, rope, or similar tool that enables him to reach the victim with one end of it. Then he must make a DC 15 Strength check to successfully pull the victim, and the victim must make a DC 10 Strength check to hold onto the branch, pole, or rope. If both checks succeed, the victim is pulled 5 feet closer to safety. If the victim fails to hold on, he must make a DC 15 Swim check immediately to stay above the surface.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Hedgerows</h2>\n<p>Common in moors, hedgerows are tangles of stones, soil, and thorny bushes. Narrow hedgerows function as low walls, and it takes 3 squares of movement to cross them. Wide hedgerows are more than 5 feet tall and take up entire squares. They provide total cover, just as a wall does. It takes 4 squares of movement to move through a square with a wide hedgerow; creatures that succeed on a DC 10 Climb check need only 2 squares of movement to move through the square.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Other Marsh Terrain Elements</h2>\n<p>Some marshes, particularly swamps, have trees just as forests do, usually clustered in small stands. Paths lead across many marshes, winding to avoid bog areas. As in forests, paths allow normal movement and don&rsquo;t provide the concealment that undergrowth does.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Stealth and Detection in a Marsh</h2>\n<p>In a marsh, the maximum distance at which a Perception check for detecting the nearby presence of others can succeed is 6d6 &times; 10 feet. In a swamp, this distance is 2d8 &times; 10 feet. Undergrowth and deep bogs provide plentiful concealment, so it&rsquo;s easy to use Stealth in a marsh.</p>"}

Unless your character is weak or carrying a lot of gear, that&rsquo;s all you need to know; the extra gear your character carries won&rsquo;t slow him down any more than the armor already does.</p>\n<p>If your character is weak or carrying a lot of gear, however, then you&rsquo;ll need to calculate encumbrance by weight. Doing so is most important when your character is trying to carry some heavy object.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Encumbrance by Weight</strong>: If you want to determine whether your character&rsquo;s gear is heavy enough to slow him down more than his armor already does, total the weight of all the character&rsquo;s items, including armor, weapons, and gear (see appropriate tables in Chapter 6). Compare this total to the character&rsquo;s Strength on Table 7&ndash;4. Depending on the character&rsquo;s carrying capacity, he or she may be carrying a light, medium, or heavy load. Like armor, a character&rsquo;s load affects his maximum Dexterity bonus to AC, carries a check penalty (which works like an armor check penalty), reduces the character&rsquo;s speed, and affects how fast the character can run, as shown on Table 7&ndash;5. A medium or heavy load counts as medium or heavy armor for the purpose of abilities or skills that are restricted by armor. Carrying a light load does not encumber a character.</p>\n<p>If your character is wearing armor, use the worse figure (from armor or from load) for each category. Do not stack the penalties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Lifting and Dragging</strong>: A character can lift as much as his maximum load over his head. A character&rsquo;s maximum load is the highest amount of weight listed for a character&rsquo;s Strength in the heavy load column of Table 7&ndash;4.</p>\n<p>A character can lift as much as double his maximum load off the ground, but he or she can only stagger around with it. While overloaded in this way, the character loses any Dexterity bonus to AC and can move only 5 feet per round (as a full-round action).</p>\n<p>A character can generally push or drag along the ground as much as five times his maximum load. Favorable conditions can double these numbers, and bad circumstances can reduce them by half or more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Bigger and Smaller Creatures</strong>: The figures on Table 7&ndash;4 are for Medium bipedal creatures. A larger bipedal creature can carry more weight depending on its size category, as follows: Large &times;2, Huge &times;4, Gargantuan &times;8, Colossal &times;16. A smaller creature can carry less weight depending on its size category, as follows: Small &times;3/4, Tiny &times;1/2, Diminutive &times;1/4, Fine &times;1/8.</p>\n<p>Quadrupeds can carry heavier loads than bipeds can. Multiply the values corresponding to the creature&rsquo;s Strength score from Table 7&ndash;4 by the appropriate modifier, as follows: Fine &times;1/4, Diminutive &times;1/2, Tiny &times;3/4, Small &times;1, Medium &times;1-1/2, Large &times;3, Huge &times;6, Gargantuan &times;12, Colossal &times;24.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Tremendous Strength</strong>: For Strength scores not shown on Table 7&ndash;4, find the Strength score between 20 and 29 that has the same number in the &ldquo;ones&rdquo; digit as the creature&rsquo;s Strength score does and multiply the numbers in that row by 4 for every 10 points the creature&rsquo;s Strength is above the score for that row.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Table 7-4: Carrying Capacity</h2>\n<table style=\"height: 496px;

Designing Spells}</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Source</strong> <em>Ultimate Magic pg. 129</em></p>\n<p>The simplest spells only affect one target, whether that target is a creature, an object, or just the caster. Technically, a spell that only affects the caster (with a range of &ldquo;personal&rdquo; and target of &ldquo;you&rdquo;) is slightly weaker than one with a target of &ldquo;one creature,&rdquo; because being able to cast the spell on anyone makes it more versatile and thus more powerful. However, the slight decrease in power from making a spell &ldquo;caster-only&rdquo; should not be used to justify designing the spell at a lower level. In most cases, the caster-only spells are designed that way either because they&rsquo;ve always worked that way, or because they provide a bonus that is unique and advantageous for that class, but that could get out of hand if you allowed anyone to get the benefit of the spell by casting it on them or drinking a potion of that spell; these spells should remain caster-only, but you should examine their power level as if you could cast them on anyone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Example: Shield and true strike are both 1st-level spells that only affect the caster. If you could cast those spells on others, they&rsquo;d still be at the right power level for 1st-level spells&mdash;they aren&rsquo;t 2nd-level spells that you knocked down a level because you designed them as caster-only. Shield has always been a spell that only affects the caster, and there&rsquo;s a game-balance reason to keep it that way: because shield grants a shield bonus, casting it on a melee character means the fighter could drop his actual shield and start wielding his weapon two-handed for extra damage. True strike was deliberately designed as a caster-only spell so a sorcerer couldn&rsquo;t just cast it every round on the fighter, who&rsquo;d be guaranteed a hit against a difficult monster even if he used Combat Expertise (for extra AC) and Power Attack (for extra damage). Making those spells caster-only doesn&rsquo;t really weaken the spells, but it does prevent players from exploiting certain combinations that would make encounters too easy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A spell that affects multiple creatures is more powerful than a spell that only affects one creature. Multiple-creature spells tend to either be area effects such as cones and spheres (like fireball), or allow the caster to select multiple targets as long as no two targets are more than a set distance apart (like slow). A burst effect like fireball can potentially affect many more enemies than a pick-your- targets spell like slow, but you never risk hitting your friends when you use slow. Select which type is most appropriate for the spell, but understand that selecting multiple targets is generally more powerful except at the lowest caster levels (where a low caster level means few targets compared to a burst which can affect many).</p>"}
