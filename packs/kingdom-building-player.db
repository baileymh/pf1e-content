{"_id":"DIz5OOZlyksXYEeS","name":"2.2.1. Leadership Roles","flags":{"importid":"twqC1Gftijwh5gbG"},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A stable kingdom has leaders that fill different roles - tending to the economy, defense, and health of its citizens. PCs and NPCs can fill these roles; your fighter may be the kingdom's Warden, the party cleric its High Priest, and so on. Each role grants the kingdom different benefits.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>A character can only fill one leadership role at a time. For example, your character can't be both the Ruler and the High Priest. Even if you want the Ruler to be the head of the kingdom's religion, she's too busy ruling to also do the work of a High Priest; she'll have to appoint someone else to do that work.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The kingdom must have someone in the Ruler role to function; without a Ruler, the kingdom cannot perform basic actions and gains Unrest every turn. All other roles are optional, though leaving certain roles vacant gives your kingdom penalties. These leadership roles can be a part of any form of government; in some kingdoms they take the form of a formal ruling council, while in others they may be advisors, ministers, relatives of the leader, or simply powerful nobles, merchants, or bureaucrats with access to the seat of power. The names of these roles are game terms and need not correspond to the titles of those roles in the kingdom - the Ruler of your kingdom may be called king, queen, chosen one, padishah, overlord, sultan, and so on.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Responsibilities of Leadership: </b>In order to gain the benefits of leadership, you must spend at least 7 days per month attending to your duties; these days need not be consecutive. This can be roleplayed or can be assumed to run in the background without needing to be defined or actively played out. Time spent ruling cannot be used for adventuring, crafting magic items, or completing other downtime activities (see Chapter 2) that require your full attention and participation. Failure to complete your duties during a turn means treating the role as thought it's vacant.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For most campaigns, it's best to have the PCs pick the same days of the month for these administrative duties, so everyone is available for adventuring at the same time.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>PCs and NPCs as Leaders: </b>These rules include enough important leadership roles that a small group of PCs can't fill them all. You may have to recruit NPCs to fill out the remaining necessary roles for your kingdom. Cohorts, followers, and even intelligent familiars or similar companions can fill leadership roles, and you may want to consider inviting allied NPCs to become rulers, such as asking a friendly ranger you rescued to become the kingdom's Marshal.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Abdicating a Role: </b>If you want to step down from a leadership position, you must find a replacement to avoid incurring the appropriate vacancy penalty for your position. Abdicating a position increases Unrest and requires a Loyalty check; if the check fails, the vacancy penalty applies for 1 turn while the new leader transitions into that role. If you are the Ruler, abdicating increases Unrest by a higher amount, and you take a -4 penalty on the Loyalty check to avoid the vacancy penalty.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you are not the Ruler and are leaving one leadership role to take a different one in the kingdom, the Unrest increase does not occur and you gain a +4 bonus on the Loyalty check to avoid the vacancy penalty.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Leader Statistics : </b>The statistics for the different roles are presented as follows.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>This explains the benefit to your kingdom if you have a character in this role. If you have the Leadership feat, increase this benefit by 1. If this section gives you a choice of two ability scores, use whichever is highest.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Most benefits are constant and last as long as there is a character in that role, but don't stack with themselves. If a benefit mentions a particular phase in kingdom building, that benefit applies every turn during that phase. For example, the Royal Enforcer decreases Unrest by 1 at every Upkeep phase.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty: </b>This line explains the penalty to your kingdom if no character fills this role, or if the leader fails to spend the necessary time fulfilling his responsibilities. Some roles have no vacancy penalty. If a character in a role is killed or permanently incapacitated during a turn and not restored to health by the start of the next kingdom turn, that role counts as vacant for that next turn, after which a replacement can be appointed to the role.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Like benefits, most vacancy penalties are constant, last as long as that role is vacant, and don't stack with themselves. If a vacant role lists an increase to Unrest, however, that increase does not go away when the role is filled.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Who Rolls the Kingdom Check?</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Running a kingdom is more fun if all the players are involved and each is responsible for making some of the kingdom checks. Who makes each roll depends on the players in your group and what roles they want to play. Some players may not want to make any of these rolls. You may want to start with the following die roll responsibilities and modify them to suit your kingdom and the other players.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Ruler: </b>Loyalty checks, any checks or edicts not covered by other rulers</p>\n          <p><b>Consort </b>: As Ruler when Ruler is unavailable</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Councilor: </b>Holiday edicts</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>General: </b>Kingdom checks for events requiring combat</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Grand Diplomat: </b>Diplomatic edicts (optional rule)</p>\n          <p><b>Heir </b>: As Ruler when Ruler is unavailable</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>High Priest: </b>Holiday edicts, rolls to generate magic items from Cathedrals, Shrines, and Temples</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Magister: </b>Rolls to generate magic items not rolled by the High Priest</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Marshal: </b>Exploration edicts (optional rule)</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Royal Enforcer: </b>Loyalty checks to reduce Unrest or prevent Unrest increases</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Spymaster: </b>Kingdom checks involving crime and foreigners</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Treasurer: </b>Economy checks, Taxation edicts</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Warden </b>: Stability checks</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Ruler</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Ruler is the highest-ranking person in the kingdom, above even the other kingdom leaders, and is expected to embody the values of the kingdom. The Ruler performs the kingdom's most important ceremonies (such as knighting royals and signing treaties), is the kingdom's chief diplomatic officer (though most of these duties are handled by the Grand Diplomat), is the signatory for all laws affecting the entire kingdom, pardons criminals when appropriate, and is responsible for appointing characters to all other high positions in the government (such as other leadership roles, mayors of settlements, and judges).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>Choose one kingdom attribute (Economy, Loyalty, or Stability). Add your Charisma modifier to this attribute.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If your kingdom's Size is 26-100, choose a second kingdom attribute and add your Charisma modifier to it as well.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If your kingdom's Size is 101 or more, choose a third kingdom attribute and add your Charisma modifier to it too.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you have the Leadership feat, the bonus from the feat applies to all kingdom attributes you affect (one, two, or three attributes, depending on the kingdom's Size). If you marry someone of equal station, you both can act as Ruler. You both add your Charisma modifiers to the kingdom attribute (or attributes, if the kingdom is large enough). As long as one of you is present for 1 week per month, you avoid the vacancy penalty. In a typical campaign where the kingdom leaders have no ties to actual nobility, \"someone of equal station\" is irrelevant and your marriage is between two Rulers. In a campaign where the leaders are nobles or royals, marrying someone of lesser station means the spouse becomes a Consort rather than a Ruler</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty: </b>A kingdom without a ruler cannot claim new hexes, create Farms, build Roads, or purchase settlement districts. Unrest increases during the kingdom's Upkeep phase.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Special: </b>Two characters can fill this role if they become married, in which case the two rulers can jointly command the kingdom. Both rulers apply their Charisma modifiers to the kingdom's Stability, Economy, and Loyalty checks as appropriate for their rank, and as long as one of the two rulers is present for 1 week per month, they avoid the vacancy penalty.</p>\n          <h1>Consort</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Consort is usually the spouse of the Ruler, and spends time attending court, speaking with and advising nobles, touring the kingdom to lift the spirits of the people, and so on. In most kingdoms, you cannot have two married Rulers and a Consort at the same time.</p>\n          <p>The Consort represents the Ruler when the Ruler is occupied or otherwise unable to act. With the Ruler's permission, the Consort may perform any of the Ruler's duties, allowing the Ruler to effectively act in two places at once. If the Ruler dies, the Consort may act as Ruler until the Heir comes of age and can take over as Ruler.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>Add half your Charisma modifier to Loyalty. If the ruler is unavailable during a turn, you may act as the Ruler for that turn, negating the vacancy penalty for having no Ruler, though you do not gain the Ruler benefit. If you act as the Ruler for the turn, you must succeed at a Loyalty check during the kingdom's Upkeep phase or Unrest increases by 1.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty: </b>None</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Councilor</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Councilor acts as a liaison between the citizenry and the other kingdom leaders, parsing requests from the commonwealth and presenting the leaders' proclamations to the people in understandable ways. It is the Councilor's responsibility to make sure the Ruler is making decisions that benefit the kingdom's communities and its citizens.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>Add your Charisma modifier or Wisdom modifier to Loyalty.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty: </b>The kingdom gains no benefits from the Holiday edict. During the Upkeep phase, Unrest increases.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>General</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The General is the highest-ranking member of the kingdom's military. If the kingdom has an army and a navy, the heads of those organizations report to the kingdom's General. The General is responsible for looking after the needs of the military and directing the kingdom's armies in times of war. Most citizens see the General as a protector and patriot.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>Add your Charisma modifier or Strength modifier to Stability.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty: </b>Loyalty decreases.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Grand Diplomat</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Grand Diplomat is in charge of the kingdom's foreign policy - how it interacts with other kingdoms and similar political organizations such as tribes of intelligent monsters. The Grand Diplomat is the head of all of the kingdom's diplomats, envoys, and ambassadors. It is the Grand Diplomat's responsibility to represent and protect the interests of the kingdom with regard to foreign powers.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>Add your Charisma modifier or Intelligence modifier to Stability.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty: </b>Stability decreases. The kingdom cannot issue Diplomatic or Exploration edicts.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Heir</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Heir is usually the Ruler's eldest son or daughter, though some kingdoms may designate a significant advisor (such as a seneschal) as Heir. The Heir's time is mostly spent learning to become a ruler-pursuing academic and martial training, touring the kingdom to get to the know the land and its people, experiencing the intrigues of courtly life, and so on.</p>\n          <p>Because the Heir carries the potential of being the next Ruler, the Heir's role is similar to the Consort in that the Heir may act on behalf of the Ruler.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>Add half your Charisma modifier to Loyalty. You may act as the Ruler for a turn, negating the vacancy penalty for the kingdom having no Ruler, though you do not gain the Ruler benefit. Whenever you act as the Ruler for the turn, you must succeed at a Loyalty check during the kingdom's Upkeep phase or Unrest increases by 1.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty: </b>None</p>\n          <h1>High Priest</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The High Priest tends to the kingdom's religious needs and guides its growth. If the kingdom has an official religion, the High Priest may also be the highest ranking member of that religion in the kingdom, and has similar responsibilities over the lesser priests of that faith to those the Grand Diplomat has over the kingdom's ambassadors and diplomats. If the kingdom has no official religion, the High Priest may be a representative of the most popular religion in the kingdom or a neutral party representing the interests of all religions allowed by the kingdom.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>Add your Charisma modifier or Wisdom modifier to Stability</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty: </b>Stability and Loyalty decrease. During the Upkeep phase, Unrest increases.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Magister</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Magister guides the kingdom's higher learning and magic, promoting education and knowledge among the citizens and representing the interests of magic, science, and academia. In most kingdoms, the Magister is a sage, a wizard, or a priest of a deity of knowledge, and oversees the governmental bureaucracy except regarding finance.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>Add your Charisma modifier or Intelligence modifier to Economy</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty: </b>Economy decreases.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Marshal</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Marshal ensures that the kingdom's laws are being enforced in the remote parts of the kingdom as well as in the vicinity of the capital. The Marshal is also responsible for securing the kingdom's borders. He organizes regular patrols and works with the General to respond to threats that militias and adventurers can't deal with alone.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit </b>: Add your Dexterity modifier or Wisdom modifier to Economy.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty </b>: Economy decreases.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Royal Enforcer</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Royal Enforcer deals with punishing criminals, working with the Councilor to make sure the citizens feel the government is adequately dealing with wrongdoers, and working with the Marshal to capture fugitives from the law. The Royal Enforcer may grant civilians the authority to kill in the name of the law.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>Add your Dexterity modifier or Strength modifier to Loyalty. During the Upkeep phase, you may decrease Unrest by 1 (this is not affected by having the Leadership feat); if you do so, you must succeed at a Loyalty check or Loyalty decreases.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty: </b>None</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Spymaster</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Spymaster observes the kingdom's criminal elements and underworld and spies on other kingdoms. The Spymaster always has a finger on the pulse of the kingdom's underbelly, and uses acquired information to protect the interests of the kingdom at home and elsewhere through a network of spies and informants.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>During the Edict phase, choose one kingdom attribute (Economy, Loyalty or Stability). Add your Dexterity modifier or Intelligence modifier to this attribute.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty: </b>Economy decreases. During the Upkeep phase, Unrest increases.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Treasurer</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Treasurer monitors the state of the kingdom's Treasury and citizens' confidence in the value of their money and investigates whether any businesses are taking unfair advantage of the system. The Treasurer is in charge of the tax collectors and tracks debts and credits with guilds and other governments.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>Add your Intelligence modifier or Wisdom modifier to Economy.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty </b>: Economy decreases. The kingdom cannot collect taxes - during the Edict phase, when you would normally collect taxes, the kingdom does not collect taxes at all and the taxation level is considered \"none.\".</p>\n          <h1>Viceroy</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Viceroy represents the Ruler's interests on an ongoing basis in a specific location such as a colony or vassal state. The Viceroy is in effect the Ruler for that territory; her orders are superceded only by direct commands from the Ruler.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>Add half your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier to Economy. You may assume any leadership role (including Ruler) for your colony or vassal state, but any benefit you provide in this role is 1 less than normal; if you do so, you must spend 7 days that month performing duties appropriate to that leadership role in addition to the 7 days spent for Viceroy duties.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty: </b>If you have no Viceroy for your vassal state, treat it as if it had the Ruler vacancy penalty.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Warden</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The Warden is responsible for enforcing laws in larger settlements, as well as ensuring the safety of the kingdom leaders. The Warden also works with the General to deploy forces to protect settlements and react to internal threats. The warden leads the city guards.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Benefit: </b>Add your Constitution modifier or Strength modifier to Loyalty.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Vacancy Penalty: </b>Loyalty and Stability decrease.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</text>\n\t\t\t"}
{"_id":"DnXdqwS9SPbD2zUW","name":"3. Settlements and Districts","flags":{"importid":"eq1HzFOV7TkmRCfm"},"content":"<p>The greatest assets of your kingdom are its settlements. Most settlements start as simple villages, and some grow over time into bustling cities.</p>\n<p>You can use the District Grid to create the initial design for your settlement and decide where to place additional buildings as it grows.</p>\n<p>The District Grid is divided into 9 large blocks separated by streets. Each block consists of 4 smaller lots separated by alleys. Treat each lot as approximately 750 feet per side, so overall the district takes up about 1 square mile. On each lot you may construct a building, and each building affects your kingdom's Economy, Loyalty, and so on. Descriptions of these buildings, as well as the bonuses they provide once they're added to a settlement, are in the 'Building Types' section.</p>\n<p>Most settlements only have 1 district. If your District Grid is full and you want to add another district (for example, if you run out of available lots in that settlement and want to construct additional buildings), you can create an additional district for that settlement by paying the preparation cost for the settlement's terrain as listed on Terrain and Terrain Costs (see below). Remember that your kingdom's Control DC is based on the number of districts in your settlement.</p>\n<p>Icons representing each of the building types are included as tokens. You can attach them to your District Grid as your settlement grows.</p>\n<p>The placement of buildings in your district is up to you - you can start in the center of the district and build outward, or start at the edge and build toward the center. Some buildings (such as the Guildhall) take up more than 1 lot on the grid. You can't divide up these larger structures, though you can place them so they cover a street. (Streets do not count as lots.)</p>\n<p><strong>Construction: </strong>Construction is completed in the same turn you spend BP for the building, no matter what its size is. A building's benefits apply to your kingdom immediately. At the GM's discretion, construction magic (such as lyre of building, fabricate, or wall of stone) can reduce a single building's BP cost by 2 (minimum 0). This is a one-time reduction per turn, regardless of the amount of magic used.</p>\n<p><strong>Population: </strong>A settlement's population is approximately equal to the number of completed lots within its districts &times; 250. A grid that has all 36 lots filled with buildings has a population of approximately 9,000.</p>\n<p><strong>Base Value: </strong>The base value of a settlement is used to determine what magic items may easily be purchased there. There is a 75% chance that any item of that value or lower can be found for sale in the settlement with little effort. The base value of a new settlement is 0 gp. Certain buildings (such as a Market or Tavern) increase a settlement's base value. A settlement's base value can never increase above the values listed below in Table: Settlement Size and Base Value (except under special circumstances decided by the GM).</p>\n<p><strong>Defense: </strong>A settlement's Defense is used with the mass combat rules. It otherwise has no effect unless the settlement is attacked. You can increase a settlement's Defense by building certain structures (such as City Walls).</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.kingdom-building-scenes.qYQrLDT1grPCWKqv]{District Grid}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.kingdom-building-player.EInHlfC0fnYUHhEc]{4.2.

An improvement marked with an asterisk (*) can share the same hex as other improvements.</p>\n<p>Some terrain improvements affect a settlement's Defense, which is used in the mass combat rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain: </strong>This indicates what kind of hex you can build this terrain improvement in.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect: </strong>This line states the effect the terrain improvement has on that hex (or in some cases, your entire kingdom).</p>\n<p>If an improvement says you can upgrade it into another improvement, you can do so by paying the cost difference between the two improvements. When the upgrade is complete, you lose the benefit of the old improvement but gain the benefit of the new improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>This line gives the cost in BP to build the terrain improvement.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.kingdom-building-player.JWKZgqSZ2jmSEpxQ]{2.2.2.1. Terrain and Terrain Costs}</p>\n<h1>Aqueduct*</h1>\n<p>An Aqueduct brings water from alpine lakes and rivers to lowland cities where water is scarce or insufficient for the local populace. A finished series of Aqueduct hexes must connect to a hill or mountain hex (with a river or lake) on one end and a settlement on the other end; otherwise, you do not gain its benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain: </strong>One end must be hill or mountain hex; can pass through any type of hex.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect: </strong>Loyalty and Stability increases. Allows settlement to build water-dependent buildings.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>As a Road, except the cost is not doubled for hexes with rivers (see Terrain and Terrain Costs above).</p>\n<h1>Bridge*</h1>\n<p>A Bridge allows your Road hexes to cross rivers.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>When you build a Road in a hex that contains a river, the doubled coast of the Road includes the cost of bridges needed to cross the river. You don't need to build a Bridge as a separate unit; it's listed here for reference only.</p>\n<h1>Canal*</h1>\n<p>A Canal is an artificial waterway that allows barge traffic to haul heavy commodities. Terrain: Desert, hill, or plain.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect: </strong>Settlements in a hex with a Canal treat the hex as if it had a river. Cost: Twice the cost of a Road (see Terrain and Terrain Costs above).</p>\n<h1>Farm*</h1>\n<p>A Farm helps feed your kingdom. Terrain: Desert (requires canal, coastline, or river), hill, or plain.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect: </strong>Consumption decreases.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>See Terrain and Terrain Costs above.</p>\n<h1>Fishery*</h1>\n<p>A Fishery is like a Farm, except it provides abundant fish rather than planted crops.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain: </strong>Coastline, water, river, or marsh.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect: </strong>Consumption decreases.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>???.</p>\n<h1>Fort*</h1>\n<p>A Fort is a walled encampment for military forces outside a settlement. You can upgrade a Watchtower to a Fort (Unrest decreases when you do so, just as if you had built the Fort from scratch).</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain: </strong>Any land.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect: </strong>Stability and Defense increase; Consumption increases; Unrest decreases when completed. If this hex becomes a settlement, this improvement counts as one Barracks and one Stables building.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>???.</p>\n<h1>Highway*</h1>\n<p>A highway is a paved and well-maintained version of a Road. You may upgrade a Road into a Highway. You must have a kingdom of Size 26 or greater to build a Highway.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain: </strong>Any hex with a Road.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect: </strong>Economy and Stability increase based on the number of hexes of Highway; improves overland travel speed (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 172).</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>Twice the cost of a Road (see Terrain and Terrain Costs above).</p>\n<h1>Mine</h1>\n<p>A Mine extracts metal, coal, salt, or other useful materials from the earth.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain: </strong>Cavern, desert, hill, or mountain.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect: </strong>Economy increases, earn additional BP per turn when collecting taxes during the Income phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>???.</p>\n<h1>Quarry</h1>\n<p>A Quarry extracts workable stone from the ground.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain: </strong>Cavern, hill, or mountain.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect: </strong>Stability increase, earn additional BP per turn when collecting taxes during the Income phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>???.</p>\n<h1>Road*</h1>\n<p>A Road speeds travel through your kingdom and promotes trade. You can upgrade a Road to a Highway.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain </strong>: Any land.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect </strong>: Economy and Stability increase based on the number of hexes of Road; improves overland travel speed (Core Rulebook 172).</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>See the Road column of Terrain and Terrain Costs.</p>\n<h1>Sawmill</h1>\n<p>A sawmill centralizes the activities of loggers and turns trees into lumber for use in building and crafting.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain: </strong>Forest or jungle.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect: </strong>Stability increases, earn additional BP per turn when collecting taxes during the Income phase.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: </strong>???.</p>\n<h1>Watchtower*</h1>\n<p>A Watchtower flies your flag, is a safe place for your patrols, and establishes your power on the frontier. A Watchtower cannot share a hex with a Fort or another Watchtower.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrain: </strong>Any land.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect: </strong>Stability +1 and Defense increase; Unrest decreases when completed. If this hex becomes a settlement, this improvement counts as a Watchtower building.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost: ??? </strong>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Special Terrain</h1>\n<p>Some hexes contain features or resources that impact a kingdom's Economy, Loyalty, Stability, and other game statistics. These terrain resources are placed by the GM - not by player characters - for you to discover while exploring or adventuring, and may modify terrain improvements or cities.</p>\n<p><strong>Bridge: </strong>The hex contains an existing Bridge over a waterway. If you build a Road in this hex, you do not have to double the cost of the Road.</p>\n<p><strong>Building: </strong>The hex contains an abandoned building in good repair (type determined by the GM). If you establish a settlement at the building's location in the hex, you can incorporate the building into the settlement at no cost (this does not count toward your building limit for that turn).</p>\n<p><strong>Free City: </strong>A Free City is a settlement that is not part of any established kingdom. Claiming a hex with a Free City is an excellent way to add a fully functional settlement to your kingdom. In order to claim a Free City hex peacefully, you must succeed at a Stability check. Failure indicates radicals and upstarts in the settlement and Unrest increases.</p>\n<p><strong>Lair: </strong>A Lair is usually a cave or defensible shelter that can be used as a defensive fallback point, a storage location, or even a guardpost or prison. If you claim a hex with a Lair, Stability increases. If you construct a Fort or Watchtower over a Lair, its Defense increases. At the GM's option, a Lair may allow access to an underground cavern hex (see Terrain and Terrain Costss).</p>\n<p><strong>Landmark: </strong>A Landmark is a site of great pride, mystery, and wonder, such as an outcropping in the shape of a human face, a smoking volcano, or a lake with an unusual color or unique properties. The Landmark bolsters your kingdom's morale. If you claim a hex with a Landmark, Loyalty increases. If the hex also has a Road or Highway, Loyalty increases further.</p>\n<p><strong>Resource: </strong>A Resource is a ready supply of some kind of valuable commodity that offers a great economic boon to your kingdom, such as exotic lumber, precious metal, gems, rare herbs, incense, silk, ivory, furs, salt, dyes, and the like. If you claim a hex with a Resource, Economy increases. If you construct a Mine, Quarry, or Sawmill in a hex with a Resource, all of its benefits increase further. If you construct a Farm or Fishery in a hex with a Resource, those improvements decrease Consumption further.</p>\n<p><strong>River: </strong>A River allows water travel through your kingdom (Core Rulebook 172), facilitating trade and allowing irrigation. Economy increases by 1 for every 4 River hexes claimed, and Stability increases by 1 for every 8 such hexes claimed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Ruin:</strong> A Ruin is a partially destroyed building. If you claim a hex containing a Ruin and build a settlement at the Ruin's location, you can use the Ruin as the basis of an appropriate type of building (as determined by the GM), reducing the cost of that building significantly. Alternatively, you can salvage building materials from the Ruin, reducing the cost of 1 building in that hex by some amount of BP.</p>"}
{"_id":"IF2HUfbn7Z839KQh","name":"2.2.3. Edicts","flags":{"importid":"0PQn1UomayB7iXTI"},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Edicts are the official pronouncements by your government about how you are running the kingdom that turn. For example, you may decide to have low or high taxes, to have more or fewer holidays, and how much effort to put into improving the kingdom's infrastructure. Edicts fall into four types: Holiday, Improvement, Promotion, and Taxation.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In the Edict phase of the kingdom turn, you may set the Holiday, Promotion, and Taxation edict categories to whatever level you want, as well as decide how much of your allowed improvement from the Improvement edict you'll use. For example, you may decide that this turn holidays are quarterly, promotions are aggressive, taxation is minimal, and you won't build any improvements.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Improvement Edicts</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Improvements are physical improvements you can make to your kingdom: founding new settlements, adding buildings to a settlement, building roads, creating facilities such as mines to tap natural resources, and claiming more hexes for your kingdom. Your kingdom's Size limits how many improvements you can make each turn; see Table: Improvement Edicts. You can make all of the improvements listed on the appropriate row of the table. For example, if your kingdom's Size is 5, on each turn you can create 1 new settlement, 1 new building, 2 terrain improvements, and claim 1 more hex.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Note: Improvement Edicts are detailed in greater depth in Steps 2, 3 and 4 of the Edict Phase.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Holiday Edicts</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Holidays are general celebrations or observances that take place across the kingdom. The BP expenditure includes lost revenue from citizens not working during the holidays, preparations and logistical arrangements that occur year round, and the cost of the actual celebrations (these annual costs are averaged over the year and included in the listed Consumption modifier that you pay each turn).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The number of holidays per year is the number you promise to uphold and the number that the common folk expect to enjoy over the next months. The Loyalty and Consumption modifiers change as soon as you change the number of holidays per year. The listed number assumes that you are fulfilling your promise - if you announce 12 holidays in the coming year but don't actually hold and pay for them, the GM should increase your kingdom's Unrest to reflect public disappointment and outrage.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Example: </b>Logan is the Ruler of a kingdom with some Loyalty issues. He issues a Holiday edict that there will be 24 kingdom-wide official holidays in the next year. In the second turn, he worries about the increased Consumption's effect on the Treasury, so he issues a new Holiday edict decreeing that until further notice, there will be no kingdom-wide holidays. He loses the previous Loyalty bonus and incurs a Loyalty penalty for the new Holiday edict, but no longer has to pay the Consumption each turn for his previous edict. If he frequently changes Holiday edicts from high to low levels, the GM may decide that his citizens no longer believe such promises and he won't gain any benefits from having a high level of Holiday edict until he becomes consistent.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Promotion Edicts</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Promotion edicts are events and actions the kingdom uses to attract new citizens and increase the well-being of the kingdom, such as recruitment campaigns, advertisements about services and goods, and propaganda to improve the perception of your kingdom at home and abroad. Promotions increase Consumption, but also increase Stability.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Taxation Edicts</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Setting the tax level determines how much revenue you collect from taxes in the Income phase. Higher taxes increase your kingdom's Economy (making it easier for you to succeed at Economy checks to generate revenue) but make your citizens unhappy (reducing Loyalty).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Table: Holiday Edicts</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Per Year</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Loyalty</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Consumption</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>None</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>1</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>6</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>12</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>24</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Table: Promotion Edicts</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Promotion Level</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Stability</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Consumption</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>None</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Token</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Standard</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Aggressive</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Expansionist</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</table>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h1>Table: Taxation Edicts</h1>\n\t\t\t\t\t<table>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Tax Level</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Economy</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td><b>Loyalty</b></td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>None</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Light</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Normal</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Heavy</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>Overwhelming</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<td>?</td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t</table>\n\t\t\t\t</text>\n\t\t\t"}

Income Phase","flags":{"importid":"nEuj60R0h5NhXDRS"},"content":"<p>During the Income phase, you may add to or withdraw from the Treasury as well as collect taxes.</p>\n<h1>Step 1 - Make Withdrawals from the treasury</h1>\n<p>The kingdom-building rules allow you to expend BP on things related to running the kingdom. If you want to spend some of the kingdom's resources on something for your own personal benefit (such as a new magic item), you may withdraw BP from the Treasury and convert it into gp once per turn, but there is a penalty for doing so.</p>\n<p>Each time you withdraw BP for your personal use, Unrest increases by the number of BP withdrawn.

For every full 4,000 gp in value of the deposit, increase your kingdom's BP by 1.</p>\n<p>If you want to donate an item that is worth more than 4,000 gp, refer to Step 3 instead</p>\n<h1>Step 3 - Sell expensive items for bp</h1>\n<p>You can attempt to sell expensive personal items (that is, items worth more than 4,000 gp each) through your kingdom's markets to add to your Treasury. You may sell one item per settlement district per turn.

{"_id":"WOnvK7WUCQTgTiex","name":"3.1. Founding A Settlement","flags":{"importid":"o0IaRVBNRAuoFCdR"},"content":"<p>Before you can start your own kingdom, you first need a base of operations - a fort, village, or other settlement - where you can rest between adventures and where your citizens know they can find you if they need help or want to pay their taxes. Once you have a kingdom, you'll want to create more settlements in order for the kingdom to grow and prosper. To found a settlement, you must perform the following steps. (These steps assume you're building a new settlement from scratch; if you're attempting to incorporate an existing settlement into your kingdom, see Free City Terrain Improvement.)</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1 </strong>- Acquire funds. You'll need money and resources in the form of build points.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2 </strong>- Explore and clear a hex . You'll need to explore the hex where you want to put the settlement. See the Exploration Time column on Terrain and Terrain Costs (see below) to see how long this takes. Once you have explored the hex, clear it of monsters and dangerous hazards. The time needed to clear it depends on the nature of the threats; this step is usually handled by you completing adventures there to kill or drive out monsters.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3 </strong>- Claim the hex as yours. Once you have BP and have explored and cleared the hex, you can claim it. Spend 1 BP to do so; this represents setting up very basic infrastructure such as clearing paths, hiring patrols, setting up a tent city, and so on. This establishes the hex as part of your kingdom (or the beginning of your kingdom).</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4 </strong>- Prepare the site for construction . To put a settlement on a claimed hex, you'll need to prepare it. Depending on the site, this process may involve clearing trees, moving boulders, digging sanitation trenches, and so on. See the Preparation Cost column on Terrain and Terrain Costs (see below) for the BP cost. If your settlement is in a hex containing a canal, lake, ocean, river, or similar large body of water, you must decide which of your settlement's borders are water (riverbanks, lakeshores, or seashores) or land. Some types of buildings, such as Mills, Piers, and Waterfronts, must be adjacent to water.</p>\n<p>A new settlement consists of 1 district, represented by the District Grid map. Mark the four borders on the District Grid as land or water, as appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5 </strong>- Construct your first buildings . Construct 1 building in your settlement and pay its BP cost. If this is your kingdom's first settlement, you should start with an Inn, Shrine, Monastery, or Watchtower. In addition, you may also purchase and construct 1 House, Mansion, Noble Villa, or Tenement. If your first building is an Inn, you must construct a House or Tenement next to it, as building an Inn requires an adjacent House or Tenement.</p>\n<p>When you complete these steps, you've founded your settlement! If this is your first settlement, it's considered your kingdom's capital city.</p>\n<h1>Capital City</h1>\n<p>A kingdom should have a capital city - the seat of your power. Your first settlement is your capital. If you want to designate a different settlement as the capital, you may do so in Step 6 of the Edict phase. Your capital city primarily comes into play if your kingdom loses hexes. If you change the capital city, attempt a Stability check. Success means Unrest increases by 1; failure means Unrest increases by 1d6.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf-content.kingdom-building-player.JWKZgqSZ2jmSEpxQ]{2.2.2.1. Terrain and Terrain Costs}</p>"}

The kingdom's alignment represents the majority outlook and behavior of the people within that kingdom when they're considered as a group. (Individual citizens and even some leaders may be of different alignments.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chaotic and Good kingdom's are more Loyal</li>\n<li>Lawful and Evil kingdom's are more Economic</li>\n<li>Neutral kingdom's are more stable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A kingdom's alignment rarely changes, though at the GM's option, it can shift through the actions of its rulers or its people.</p>\n<h1>Capital City</h1>\n<p>A kingdom should have a capital city - the seat of your power. Your first settlement is your capital. If you want to designate a different settlement as the capital, you may do so in Step 6 of the Edict phase. Your capital city primarily comes into play if your kingdom loses hexes. If you change the capital city, attempt a Stability check to determine what affect this has on the kingdom's unrest.</p>\n<h1>Size</h1>\n<p>This is how many hexes the kingdom claims. A new kingdom's Size is 1. This affects a kingdoms consumption and its control DC.</p>\n<h1>Population</h1>\n<p>Actual population numbers don't factor into your kingdom's statistics but can be fun to track anyway. The population of your kingdom is equal to the population of all your settlements.</p>\n<p>A settlement's population is approximately equal to the number of completed lots within its districts &times; 250. A grid that has all 36 lots filled with buildings has a population of approximately 9,000.</p>\n<h1>Build Points</h1>\n<p>The units of a kingdom's wealth and productivity are build points (BP). Build points are an abstraction representing the kingdom's expendable assets, not just gold in the treasury. Build points include raw materials (such as livestock, lumber, land, seed, and ore), tangible goods (such as wagons, weapons, and candles), and people (artisans, laborers, and colonists). Together, these assets represent the labor and productive output of your citizens.</p>\n<p>You spend BP on tasks necessary to develop and protect your kingdom - planting farms, creating roads, constructing buildings, raising armies, and so on. These things are made at your command, but they are not yours. The cities, roads, farms, and buildings belong to the citizens who build them and use them to live and work every day, and those acts of living and working create more BP for the kingdom. As the leaders, you use your power and influence to direct the economic and constructive activity of your kingdom, deciding what gets built, when, and where.</p>\n<p>Build points don't have a precise exchange rate to gold pieces because they don't represent exact amounts of specific resources. For example, you can't really equate the productivity of a blacksmith with that of a stable, as their goods are used for different things and aren't produced at the same rate, but both of them contribute to a kingdom's overall economy. In general, 1 BP is worth approximately 4,000 gp; use this value to get a sense of how costly various kingdom expenditures are. In practice, it is not a simple matter to convert one currency to the other, but there are certain ways for your PC to spend gp to increase the kingdom's BP or withdraw BP and turn them into gold for your character to spend.</p>\n<h1>Consumption</h1>\n<p>Consumption indicates how many BP are required to keep the kingdom functioning each month. Your kingdom's Consumption is equal to its Size, modified by settlements and terrain improvements (such as Farms and Fisheries). Consumption can never go below 0</p>\n<h1>Treasury</h1>\n<p>As your kingdom earns money, favors, resources, and power, its Build Point total increases. In the Kingmaker Adventure Path, you begin with 50 BP in your kingdom's treasury (this amount is bestowed upon you by the swordlords of Restov).</p>\n<h1>Control DC</h1>\n<p>Some kingdom actions require a check (1d20 + modifiers) to succeed - this is known as a control check. The base DC for a control check is equal to 20 + the kingdom's Size in hexes + the total number of districts in all your settlements + any other modifiers from special circumstances or effects. Unless otherwise stated, the DC of a kingdom check is the Control DC.</p>\n<h1>Kingdom Check</h1>\n<p>A kingdom has three attributes: Economy, Loyalty, and Stability. Your kingdom's initial scores in each of these attributes is 0, plus modifiers for kingdom alignment, bonuses provided by the leaders, and any other modifiers.</p>\n<p>Many kingdom actions and events require you to attempt a kingdom check, either using your Economy, Loyalty, or Stability attribute (1d20 + the appropriate attribute + other modifiers). You cannot take 10 or take 20 on a kingdom check. Kingdom checks automatically fail on a natural 1 and automatically succeed on a natural 20.</p>\n<h1>Economy</h1>\n<p>This attribute measures the productivity of your kingdom's workers and the vibrancy of its trade, both in terms of money and in terms of information, innovation, and technology. Your kingdom's initial Economy is 0 plus your kingdom's alignment and leadership modifiers.</p>\n<h1>Loyalty</h1>\n<p>Loyalty refers to the sense of goodwill among your people, their ability to live peaceably together even in times of crisis, and to fight for one another when needed. Your kingdom's initial Loyalty is 0 plus your kingdom's alignment and any modifiers from your kingdom's leadership role.</p>\n<h1>Stability</h1>\n<p>Stability refers to the physical and social well-being of the kingdom, from the health and security of its citizenry to the vitality of its natural resources and its ability to maximize their use. Your kingdom's initial Stability is 0 plus your kingdom's alignment and leadership modifiers.</p>\n<h1>Unrest</h1>\n<p>Your kingdom's Unrest indicates how rebellious your citizens are. Your kingdom's initial Unrest is 0. Unrest can never fall below 0 (anything that would modify it to less than 0 is wasted). Subtract your kingdom's Unrest from all Economy, Loyalty, and Stability checks.</p>"}
{"_id":"rVzsMYz0dip3bNHF","name":"3.2. Magic Items In Settlements","flags":{"importid":"UNetWrLFaYOZnpG3"},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>In addition to the commonly available items in a settlement as determined by its base value, some buildings increase the likelihood of having specific or unusual magic items available for purchase.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Gaining Item Slots: When you construct one of these buildings, mark the appropriate boxes in the Magic Items section of the settlement's District Grid; this indicates that the settlement has gained a slot for an item of that type.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Filling Item Slots: </b>In Step 3 of the Upkeep phase, you roll to fill vacant magic item slots in each district. Roll d% once for each district that has an open magic item slot (if the district has more than one, select one randomly). There is a 50% chance (51-100) that an appropriate magic item becomes available in that slot. This item's price cannot exceed the base value for the settlement (reroll if the item's price exceeds the settlement's base value).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Example </b>: Jessica's settlement has a base value of 200 gp. She built an Herbalist last turn, giving the settlement 1 minor potion slot. In the Upkeep phase this turn, she rolls d% and gets a result of 62, meaning she can roll a random minor potion to fill the settlement's empty slot. She rolls on Table 15-12: Potions ( Core Rulebook 478) and gets a result of 45, indicating a potion of a 1st-level spell. If she had rolled anything more valuable than the 200 gp base value for her settlement, she would have to reroll until she got an acceptable result. Once a magic item is rolled for a settlement in this way, it remains on the market until someone purchases it.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment includes extensive random magic item tables for specific slots and price increments. These tables may be more convenient than using the magic item tables in the Core Rulebook.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Emptying Item Slots: </b>If you are unsatisfied with a magic item generated by a settlement, there are three ways to purge an undesirable item and make its slot vacant.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The first is to purchase it with your own gp, which makes it your personal property and means you may do with it what you please (use it, sell it at half price for gold, deposit it in the kingdom's Treasury during the next Income phase, use it as a reward for a local general, and so on).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The second method is to manipulate your kingdom's economy to encourage an NPC to purchase the item (such as a random adventurer passing through the settlement). During Step 3 of the Income phase, you may attempt one Economy check for each filled slot you want to empty. For every such check after the first one in a turn, your Economy decreases by 1, since these manipulations are harmful to your kingdom's economy and typically only serve to get rid of an item you consider undesirable. If the check fails, nothing happens. If the check succeeds, erase the item from that slot; you may attempt to fill the empty slot as normal in the next Upkeep phase. You do not gain any gp or BP from this sale; the money goes to the building's owner, who uses it to acquire or craft the next item.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The third way is to spend BP (1 BP = 2,000 gp) to purchase the item. If you take the item for your own use, this counts as withdrawing BP from the Treasury for your personal use (see Step 1 of the Income Phase - Make Withdrawals from the Treasury). If you use the item in a way that doesn't directly benefit you or the other PCs (such as giving it to a hero of your army or donating it to a settlement as a religious or historical artifact), then purchasing it is essentially like other kingdom expenditures and does not increase Unrest or decrease Loyalty</p>\n\t\t\t\t</text>\n\t\t\t"}
{"_id":"td7XTFsNu2SfSe3v","name":"3.3.1. Building Descriptions","flags":{"importid":"PexyMuwOJBUV3nTL"},"content":"<text type=\"formattedtext\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Buildings are described in the following format.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Building Name: </b>The type of buildings contained in this lot. In most cases, each lot represents numerous buildings of that type, rather than a single edifice.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Cost: </b>The cost in BP to construct the building.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Lots: </b>How many lots the building fills.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Kingdom </b>: Building modifiers to Economy, Loyalty, and Stability stack, affect your entire kingdom, and are ongoing from turn to turn. Modifiers to Unrest occur once when the building is completed. This category also lists any bonuses to Fame from having the building.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Discount: </b>Some buildings halve the cost of constructing a related type of building in the same settlement. This cost reduction applies only to the first constructed building of the types listed in this line. For example, an Academy halves the cost of your next Library in that settlement; if you build a second Library in that settlement, you pay the normal cost for it. If 2 buildings give the same discount, only one discount applies per new building, but you may construct 2 buildings at the discounted cost. For example, Market and Theater both halve the cost of an Inn; if your settlement has a Market and a Theater, you may construct 2 Inns at half cost (the Market discounts one, and the Theater discounts the other).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Limit: </b>This lists limitations on the number of buildings of this type, special requirements for adjacent buildings, or prohibitions against certain buildings being adjacent.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>For most buildings, you can construct as many of them as you want in a settlement, but some are limited in the number that can be built per settlement or district. For example, you can only construct 1 Arena per settlement.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some buildings require that you construct them adjacent to at least 1 or 2 of a specific kind of building or feature of the settlement. For example, a Shop or Tavern must be adjacent to a House or Mansion. The required adjacent building can only count toward 1 building that requires it. For example, if you have a House and a Shop, that House can't be used to meet the requirement for another Shop or a Tavern; you have to construct a new House and use it to meet the requirement of the new Shop or Tavern.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some buildings cannot be adjacent to certain buildings. For example, you can't construct a Tannery next to a House, Mansion, Noble Villa, or Tenement. If you want to use a lot for this type of building, you must demolish all prohibited adjacent structures first (see Demolition).</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If you get overzealous in constructing a particular type of building in a settlement, the GM should feel free to add events to discourage this practice. For example, a settlement with too many Dumps is prone to otyugh and wererat attacks, and a settlement with too many Graveyards tends to have frequent undead attacks. This should not occur, however, if you build too many Houses, Parks, Tenements, or Waterways.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Upgrade To/From: </b>Some buildings can be converted into a more advanced form of the existing building, such as converting a Shrine into a Temple. To upgrade a building, pay the BP cost difference between the current building and the new building. Remove the modifiers from the old building and apply the modifiers from the new building. Upgrading counts as constructing a building for the purpose of the maximum number of buildings you can construct on your turn. You can't upgrade a building to a larger one if there isn't space in the District Grid for the building's new size.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Special: </b>This lists any other effect the building has, such as increasing Defense, the settlement's base value, or the output of a nearby Mine.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Magic Items: </b>This lists any magic item slot the building creates, which may be filled in the Upkeep phase (see Magic Items in Settlements). If a building lists multiple options within a category (such as \"1 minor potion or wondrous item\"), it has an equal chance for each option.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Settlement: </b>This lists settlement modifiers from page 205 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide that affect specific skills within the settlement. These modifiers are ongoing from turn to turn, but apply only to skill checks within that settlement (not other settlements in the hex or anywhere else in your kingdom). Note that the GameMastery Guide also uses a settlement statistic called Economy; to avoid confusion with the Economy kingdom score, this book renames the Economy settlement statistic \"Productivity.\"</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><b>Note: </b>These buildings are tokens within the Kingdom Building token folder.

Then, to claim the hex, spend 1 BP; this establishes the hex as part of your kingdom and increases your kingdom's Size by 1 (see Steps 2 and 3 of Founding a Settlement for more details).</p>\n<p><strong>Table: Improvement Edicts </strong>(see above) tells you the maximum number of hexes you can claim per turn.</p>\n<p><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf-content.kingdom-building-player\" data-id=\"WOnvK7WUCQTgTiex\"> Founding A Settlement</a></p>\n<p>You may abandon any number of hexes to reduce your kingdom's Size (which you may wish to do to manage Consumption). Doing so increases Unrest for each hex abandoned (the Unrest is increased more if the hex contained a settlement). This otherwise functions like losing a hex due to Unrest (see Step 4 of the Upkeep phase).</p>\n<h1>Step 3 - Build Terrain Improvements</h1>\n<p>You may spend BP to build terrain improvements like Farms, Forts, Roads, Mines, and Quarries (see Terrain Improvements below).</p>\n<p>You may also prepare a hex for constructing a settlement. Depending on the site, this may involve clearing trees, moving boulders, digging sanitation trenches, and so on. See the Preparation Cost column on Table: Terrain and Terrain Improvements to determine how many BP this requires.</p>\n<p><strong>Table: Improvement Edicts </strong>(see above) tells you the maximum number of terrain improvements you can make per turn</p>\n<p><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf-content.kingdom-building-player\" data-id=\"EvtV6wtsiZkp9bwj\"> Terrain Improvements</a></p>\n<h1>Step 4 - Create and Improve Settlements</h1>\n<p>You may create a settlement in a claimed hex (see Founding a Settlement). Table: Improvement Edicts (above) tells you the maximum number of settlements you can establish per turn.</p>\n<p>You may construct a building in any settlement in your kingdom. When a building is completed, apply its modifiers to your kingdom sheet. Table: Improvement Edicts (above) tells you the maximum number of buildings you can construct in your kingdom per turn.</p>\n<p>The first House, Mansion, Noble Villa, or Tenement your kingdom builds each turn does not count against that limit.</p>\n<p><a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf-content.kingdom-building-player\" data-id=\"DnXdqwS9SPbD2zUW\"> 3.
